chapter
after
the
flood
the
terror
which
would
not
end
for
another
twentyeight
years
if
it
ever
did
end
began
so
far
as
i
know
or
can
tell
with
a
boat
made
from
a
sheet
of
newspaper
floating
down
a
gutter
swollen
with
rain
the
boat
bobbed
listed
righted
itself
again
dived
bravely
through
treacherous
whirlpools
and
continued
on
its
way
down
witcham
street
toward
the
traffic
light
which
marked
the
intersection
of
witcham
and
jackson
the
three
vertical
lenses
on
all
sides
of
the
traffic
light
were
dark
this
afternoon
in
the
fall
of
and
the
houses
were
all
dark
too
there
had
been
steady
rain
for
a
week
now
and
two
days
ago
the
winds
had
come
as
well
most
sections
of
derry
had
lost
their
power
then
and
it
was
not
back
on
yet
a
small
boy
in
a
yellow
slicker
and
red
galoshes
ran
cheerfully
along
beside
the
newspaper
boat
the
rain
had
not
stopped
but
it
was
finally
slackening
it
tapped
on
the
yellow
hood
of
the
boy
slicker
sounding
to
his
ears
like
rain
on
a
shed
roof
a
comfortable
almost
cozy
sound
the
boy
in
the
yellow
slicker
was
george
denbrough
he
was
six
his
brother
william
known
to
most
of
the
kids
at
derry
elementary
school
and
even
to
the
teachers
who
would
never
have
used
the
nickname
to
his
face
as
stuttering
bill
was
at
home
hacking
out
the
last
of
a
nasty
case
of
influenza
in
that
autumn
of
eight
months
before
the
real
horrors
began
and
twentyeight
years
before
the
final
showdown
stuttering
bill
was
ten
years
old
bill
had
made
the
boat
beside
which
george
now
ran
he
had
made
i
sitting
up
in
bed
his
back
propped
against
a
pile
of
pillows
while
their
mother
played
fiir
elise
on
the
piano
in
the
parlor
and
rain
swept
restlessly
against
his
bedroom
window
about
threequarters
of
the
way
down
the
block
as
one
headed
toward
the
intersection
and
the
dead
traffic
light
witcham
street
was
blocked
to
motor
traffic
by
smudgepots
and
four
orange
sawhorses
stencilled
across
each
of
the
horses
was
derry
dept
of
public
works
beyond
them
the
rain
had
spilled
out
of
gutters
clogged
with
branches
and
rocks
and
big
sticky
piles
of
autumn
leaves
the
water
had
first
pried
fingerholds
in
the
paving
and
then
snatched
whole
greedy
handfuls
all
of
this
by
the
third
day
of
the
rains
by
noon
of
the
fourth
day
big
chunks
of
the
street
surface
were
boating
through
the
intersection
of
jackson
and
witcham
like
miniature
white
water
rafts
by
that
time
many
people
in
derry
had
begun
to
make
nervous
jokes
about
arks
the
public
works
department
had
managed
to
keep
jackson
street
open
but
witcham
was
impassable
from
the
sawhorses
all
the
way
to
the
center
of
town
but
everyone
agreed
the
worst
was
over
the
kenduskeag
stream
had
crested
just
below
its
banks
in
the
barrens
and
bare
inches
below
the
concrete
sides
of
the
canal
which
channelled
it
tightly
as
it
passed
through
downtown
right
now
a
gang
of
men
zack
denbrough
george
and
bill
father
among
them
were
removing
the
sandbags
they
had
thrown
up
the
day
before
with
such
panicky
haste
yesterday
overflow
and
expensive
flood
damage
had
seemed
almost
inevitable
god
knew
it
had
happened
before
the
flooding
in
had
been
a
disaster
which
had
cost
millions
of
dollars
and
almost
two
dozen
lives
that
was
a
long
time
ago
but
there
were
still
enough
people
around
who
remembered
it
to
scare
the
rest
one
of
the
flood
victims
had
been
found
twentyfive
miles
east
in
bucksport
the
fish
had
eaten
this
unfortunate
gentleman
eyes
three
of
his
fingers
his
penis
and
most
of
his
left
foot
clutched
in
what
remained
of
his
hands
had
been
a
ford
steering
wheel
now
though
the
river
was
receding
and
when
the
new
bangor
hydro
dam
went
in
upstream
the
river
would
cease
to
be
a
threat
or
so
said
zack
denbrough
who
worked
for
bangor
hydroelectric
as
for
the
rest
well
future
floods
could
take
care
of
themselves
the
thing
was
to
get
through
this
one
to
get
the
power
back
on
and
then
to
forget
it
in
derry
such
forgetting
of
tragedy
and
disaster
was
almost
an
art
as
bill
denbrough
would
come
to
discover
in
the
course
of
time
george
paused
just
beyond
the
sawhorses
at
the
edge
of
a
deep
ravine
that
had
been
cut
through
the
tar
surface
of
witcham
street
this
ravine
ran
on
an
almost
exact
diagonal
it
ended
on
the
far
side
of
the
street
roughly
forty
feet
farther
down
the
hill
from
where
he
now
stood
on
the
right
he
laughed
aloud
the
sound
of
solitary
childish
glee
a
bright
runner
in
that
gray
afternoon
as
a
vagary
of
the
flowing
water
took
his
paper
boat
into
a
scale
model
rapids
which
had
been
formed
by
the
break
n
the
tar
the
urgent
water
had
cut
a
channel
which
ran
along
the
diagonal
and
so
his
boat
travelled
from
one
side
of
witcham
street
to
the
other
the
current
carrying
it
so
fast
that
george
had
to
sprint
to
keep
up
with
it
water
sprayed
out
from
beneath
his
galoshes
in
muddy
sheets
their
buckles
made
a
jolly
jingling
as
george
denbrough
ran
toward
his
strange
death
and
the
feeling
which
filled
him
at
that
moment
was
clear
and
simple
love
for
his
brother
bill
love
and
a
touch
of
regret
that
bill
couldn't
be
here
to
see
this
and
be
a
part
of
it
of
course
he
would
try
to
describe
it
to
bill
when
he
got
home
but
he
knew
he
wouldn't
be
able
to
make
bill
see
it
the
way
bill
would
have
been
able
to
make
him
see
it
if
their
positions
had
been
reversed
bill
was
good
at
reading
and
writing
but
even
at
his
age
george
was
wise
enough
to
know
that
wasn't
the
only
reason
why
bill
got
all
a
on
his
report
cards
or
why
his
teachers
liked
his
compositions
so
well
telling
was
only
part
of
it
bill
was
good
at
seeing
the
boat
nearly
whistled
along
the
diagonal
channel
just
a
page
torn
from
the
classified
section
of
the
derry
news
but
now
george
imagined
it
as
a
ft
boat
in
a
war
movie
like
the
ones
he
sometimes
saw
down
at
the
derry
theater
with
bill
at
saturday
matinees
a
war
picture
with
john
wayne
fighting
the
japs
the
prow
of
the
newspaper
boat
threw
sprays
of
water
to
either
side
as
it
rushed
along
and
then
it
reached
the
gutter
on
the
left
side
of
witcham
street
a
fresh
streamlet
rushed
over
the
break
in
the
tar
at
this
point
creating
a
fairly
large
whirlpool
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
boat
must
be
swamped
and
capsize
it
leaned
alarmingly
and
then
george
cheered
as
it
righted
itself
turned
and
went
racing
on
down
toward
the
intersection
george
sprinted
to
catch
up
over
his
head
a
grim
gust
of
october
wind
rattled
the
trees
now
almost
completely
unburdened
of
their
freight
of
colored
leaves
by
the
storm
which
had
been
this
year
a
reaper
of
the
most
ruthless
sort
sitting
up
in
bed
his
cheeks
still
flushed
with
heat
but
his
fever
like
the
kenduskeag
finally
receding
bill
had
finished
the
boat
but
when
george
reached
for
it
bill
held
it
out
of
reach
n
now
get
me
the
pp
paraffin
what
that
where
is
it
its
on
the
cellar
shuhshuh
shelf
as
you
go
ddownstairs
bill
said
in
a
box
that
says
guhguhhulf
gulf
bring
that
to
me
and
a
knife
and
a
bbowl
and
a
puhpack
of
mub
mub
matches
george
had
gone
obediently
to
get
these
things
he
could
hear
his
mother
playing
the
piano
not
fiir
elise
now
but
something
else
he
didn't
like
so
well
something
that
sounded
dry
and
fussy
he
could
hear
rain
flicking
steadily
against
the
kitchen
windows
these
were
comfortable
sounds
but
the
thought
of
the
cellar
was
not
a
bit
comfortable
he
did
not
like
the
cellar
and
he
did
not
like
going
down
the
cellar
stairs
because
he
always
imagined
there
was
something
down
there
in
the
dark
that
was
silly
of
course
his
father
said
so
and
his
mother
said
so
and
even
more
important
bill
said
so
but
still
he
did
not
even
like
opening
the
door
to
flick
on
the
light
because
he
always
had
the
idea
this
was
so
exquisitely
stupid
he
didn't
dare
tell
anyone
that
while
he
was
feeling
for
the
light
switch
some
horrible
clawed
paw
would
settle
lightly
over
his
wrist
and
then
jerk
him
down
into
the
darkness
that
smelled
of
dirt
and
wet
and
dim
rotted
vegetables
stupid
there
were
no
things
with
claws
all
hairy
and
full
of
killing
spite
every
now
and
then
someone
went
crazy
and
killed
a
lot
of
people
sometimes
chet
huntley
told
about
such
things
on
the
evening
news
and
of
course
there
were
commies
but
there
was
no
weirdo
monster
living
down
in
their
cellar
still
this
idea
lingered
in
those
interminable
moments
while
he
was
groping
for
the
switch
with
his
nght
hand
his
left
arm
curled
around
the
doorjamb
in
a
deathgrip
that
cellar
smell
seemed
to
intensify
until
it
filled
the
world
smells
of
dirt
and
wet
and
longgone
vegetables
would
merge
into
one
unmistakable
ineluctable
smell
the
smell
of
the
monster
the
apotheosis
of
all
monsters
it
was
the
smell
of
something
for
which
he
had
no
name
the
smell
of
it
crouched
and
lurking
and
ready
to
spring
a
creature
which
would
eat
anything
but
which
was
especially
hungry
for
boymeat
he
had
opened
the
door
that
morning
and
had
groped
interminably
for
the
switch
holding
the
jamb
in
his
usual
deathgrip
his
eyes
squinched
shut
the
tip
of
his
tongue
poked
from
the
comer
of
his
mouth
like
an
agonized
rootlet
searching
for
water
in
a
place
of
drought
funny
sure
you
betcha
lookit
you
georgie
georgie
scared
of
the
dark
what
a
baby
the
sound
of
the
piano
came
from
what
his
father
called
the
living
room
and
what
his
mother
called
the
parlor
it
sounded
like
music
from
another
world
far
away
the
way
talk
and
laughter
on
a
summercrowded
beach
must
sound
to
an
exhausted
swimmer
who
struggles
with
the
undertow
his
fingers
found
the
switch
ah
they
snapped
it
and
nothing
no
light
oh
cripes
the
power
george
snatched
his
arm
back
as
if
from
a
basket
filled
with
snakes
he
stepped
back
from
the
open
cellar
door
his
heart
hurrying
in
his
chest
the
power
was
out
of
course
he
had
forgotten
the
power
was
out
jeezlycrow
what
now
go
back
and
tell
bill
he
couldn't
get
the
box
of
paraffin
because
the
power
was
out
and
he
was
afraid
that
something
might
get
him
as
he
stood
on
the
cellar
stairs
something
that
wasn't
a
commie
or
a
mass
murderer
but
a
creature
much
worse
than
either
that
it
would
simply
slither
part
of
its
rotted
self
up
between
the
stair
risers
and
grab
his
ankle
that
would
go
over
big
wouldn't
it
others
might
laugh
at
such
a
fancy
but
bill
wouldn't
laugh
bill
would
be
mad
bill
would
say
grow
up
georgie
do
you
want
this
boat
or
not
as
if
this
thought
were
his
cue
bill
called
from
his
bedroom
did
you
dddie
out
there
juhgeorgi
no
i'm
gettin
it
bill
george
called
back
at
once
he
rubbed
at
his
arms
trying
to
make
the
guilty
gooseflesh
disappear
and
be
smooth
skin
again
i
just
stopped
to
get
a
drink
of
water
well
bhurry
up
so
he
walked
down
the
four
steps
to
the
cellar
shelf
his
heart
a
warm
beating
hammer
in
his
throat
the
hair
on
the
nape
of
his
neck
standing
at
attention
his
eyes
hot
his
hands
cold
sure
that
at
any
moment
the
cellar
door
would
swing
shut
on
its
own
closing
off
the
white
light
falling
through
the
kitchen
windows
and
then
he
would
hear
it
something
worse
than
all
the
commies
and
murderers
in
the
world
worse
than
the
japs
worse
than
attila
the
hun
worse
than
the
somethings
in
a
hundred
horror
movies
it
growling
deeply
he
would
hear
the
growl
in
those
lunatic
seconds
before
it
pounced
on
him
and
unzipped
his
guts
the
cellarsmell
was
worse
than
ever
today
because
of
the
flood
their
house
was
high
on
witcham
street
near
the
crest
of
the
hill
and
they
had
escaped
the
worst
of
it
but
there
was
still
standing
water
down
there
that
had
seeped
in
through
the
old
rock
dundations
the
smell
was
low
and
unpleasant
making
you
want
to
take
only
the
shallowest
breaths
george
sifted
through
the
junk
on
the
shelf
as
fast
as
he
could
old
cans
of
kiwi
shoepolish
and
shoepolish
rags
a
broken
kerosene
lamp
two
mostly
empty
bottles
of
windex
an
old
flat
can
of
turtle
wax
for
some
reason
this
can
struck
him
and
he
spent
nearly
thirty
seconds
looking
at
the
turtle
on
the
lid
with
a
kind
of
hypnotic
wonder
then
he
tossed
it
back
and
here
it
was
at
last
a
square
box
with
the
word
gulf
on
it
george
snatched
it
and
ran
up
the
stairs
as
fast
as
he
could
suddenly
aware
that
his
shirttail
was
out
and
suddenly
sure
that
his
shirttail
would
be
his
undoing
the
thing
in
the
cellar
would
allow
him
to
get
almost
all
the
way
out
and
then
it
would
grab
the
tail
of
his
shirt
and
snatch
him
back
and
he
reached
the
kitchen
and
swept
the
door
shut
behind
him
it
banged
gustily
he
leaned
back
against
it
with
his
eyes
closed
sweat
popped
out
on
his
arms
and
forehead
the
box
of
paraffin
gripped
tightly
in
one
hand
the
piano
had
come
to
a
stop
and
his
mom
voice
floated
to
him
georgie
can't
you
slam
that
door
a
little
harder
next
time
maybe
you
could
break
some
of
the
plates
in
the
welsh
dresser
if
you
really
tried
sorry
mom
he
called
back
georgie
you
waste
bill
said
from
his
bedroom
he
pitched
his
voice
low
so
their
mother
would
not
hear
george
snickered
a
little
his
fear
was
already
gone
it
had
slipped
away
from
him
as
easily
as
a
nghtmare
slips
away
from
a
man
who
awakes
coldskinned
and
gasping
from
its
grip
who
feels
his
body
and
stares
at
his
surroundings
to
make
sure
that
none
of
it
ever
happened
and
who
then
begins
at
once
to
forget
it
half
is
gone
by
the
time
his
feet
hit
the
floor
threequarters
of
it
by
the
time
he
emerges
from
the
shower
and
begins
to
towel
off
all
of
it
by
the
time
he
finishes
his
breakfast
all
gone
until
the
next
time
when
in
the
grip
of
the
nightmare
all
fears
will
be
remembered
that
turtle
george
thought
going
to
the
counter
drawer
where
the
matches
were
kept
where
did
i
see
a
turtle
like
that
before
but
no
answer
came
and
he
dismissed
the
question
he
got
a
pack
of
matches
from
the
drawer
a
knife
from
the
rack
holding
the
sharp
edge
studiously
away
from
his
body
as
his
dad
had
taught
him
and
a
small
bowl
from
the
welsh
dresser
in
the
dining
room
then
he
went
back
into
bill
room
wwhat
an
ahole
you
are
juhgeorgie
bill
said
amiably
enough
and
pushed
back
some
of
the
sickstuff
on
his
nighttable
an
empty
glass
a
pitcher
of
water
kleenex
books
a
bottle
of
vicks
vaporub
the
smell
of
which
bill
would
associate
all
his
life
with
thick
phlegmy
chests
and
snotty
noses
the
old
philco
radio
was
there
playing
not
chopin
or
bach
but
a
little
richard
tune
very
softly
however
so
softly
that
little
richard
was
robbed
of
all
his
raw
and
elemental
power
their
mother
who
had
studied
classical
piano
at
juilliard
hated
rock
and
roll
she
did
not
nerely
dislike
it
she
abominated
it
tm
no
ahole
george
said
sitting
on
the
edge
of
bill
bed
and
putting
the
things
he
had
gathered
on
the
nighttable
yes
you
are
bill
said
nothing
but
a
great
big
brown
ahole
that
you
george
tried
to
imagine
a
kid
who
was
nothing
but
a
great
big
ahole
on
legs
and
began
to
gigele
your
ahole
is
bigger
than
augusta
bill
said
beginning
to
giggle
too
four
ahole
is
bigger
than
the
whole
state
george
replied
this
broke
both
boys
up
for
nearly
two
minutes
there
followed
a
whispered
conversation
of
the
sort
which
means
very
little
to
anyone
save
small
boys
accusations
of
who
was
the
biggest
ahole
who
had
the
biggest
ahole
which
ahole
was
the
brownest
and
so
on
finally
bill
said
one
of
the
forbidden
words
he
accused
george
of
being
a
big
brown
shitty
ahole
and
they
both
got
laughing
hard
bill
laughter
turned
into
a
coughing
fit
as
it
finally
began
to
taper
off
by
then
bill
face
had
gone
a
plummy
shade
which
george
regarded
with
some
alarm
the
piano
stopped
again
they
both
looked
in
the
direction
of
the
parlor
listening
for
the
pianobench
to
scrape
back
listening
for
their
mother
impatient
footsteps
bill
buried
his
mouth
in
the
crook
of
his
elbow
stifling
the
last
of
the
coughs
pointing
at
the
pitcher
at
the
same
time
george
poured
him
a
glass
of
water
which
he
drank
off
the
piano
began
once
more
fiir
elise
again
stuttering
bill
never
forgot
that
piece
and
even
many
years
later
it
never
failed
to
bring
gooseflesh
to
his
arms
and
back
his
heart
would
drop
and
he
would
remember
my
mother
was
playing
that
the
day
georgie
died
you
gonna
cough
anymore
bill
no
bill
pulled
a
kleenex
from
the
box
made
a
rumbling
sound
in
his
dest
spat
phlegm
into
the
tissue
screwed
it
up
and
tossed
it
into
the
wastebasket
by
his
bed
which
was
filled
with
similar
twists
of
tissue
then
he
opened
the
box
of
paraffin
and
dropped
a
waxy
cube
of
the
stuff
into
his
palm
george
watched
him
closely
but
without
speaking
or
questioning
bill
didn't
like
george
talking
to
him
while
he
did
stuff
but
george
had
learned
that
if
he
just
kept
his
mouth
shut
bill
would
usually
explain
what
he
was
doing
bill
used
the
knife
to
cut
off
a
small
piece
of
the
paraffin
cube
he
put
the
piece
in
the
bowl
then
struck
a
match
and
put
it
on
top
of
the
paraffin
the
two
boys
watched
the
small
yellow
flame
as
the
dying
wind
drove
rain
against
the
window
in
occasional
spatters
got
to
waterproof
the
boat
or
it'll
just
get
wet
and
sink
bill
said
when
he
was
with
george
his
stutter
was
light
sometimes
he
didn't
stutter
at
all
in
school
however
it
could
become
so
bad
that
talking
became
impossible
for
him
communication
would
cease
and
bill
schoolmates
would
look
somewhere
else
while
bill
clutched
the
sides
of
his
desk
his
face
growing
almost
as
red
as
his
hair
his
eyes
squeezed
into
slits
as
he
tried
to
winch
some
word
out
of
his
stubborn
throat
sometimes
most
times
the
word
would
come
other
times
it
simply
refused
he
had
been
hit
by
a
car
when
he
was
three
and
knocked
into
the
side
of
a
building
he
had
remained
unconscious
for
seven
hours
mom
said
it
was
that
accident
which
had
caused
the
stutter
george
sometimes
got
the
feeling
that
his
dad
and
bill
himself
was
not
so
sure
the
piece
of
paraffin
in
the
bowl
was
almost
entirely
melted
the
matchflame
guttered
lower
growing
blue
as
it
hugged
the
cardboard
stick
and
then
it
went
out
bill
dipped
his
finger
into
the
liquid
jerked
it
out
with
a
faint
hiss
he
smiled
apologetically
at
george
ho
he
said
after
a
few
seconds
he
dipped
his
finger
in
again
and
began
to
smear
the
wax
along
the
sides
of
the
boat
where
it
quickly
dried
to
a
milky
haze
can
i
do
some
george
asked
okay
just
don't
get
any
on
the
blankets
or
mom'll
kill
you
george
dipped
his
finger
into
the
paraffin
which
was
now
very
warm
but
no
longer
hot
and
began
to
spread
it
along
the
other
side
of
the
boat
don't
put
on
so
much
you
ahole
bill
said
you
want
to
sink
it
on
its
mmaiden
cruise
t'm
sorry
that
all
right
just
ggo
easy
george
finished
the
other
side
then
held
the
boat
in
his
hands
it
felt
a
little
heavier
but
not
much
too
cool
he
said
i'm
gonna
go
out
and
sail
it
yeah
you
do
tha
bill
said
he
suddenly
looked
tired
tired
and
still
not
very
well
wish
you
could
come
george
said
he
really
did
bill
sometimes
got
bossy
after
awhile
but
he
always
had
the
coolest
ideas
and
he
hardly
ever
hit
it
your
boat
really
she
bill
said
you
call
boats
shshe
she
then
i
wish
i
could
come
too
bill
said
glumly
well
george
shifted
from
one
foot
to
the
other
the
boat
in
his
hands
you
put
on
your
rainstuff
bill
said
or
you'll
wind
up
with
the
fluhhu
like
me
probably
catch
it
anyway
from
my
juhgerms
thanks
bill
it
a
neat
boat
and
he
did
something
he
hadn't
done
for
a
long
time
something
bill
never
forgot
he
leaned
over
and
kissed
his
brother
cheek
youll
catch
it
for
sure
now
you
ahole
bill
said
but
he
seemed
cheered
up
all
the
same
he
smiled
at
george
put
all
this
stuff
back
too
or
mom'll
have
a
bbird
sure
he
gathered
up
the
waterproofing
equipment
and
crossed
the
room
the
boat
perched
precariously
on
top
of
the
paraffin
box
which
was
sitting
askew
in
the
little
bowl
juh
juhgeorgie
george
turned
back
to
look
at
his
brother
be
ccareful
sure
his
brow
creased
a
little
that
was
something
your
mom
said
not
your
big
brother
it
was
as
strange
as
him
giving
bill
a
kiss
sure
i
will
he
went
out
bill
never
saw
him
again
now
here
he
was
chasing
his
boat
down
the
left
side
of
witcham
street
he
was
running
fast
but
the
water
was
running
faster
and
his
boat
was
pulling
ahead
he
heard
a
deepening
roar
and
saw
that
fifty
yards
farther
down
the
hill
the
water
in
the
gutter
was
cascading
into
a
stormdrain
that
was
still
open
ii
was
a
long
dark
semicircle
cut
into
the
curbing
and
as
george
watched
a
stripped
branch
its
bark
as
dark
and
glistening
as
sealskin
shot
into
the
stormdrain
maw
it
hung
up
there
for
a
moment
and
then
slipped
down
inside
that
was
where
his
boat
was
headed
oh
shit
and
shinol
he
yelled
dismayed
he
put
on
speed
and
for
a
moment
he
thought
he
would
catch
the
boat
then
one
of
his
feet
slipped
and
he
went
sprawling
skinning
one
knee
and
crying
out
in
pain
from
his
new
pavementlevel
perspective
he
watched
his
boat
swing
around
twice
momentarily
caught
in
another
whirlpool
and
then
disappear
shit
and
shinol
he
yelled
again
and
slammed
his
fist
down
on
the
pavement
that
hurt
too
and
he
began
to
cry
a
little
what
a
stupid
way
to
lose
the
boat
he
got
up
and
walked
over
to
the
stormdrain
he
dropped
to
his
knees
and
peered
in
the
water
made
a
dank
hollow
sound
as
it
fell
into
the
darkness
it
was
a
spooky
sound
it
reminded
him
of
huh
the
sound
was
jerked
out
of
him
as
if
on
a
string
and
he
recoiled
there
were
yellow
eyes
in
there
the
sort
of
eyes
he
had
always
imagined
but
never
actually
seen
down
in
the
basement
it
an
animal
he
thought
incoherently
that
all
it
is
some
animal
maybe
a
housecat
that
got
stuck
down
in
there
still
he
was
ready
to
run
would
run
in
a
second
or
two
when
his
mental
switchboard
had
dealt
with
the
shock
those
two
shiny
yellow
eyes
had
given
him
he
felt
the
rough
surface
of
the
macadam
under
his
fingers
and
the
thin
sheet
of
cold
water
flowing
around
them
he
saw
himself
getting
up
and
backing
away
and
that
was
when
a
voice
a
perfectly
reasonable
and
rather
pleasant
voice
spoke
to
him
from
inside
the
stormdrain
hi
georgie
it
said
george
blinked
and
looked
again
he
could
barely
credit
what
he
saw
it
was
like
something
from
a
madeup
story
or
a
movie
where
you
know
the
animals
will
talk
and
dance
if
he
had
been
ten
years
older
he
would
not
have
believed
what
he
was
seeing
but
he
was
not
sixteen
he
was
six
there
was
a
clown
in
the
stormdrain
the
light
in
there
was
far
from
good
but
it
was
good
enough
so
that
george
denbrough
was
sure
of
what
he
was
seeing
it
was
a
clown
like
in
the
circus
or
on
tv
in
fact
he
looked
like
a
cross
between
bozo
and
clarabell
who
talked
by
honking
his
or
was
it
her
george
was
never
really
sure
of
the
gender
horn
on
howdy
doody
saturday
mornings
buffalo
bob
was
just
about
the
only
one
who
could
understand
clarabell
and
that
always
cracked
george
up
the
face
of
the
clown
in
the
stormdrain
was
white
there
were
funny
tufts
of
red
hair
on
either
side
of
his
bald
head
and
there
was
a
big
clownsmile
painted
over
his
mouth
if
george
had
been
inhabiting
a
later
year
he
would
have
surely
thought
of
ronald
mcdonald
before
bozo
or
chrabell
the
clown
held
a
bunch
of
balloons
all
colors
like
gorgeous
ripe
fruit
in
one
hand
in
the
other
he
held
george
newspaper
boat
want
your
boat
georgie
the
clown
smiled
george
smiled
back
he
couldn't
help
it
it
was
the
kind
of
smile
you
just
had
to
answer
sure
d
he
said
the
clown
laughed
i
sure
do
that
good
that
very
good
and
how
about
a
balloon
well
sure
he
reached
forward
and
then
drew
his
hand
reluctantly
back
i'm
not
supposed
to
take
stuff
from
strangers
my
dad
said
so
very
wise
of
your
dad
the
clown
in
the
stormdrain
said
smiling
how
george
wondered
could
i
have
thought
his
eyes
were
yellow
they
were
a
bright
dancing
blue
the
color
of
his
mom
eyes
and
bill
very
wise
indeed
therefore
i
will
introduce
myself
i
georgie

mr
bob
gray
also
known
as
pennywise
the
dancing
clown

george
denbrough

other
i'm
not
a
stranger
to
you
and
you're
not
a
stranger
to
me
keerect
george
giggled
i
guess
so
he
reached
forward
again
and
drew
his
hand
back
again
how
did
you
get
down
there
storm
just
bleeeew
me
away
pennywise
the
dancing
clown
said
it
blew
the
whole
circus
away
can
you
smell
the
circus
georgie
george
leaned
forward
suddenly
he
could
smell
peanuts
hot
roasted
peanuts
and
vinegar
the
white
kind
you
put
on
your
french
fries
through
a
hole
in
the
cap
he
could
smell
cotton
candy
and
frying
doughboys
and
the
faint
but
thunderous
odor
of
wildanimal
shit
he
could
smell
the
cheery
aroma
of
midway
sawdust
and
yet
and
yet
under
it
all
was
the
smell
of
flood
and
decomposing
leaves
and
dark
stormdrain
shadows
that
smell
was
wet
and
rotten
the
cellar
smell
but
the
other
smells
were
stronger
you
bet
i
can
smell
i
he
said
want
your
boat
georgie
pennywise
asked
i
only
repeat
myself
because
you
really
do
not
seem
that
eager
he
held
it
up
smiling
he
was
wearing
a
baggy
silk
suit
with
great
big
orange
buttons
a
bright
tie
electricblue
flopped
down
his
front
and
on
his
hands
were
big
white
gloves
like
the
kind
mickey
mouse
and
donald
duck
always
wore
yes
sure
george
said
looking
into
the
stormdrain
and
a
balloon
i've
got
red
and
green
and
yellow
and
blue
do
they
float
float
the
clown
grin
widened
oh
yes
indeed
they
do
they
float
and
there
cotton
candy
george
reached
the
clown
seized
his
arm
and
george
saw
the
clown
face
change
what
he
saw
then
was
terrible
enough
to
make
his
worst
imaginings
of
the
thing
in
the
cellar
look
like
sweet
dreams
what
he
saw
destroyed
his
sanity
in
one
clawing
stroke
they
float
the
thing
in
the
drain
crooned
n
a
clotted
chuckling
voice
it
held
george
arm
in
its
thick
and
wormy
grip
it
pulled
george
toward
that
terrible
darkness
where
the
water
rushed
and
roared
and
bellowed
as
it
bore
its
cargo
of
storm
debris
toward
the
sea
george
craned
his
neck
away
fom
that
final
blackness
and
began
to
scream
into
the
rain
to
scream
mindlessly
into
the
white
autumn
sky
which
curved
above
derry
on
that
day
in
the
fall
of
his
screams
were
shrill
and
piercing
and
all
up
and
down
witcham
street
people
came
to
then
windows
or
boiled
out
onto
their
porches
they
float
it
growled
they
float
georgie
and
when
you're
down
here
with
me
you'll
float
too
george
shoulder
socked
against
the
cement
of
the
curb
and
dave
gardener
who
had
stayed
home
from
his
job
at
the
shoeboat
that
day
because
of
the
flood
saw
only
a
small
boy
in
a
yellow
rainslicker
a
small
boy
who
was
screaming
and
writhing
in
the
gutter
with
muddy
water
surfing
over
his
face
and
making
his
screams
sound
bubbly
everything
down
here
floats
that
chuckling
rotten
voice
whispered
and
suddenly
there
was
a
ripping
noise
and
a
flaring
sheet
of
agony
and
george
denbrough
knew
no
more
dave
gardener
was
the
first
to
get
there
and
although
he
arrived
only
fortyfive
seconds
after
the
first
scream
george
denbrough
was
already
dead
gardener
grabbed
him
by
the
back
of
the
slicker
pulled
him
into
the
street
and
began
to
scream
himself
as
george
body
turned
over
in
his
hands
the
left
side
of
george
slicker
was
now
bright
red
blood
flowed
into
the
stormdrain
from
the
tattered
hole
where
the
left
arm
had
been
a
knob
of
bone
horribly
bright
peeked
through
the
torn
cloth
the
boy
eyes
stared
up
into
the
white
sky
and
as
dave
staggered
away
toward
the
others
already
running
pell
mell
down
the
street
they
began
to
fill
up
with
rain
somewhere
below
in
the
stormdrain
that
was
already
filled
nearly
to
capacity
with
runoff
there
could
have
been
no
one
down
there
the
county
sheriff
would
later
exclaim
to
a
derry
news
reporter
with
a
frustrated
fury
so
great
it
was
almost
agony
hercules
himself
would
have
been
swept
away
in
that
driving
current
george
newspaper
boat
shot
onward
through
nighted
chambers
and
long
concrete
hallways
that
roared
and
chimed
with
water
for
awhile
it
ran
neckandneck
with
a
dead
chicken
that
floated
with
its
yellowy
reptilian
toes
pointed
at
the
dripping
ceiling
then
at
some
junction
east
of
town
the
chicken
was
swept
off
to
the
left
while
george
boat
went
straight
an
hour
later
while
george
mother
was
being
sedated
in
the
emergency
room
at
derry
home
hospital
and
while
stuttering
bill
sat
stunned
and
white
and
silent
in
his
bed
listening
to
his
father
sob
hoarsely
in
the
parlor
where
his
mother
had
been
playing
fiir
elise
when
george
went
out
the
boat
shot
out
through
a
concrete
loophole
like
a
bullet
exiting
the
muzzle
of
a
gun
and
ran
at
speed
down
a
sluiceway
and
into
an
unnamed
stream
when
it
joined
the
boiling
swollen
penobscot
river
twenty
minutes
later
the
first
rifts
of
blue
had
begun
to
show
in
the
sky
overhead
the
storm
was
over
the
boat
dipped
and
swayed
and
sometimes
took
on
water
but
it
did
not
sink
the
two
brothers
had
waterproofed
it
well
i
do
not
know
where
it
finally
fetched
up
if
ever
it
did
perhaps
it
reached
the
sea
and
sails
there
forever
like
a
magic
boat
in
a
fairytale
all
i
know
is
that
it
was
still
afloat
and
still
running
on
the
breast
of
the
flood
when
it
passed
the
incorporated
town
limits
of
derry
maine
and
there
it
passes
out
of
this
tale
forever
chapter
after
the
festival
the
reason
adrian
was
wearing
the
hat
his
sobbing
boyfriend
would
later
tell
the
police
was
because
he
had
won
it
at
the
pitch
til
u
win
stall
on
the
bassey
park
fairgrounds
just
six
days
before
his
death
he
was
proud
of
it
he
was
wearing
it
because
he
loved
this
shitty
little
town
the
boyfriend
don
hagarty
screamed
at
the
cops
now
now
there
no
need
for
that
sort
of
language
officer
harold
gardener
told
hagarty
harold
gardener
was
one
of
dave
gardener
our
sons
on
the
day
his
father
had
discovered
the
lifeless
onearmed
body
of
george
denbrough
harold
gardener
had
been
five
on
this
day
almost
twentyseven
years
later
he
was
thirtytwo
and
balding
harold
gardener
recognized
the
reality
of
don
hagarty
grief
and
pain
and
at
the
same
time
found
it
impossible
to
take
seriously
this
man
if
you
want
to
call
him
a
man
was
wearing
lipstick
and
satin
pants
so
tight
you
could
almost
read
the
wrinkles
m
his
cock
grief
or
no
grief
pain
or
no
pain
he
was
after
all
just
a
queer
like
his
friend
the
late
adrian
mellon
let
go
through
it
again
harold
partner
jeffrey
reeves
said
the
two
of
you
came
out
of
the
falcon
and
turned
toward
the
canal
then
what
how
many
times
do
i
have
to
tell
you
idiots
hagarty
was
still
screaming
they
killed
him
they
pushed
him
over
the
side
just
another
day
in
macho
city
for
them
don
hagarty
began
to
cry
one
more
tim
reeves
repeated
patiently
you
came
out
of
the
falcon
then
what
in
an
interrogation
room
just
down
the
hall
two
derry
cops
were
speaking
with
steve
dubay
seventeen
in
the
clerk
of
probate
office
upstairs
two
more
were
questioning
john
webb
garton
eighteen
and
in
the
chief
of
police
office
on
the
fifth
floor
chief
andrew
rademacher
and
assistant
district
attorney
tom
boutillier
were
questioning
fifteenyearold
christopher
unwin
unwin
who
wore
faded
jeans
a
greasesmeared
teeshirt
and
blocky
engineer
boots
was
weeping
rademacher
and
boutillier
had
taken
him
because
they
had
quite
accurately
assessed
him
as
the
weak
link
in
the
chain
let
go
through
it
again
boutillier
said
in
this
office
just
as
jeffrey
reeves
was
saying
the
same
thing
two
floors
down
we
didn't
mean
to
kill
him
unwin
blubbered
it
was
the
hat
we
couldn't
believe
he
was
still
wearing
the
hat
after
you
know
after
what
webby
said
the
first
time
and
i
guess
we
wanted
to
scare
him
for
what
he
said
chief
rademacher
interjected
yes
to
john
garton
on
the
afternoon
of
the
th
yes
to
webby
unwin
burst
into
fresh
tears
but
we
tried
to
save
him
when
we
saw
he
was
in
trouble
at
least
me
and
stevie
dubay
did
we
didn't
mean
to
kill
him
come
on
chris
don't
shit
us
boutillier
said
you
threw
the
little
queer
into
the
canal
yes
but
and
the
three
of
you
came
in
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
things
chief
rademacher
and
i
appreciate
that
don't
we
andy
you
bet
it
takes
a
man
to
own
up
to
what
he
did
chris
so
don't
fuck
yourself
up
by
lying
now
you
meant
to
throw
him
over
the
minute
you
saw
him
and
his
fag
buddy
coming
out
of
the
falcon
didn't
you
n
chris
unwin
protested
vehemently
boutillier
took
a
pack
of
marlboros
from
his
shirt
pocket
and
stuck
one
in
his
mouth
he
offered
the
pack
to
unwin
cigarette
unwin
took
one
boutillier
had
to
chase
the
tip
with
a
match
in
order
to
give
him
a
light
because
of
the
way
unwin
mouth
was
trembling
but
when
you
saw
he
was
wearing
the
hat
rademacher
asked
unwin
dragged
deep
lowered
his
head
so
that
his
greasy
hair
fell
in
his
eyes
and
jetted
smoke
from
his
nose
which
was
littered
with
blackheads
yea
he
said
almost
too
softly
to
be
heard
boutillier
leaned
forward
brown
eyes
gleaming
his
face
was
predatory
but
his
voice
was
gentle
what
chris
said
yes
i
guess
so
to
throw
him
in
but
not
to
kill
him
he
looked
up
at
them
face
frantic
and
miserable
and
still
unable
to
comprehend
the
stupendous
changes
which
had
taken
place
in
his
life
since
he
left
the
house
to
take
in
the
last
night
of
derry
canal
days
festival
with
two
of
his
buddies
at
seventhirty
the
previous
evening
not
to
kill
him
he
repeated
and
that
guy
under
the
bridge
i
still
don't
know
who
he
was
what
guy
was
that
rademacher
asked
but
without
much
interest
they
had
heard
this
part
before
as
well
and
neither
of
them
believed
it
sooner
or
later
men
accused
of
murder
almost
always
drag
out
that
mysterious
other
guy
boutillier
even
had
a
name
for
it
he
called
it
the
onearmed
man
syndrome
after
that
old
tv
series
the
fugitive
the
guy
in
the
clown
sui
chris
unwin
said
and
shivered
the
guy
with
the
balloons
the
canal
days
festival
which
ran
from
july
th
to
july
st
had
been
a
rousing
success
most
derry
residents
agreed
a
great
thing
for
the
city
morale
image
and
pocketbook
the
weeklong
festival
was
pegged
to
mark
the
centenary
of
the
opening
of
the
canal
which
ran
through
the
middle
of
downtown
it
had
been
the
canal
which
had
fully
opened
derry
to
the
lumber
trade
in
the
years
to
it
had
been
the
canal
which
had
birthed
derry
boom
years
the
town
was
spruced
up
from
east
to
west
and
north
to
south
potholes
which
some
residents
swore
hadn't
been
patched
for
ten
years
or
more
were
neatly
filled
with
hottop
and
rolled
smooth
the
town
buildings
were
refurbished
on
the
inside
repainted
on
the
outside
the
worst
of
the
graffiti
in
bassey
park
much
of
it
coolly
logical
antigay
statements
such
as
kill
all
queers
and
aids
from
god
you
hellhound
homos
was
sanded
off
the
benches
and
wooden
walls
of
the
little
covered
walkway
over
the
canal
known
as
the
kissing
bridge
a
canal
days
museum
was
installed
in
three
empty
storefronts
downtown
and
filled
with
exhibits
by
michael
hanlon
a
local
librarian
and
amateur
historian
the
town
oldest
families
loaned
freely
of
their
almost
priceless
treasures
and
during
the
week
of
the
festival
nearly
forty
thousand
visitors
paid
a
quarter
each
to
look
at
eatinghouse
menus
from
the
s
logger
bitts
axes
and
peaveys
from
the
s
children
toys
from
the
s
and
over
two
thousand
photographs
and
nine
reels
of
movie
film
of
life
as
it
had
been
in
derry
over
the
last
hundred
years
the
museum
was
sponsored
by
the
derry
ladie
society
which
vetoed
some
of
hanlon
proposed
exhibits
such
as
the
notorious
trampchair
from
the
s
and
photographs
such
as
those
of
the
bradley
gang
after
the
notorious
shootout
but
all
agreed
it
was
a
great
success
and
no
one
really
wanted
to
see
those
gory
old
things
anyway
it
was
so
much
better
to
accentuate
the
positive
and
eliminate
the
negative
as
the
old
song
said
there
was
a
huge
striped
refreshment
tent
in
derry
park
and
band
concerts
there
every
night
in
bassey
park
there
was
a
carnival
with
rides
by
smokey
greater
shows
and
games
run
by
local
townfolk
a
special
tramcar
circled
the
historic
sections
of
the
town
every
hour
on
the
hour
and
ended
up
at
this
gaudy
and
amiable
money
machine
it
was
here
that
adrian
mellon
won
the
hat
which
would
get
him
killed
the
paper
tophat
with
the
flower
and
the
band
which
said
y
derry
tm
tired
john
webb
garton
said
like
his
two
friends
he
was
dressed
in
unconscious
imitation
of
bruce
springsteen
although
if
asked
he
would
probably
call
springsteen
a
wimp
or
a
fagola
and
would
instead
profess
admiration
for
such
bitchin
heavymetal
groups
as
def
leppard
twisted
sister
or
judas
priest
the
sleeves
of
his
plain
blue
teeshirt
were
torn
off
showing
his
heavily
muscled
arms
his
thick
brown
hair
fell
over
one
eye
this
touch
was
more
john
cougar
mellencamp
than
springsteen
there
were
blue
tattoos
on
his
arms
arcane
symbols
which
looked
as
if
they
had
been
drawn
by
a
child
i
don't
want
to
talk
no
more
just
tell
us
about
tuesday
afternoon
at
the
fair
paul
hughes
said
hughes
was
tired
and
shocked
and
dismayed
by
this
whole
sordid
business
he
thought
again
and
again
that
it
was
as
if
derry
canal
days
ended
with
one
final
event
which
everyone
had
somehow
known
about
but
which
no
one
had
quite
dared
to
put
down
on
the
daily
program
of
events
if
they
had
it
would
have
looked
like
this
saturday
p.m
final
band
concert
featuring
the
derry
high
school
band
and
the
barber
shop
mello
men
saturday
p.m
giant
fireworks
show
saturday
p.m
ritual
sacrifice
of
adrian
mellon
officially
ends
canal
days
fuck
the
fair
webby
replied
just
what
you
said
to
mellon
and
what
he
said
to
you
oh
christ
webby
rolled
his
eyes
come
on
webby
hughes
partner
said
webby
garton
rolled
his
eyes
and
began
again
garton
saw
the
two
of
them
mellon
and
hagarty
mincing
along
with
their
arms
about
each
other
waists
and
giggling
like
a
couple
of
girls
at
first
he
actually
thought
they
were
a
couple
of
girls
then
he
recognized
mellon
who
had
been
pointed
out
to
him
before
as
he
looked
he
saw
mellon
turn
to
hagarty
and
they
kissed
briefly
oh
man
i'm
gonna
bar
webby
cried
disgusted
chris
unwin
and
steve
dubay
were
with
him
when
webby
pointed
out
mellon
steve
dubay
said
he
thought
the
other
fag
was
named
don
somebody
and
that
he'd
picked
up
a
kid
from
derry
high
hitching
and
then
tried
to
put
a
few
moves
on
him
mellon
and
hagarty
began
to
move
toward
the
three
boys
again
walking
away
from
the
pitch
til
u
win
and
toward
the
camy
exit
webby
garton
would
later
tell
officers
hughes
and
conley
that
his
civic
pride
had
been
wounded
by
seeing
a
fucking
faggot
wearing
a
hat
which
said
y
derry
it
was
a
silly
thing
that
hat
a
paper
imitation
of
a
top
hat
with
a
great
big
flower
sticking
up
from
the
top
and
nodding
about
in
every
direction
the
silliness
of
the
hat
apparently
wounded
webby
civic
pride
even
more
as
mellon
and
hagarty
passed
each
with
his
arm
linked
about
the
other
waist
webby
garton
yelled
out
i
ought
to
make
you
eat
that
hat
you
fucking
ass
bandit
mellon
turned
toward
garton
fluttered
his
eyes
flirtatiously
and
said
if
you
want
something
to
eat
hon
i
can
find
something
much
tastier
than
my
hat
at
this
point
webby
garton
decided
le
was
going
to
rearrange
the
faggot
face
in
the
geography
of
mellon
face
mountains
would
rise
and
continents
would
drift
nobody
suggested
he
sucked
the
root
nobody
he
started
toward
mellon
mellon
friend
hagarty
alarmed
attempted
to
pull
mellon
away
but
mellon
stood
his
ground
smiling
garton
would
later
tell
officers
hughes
and
conley
that
he
was
pretty
sure
mellon
was
high
on
something
so
he
was
hagarty
would
agree
when
this
idea
was
passed
on
to
him
by
officers
gardener
and
reeves
he
was
high
on
two
fried
doughboys
smeared
with
honey
on
the
carnival
on
the
whole
day
he
had
been
consequently
unable
to
recognize
the
real
menace
which
webby
garton
represented
but
that
was
adrian
don
said
using
a
tissue
to
wipe
his
eyes
and
smearing
the
spangled
eyeshadow
he
was
wearing
he
didn't
have
much
in
the
way
of
protective
coloration
he
was
one
of
those
fools
who
think
things
really
are
going
to
turn
out
all
right
he
might
have
been
badly
hurt
there
and
then
if
garton
hadn't
felt
something
tap
his
elbow
it
was
a
nightstick
he
turned
his
head
to
see
officer
frank
machen
another
member
of
derry
finest
never
mind
little
buddy
machen
told
garton
mind
your
business
and
leave
those
little
gay
boyos
alone
have
some
fun
did
you
hear
what
he
called
me
garton
asked
body
he
was
now
joined
by
unwin
and
dubay
the
two
of
them
smelling
trouble
tried
to
urge
garton
on
up
the
midway
but
garton
shrugged
them
away
would
have
turned
on
them
with
his
fists
if
they
had
persisted
his
masculinity
had
borne
an
insult
which
he
felt
must
be
avenged
nobody
suggested
he
sucked
the
root
nobody
don't
believe
he
called
you
anything
machen
replied
and
you
spoke
to
him
first
i
believe
now
move
on
sonny
i
don't
want
to
have
to
tell
you
again
he
called
me
a
queer
are
you
worried
you
might
be
then
machen
asked
seeming
to
be
honestly
interested
and
garton
flushed
a
deep
ugly
red
during
this
exchange
hagarty
was
trying
with
increasing
desperation
to
pull
adrian
mellon
away
from
the
scene
now
at
last
mellon
was
going
tata
love
adrian
called
cheekily
over
his
shoulder
shut
up
candyas
machen
said
get
out
of
here
garton
made
a
lunge
at
mellon
and
machen
grabbed
him
i
can
run
you
in
my
friend
machen
said
and
the

after

that
hat

gonna
kill

town

faggots

yo
without
turning
mellon
waggled
the
fingers
of
his
left
hand
the
nails
were
painted
cerise
and
put
an
extra
little
wiggle
in
his
walk
garton
lunged
again
one
more
word
or

more

and
in

steve
dubay
said
quietly
let
go
get
some
hot
dogs
webby
went
straightening
his
shirt
with
exaggerated
moves
and
brushing
the
hair
out
of
his
eyes
machen
who
also
gave
a
statement
on
the
morning
following
adrian
mellon
death
said
the
last
thing
i
heard
him
say
as
him
and
his
buddies
walked
off
was
next
time
i
see
him
he
going
to
be
in
serious
hurt
please
i
got
to
talk
to
my
mother
steve
dubay
said
for
the
third
time
tve
got
to
get
her
to
mellow
out
my
stepfather
or
there
is
going
to
be
one
hell
of
a
punchingmatch
when
i
get
home
tn
a
little
while
officer
charles
avarino
told
him
both
avarino
and
his
partner
barney
morrison
knew
that
steve
dubay
would
not
be
going
home
tonight
and
maybe
not
for
many
nights
to
come
the
boy
did
not
seem
b
realize
just
how
heavy
this
particular
bust
was
and
avarino
would
not
be
surprised
when
he
learned
later
on
that
dubay
had
left
school
at
age
sixteen
at
that
time
he
had
still
been
in
water
street
junior
high
his
iq
was
according
to
the
wechsler
he
had
taken
during
one
of
his
three
trips
through
the
seventh
grade
tell
us
what
happened
when
you
saw
mellon
coming
out
of
the
falcon
morrison
invited
no
man
i
better
not
well
why
not
avarino
asked
i
already
talked
too
much
maybe
you
came
in
to
talk
avarino
said
isn't
that
right
well
yeah
but
listen
morrison
said
warmly
sitting
down
next
to
dubay
and
shooting
him
a
cigarette
you
think
me
and
chick
here
like
fags
i
don't
know
do
we
look
like
we
like
fags
no
but
we're
your
friends
steveo
morrison
said
solemnly
and
believe
me
you
and
chris
and
webby
need
all
the
friends
you
can
get
just
about
now
because
tomorrow
every
bleeding
heart
in
this
town
is
going
to
be
screaming
for
you
guys
blood
steve
dubay
looked
dimly
alarmed
avarino
who
could
almost
read
this
hairbag
pussy
little
mind
suspected
he
was
thinking
about
his
stepfather
again
and
although
avarino
had
no
liking
for
derry
small
gay
community
like
every
other
cop
on
the
force
he
would
enjoy
seeing
the
falcon
shut
up
forever
he
would
have
been
delighted
to
drive
dubay
home
himself
he
would
in
fact
have
been
delighted
to
hold
dubay
arms
while
dubay
stepfather
beat
the
creep
to
oatmeal
avarino
did
not
like
gays
but
this
did
not
mean
he
believed
they
should
be
tortured
and
murdered
mellon
had
been
savaged
when
they
brought
him
up
from
under
the
canal
bridge
his
eyes
had
been
open
bulging
with
terror
and
this
guy
here
had
absolutely
no
idea
of
what
he
had
helped
do
we
didn't
mean
to
hurt
im
steve
repeated
this
was
his
fallback
position
when
he
became
even
slightly
confused
that
why
you
want
to
get
out
front
with
us
avarino
said
earnestly
get
the
true
facts
of
the
matter
out
in
front
and
this
maybe
won't
amount
to
a
pisshole
in
the
snow
isn't
that
right
barney
as
rain
morrison
agreed
one
more
time
what
do
you
sa
avarino
coaxed
well
steve
said
and
then
slowly
began
to
talk
when
the
falcon
was
opened
in
elmer
curtie
thought
his
clientele
would
consist
mostly
of
busriders
the
terminal
next
door
serviced
three
different
lines
trailways
greyhound
and
aroostook
county
what
he
failed
to
realize
was
how
many
of
the
passengers
who
ride
buses
are
women
or
families
with
small
children
in
tow
many
of
the
others
kept
their
bottles
in
brown
bags
and
never
got
off
the
bus
at
all
those
who
did
were
usually
soldiers
or
sailors
who
wanted
no
more
than
a
quick
beer
or
two
you
couldn't
very
well
go
on
a
bender
during
a
ten
minute
rest
stop
curtie
had
begun
to
realize
some
of
these
home
truths
by
but
by
then
it
was
too
late
he
was
up
to
his
tits
in
bills
and
there
was
no
way
that
he
œuld
see
out
of
the
red
ink
the
idea
of
burning
the
place
down
for
the
insurance
occurred
to
him
but
unless
he
hired
a
professional
to
torch
it
he
supposed
he
would
be
caught
and
he
had
no
idea
where
professional
arsonists
hung
out
anyway
he
decided
in
february
of
that
year
that
he
would
give
it
until
july
th
if
things
didn't
look
as
if
they
were
turning
around
by
then
he
would
simply
walk
next
door
get
on
a
hound
and
see
how
things
looked
down
in
florida
but
in
the
next
five
months
an
amazing
quiet
sort
of
prosperity
came
to
the
bar
which
was
painted
black
and
gold
inside
and
decorated
with
stuffed
birds
elmer
curtie
brother
had
been
an
amateur
taxidermist
who
specialized
in
birds
and
elmer
had
inherited
the
stuff
when
he
died
suddenly
instead
of
drawing
sixty
beers
and
pouring
maybe
twenty
drinks
a
night
elmer
was
drawing
eighty
beers
and
pouring
a
hundred
drinks
a
hundred
and
twenty
sometimes
a
hundred
and
sixty
his
clientele
was
young
polite
almost
exclusively
male
many
of
them
dressed
outrageously
but
those
were
years
when
outrageous
dress
was
still
almost
the
norm
and
elmer
curtie
did
not
realize
that
his
patrons
were
just
about
almost
exclusively
gay
until
or
so
if
derry
residents
had
heard
him
say
this
they
would
have
laughed
and
said
that
elmer
curtie
must
think
they
had
all
been
born
yesterday
but
his
claim
was
perfectly
true
like
the
man
with
the
cheating
wife
he
was
practically
the
last
to
know
and
by
the
time
he
did
he
didn't
care
the
bar
was
making
money
and
while
there
were
four
other
bars
in
derry
which
turned
a
profit
the
falcon
was
the
only
one
where
rambunctious
patrons
did
not
regularly
demolish
the
whole
place
there
were
no
women
to
fight
over
for
one
thing
and
these
men
fags
or
not
seemed
to
have
learned
a
secret
of
getting
along
with
each
other
which
their
heterosexual
counterparts
did
not
know
once
he
became
aware
of
the
sexual
preference
of
his
regulars
he
seemed
to
hear
lurid
stories
about
the
falcon
everywhere
these
stories
had
been
circulating
for
years
but
until
curtie
simply
hadn't
heard
them
the
most
enthusiastic
tellers
of
these
tales
he
came
to
realize
were
men
who
wouldn't
be
dragged
into
the
falcon
with
a
chainfall
for
fear
all
the
muscles
would
go
out
of
their
wrists
or
something
yet
they
seemed
privy
to
all
sorts
of
information
according
to
the
stories
you
could
go
in
there
any
night
and
see
men
closedancing
rubbing
their
cocks
together
right
out
on
the
dancefloor
men
fenchkissing
at
the
bar
men
getting
blow
jobs
in
the
bathrooms
there
was
supposedly
a
room
out
back
where
you
went
if
you
wanted
to
spend
a
little
time
on
the
tower
of
power
there
was
a
big
old
fellow
in
a
nazi
uniform
back
there
who
kept
his
arm
greased
most
of
the
way
to
the
shoulder
and
who
would
be
happy
to
take
care
of
you
in
fact
none
of
these
things
was
true
when
folks
with
a
thirst
did
come
in
from
the
bus
station
for
a
beer
or
a
highball
they
sensed
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
in
the
falcon
at
all
there
were
a
lot
of
guys
sure
but
that
was
no
different
from
thousands
of
workingmen
bars
all
across
the
country
the
clientele
was
gay
but
gay
was
not
a
synonym
for
stupid
if
they
wanted
a
little
outrageousness
they
went
to
portland
if
they
wanted
a
lot
of
outrageousness
ramrodstyle
outrageousness
or
peck
big
boystyle
outrageousness
they
went
down
to
new
york
or
boston
derry
was
small
derry
was
provincial
and
derry
small
gay
community
understood
the
shadow
under
which
it
existed
quite
well
don
hagarty
had
been
coming
into
the
falcon
for
two
or
three
years
on
the
night
in
march
of
when
he
first
showed
up
with
adrian
mellon
before
then
hagarty
had
been
the
sort
who
plays
the
field
rarely
showing
up
with
the
same
escort
half
a
dozen
times
but
by
late
april
it
had
become
obvious
even
to
elmer
curtie
who
cared
very
little
about
such
things
that
hagarty
and
mellon
had
a
steady
thing
going
hagarty
was
a
draftsman
with
an
engineering
firm
in
bangor
adrian
melon
was
a
freelance
writer
who
published
anywhere
and
everywhere
he
could
airline
magazines
confession
magazines
regional
magazines
sunday
supplements
sexletter
magazines
he
had
been
working
on
a
novel
but
maybe
that
wasn't
serious
he
had
been
working
on
it
since
his
third
year
of
college
and
that
had
been
twelve
years
ago
he
had
come
to
derry
to
write
a
piece
about
the
canal
he
was
on
assignment
from
new
england
byways
a
glossy
bimonthly
that
was
published
in
concord
adrian
mellon
had
taken
the
assignment
because
he
could
squeeze
byways
for
three
week
worth
of
expense
money
including
a
nice
room
at
the
derry
town
house
and
gather
all
the
material
he
needed
for
the
piece
in
maybe
five
days
during
the
other
two
weeks
he
could
gather
enough
material
for
maybe
four
other
regional
pieces
but
during
that
threeweek
period
he
met
don
hagarty
and
instead
of
going
back
to
portland
when
his
three
weeks
on
the
cuff
were
over
he
found
himself
a
small
apartment
on
kossuth
lane
he
lived
there
for
only
six
weeks
then
he
moved
in
with
don
hagarty
that
summer
hagarty
told
harold
gardener
and
jeff
reeves
was
the
happiest
summer
of
his
life
he
should
have
been
on
the
lookout
he
said
he
should
have
known
that
god
only
puts
a
rug
under
guys
like
him
in
order
to
jerk
it
out
from
under
their
feet
the
only
shadow
he
said
was
adrian
extravagantly
partisan
reaction
to
derry
he
had
a
teeshirt
which
said
maine
ain't
bad
but
derry
great
he
had
a
derry
tigers
highschool
jacket
and
of
course
there
was
the
hat
he
claimed
to
find
the
atmosphere
vital
and
creatively
invigorating
perhaps
there
was
something
to
this
he
had
taken
his
languishing
novel
out
of
the
trunk
for
the
first
time
in
nearly
a
year
was
he
really
working
on
it
then
gardener
asked
hagarty
not
really
caring
but
wanting
to
keep
hagarty
primed
yes
he
was
busting
pages
he
said
it
might
be
a
terrible
novel
but
it
was
no
longer
going
to
be
a
terrible
unfinished
novel
he
expected
to
finish
it
by
hs
birthday
in
october
of
course
he
didn't
know
what
derry
was
really
like
he
thought
he
did
but
he
hadn't
been
here
long
enough
to
get
a
whiff
of
the
real
derry
i
kept
trying
to
tell
him
but
he
wouldn't
listen
and
what
derry
really
like
do
reeves
asked
tt
a
lot
like
a
dead
strumpet
with
maggots
squirming
out
of
her
cooz
don
hagarty
said
the
two
cops
stared
in
silent
amazement
it
a
bad
plac
hagarty
said
it
a
sewer
you
mean
you
two
guys
don't
know
that
you
two
guys
have
lived
here
all
of
your
lives
and
you
don't
know
that
neither
of
them
answered
after
a
little
while
hagarty
went
on
until
adrian
mellon
entered
his
life
don
had
been
planning
to
leave
derry
he
had
been
there
for
three
years
mostly
because
he
had
agreed
to
a
longterm
lease
on
an
apartment
with
the
world
most
fantastic
river
view
but
now
the
lease
was
almost
up
and
don
was
glad
no
more
long
commute
back
and
forth
to
bangor
no
more
weird
vibes
in
derry
he
once
told
adrian
it
always
felt
like
thirteen
o'clock
adrian
might
think
derry
was
a
great
place
but
it
scared
don
it
was
not
just
the
town
tightly
homophobic
attitude
an
attitude
as
clearly
expressed
by
the
town
preachers
as
by
the
graffiti
in
bassey
park
but
that
was
one
thing
he
had
been
able
to
put
his
finger
on
adrian
had
laughed
don
every
town
in
america
has
a
contingent
that
hates
the
gayfol
he
said
don't
tell
me
you
don't
know
that
this
is
after
all
the
era
of
ronnie
moron
and
phyllis
hous
efly
come
down
to
bassey
park
with
me
don
had
replied
after
seeing
that
adrian
really
meant
what
he
was
saying
and
what
he
was
really
saying
was
that
derry
was
no
worse
than
any
other
fairsized
town
in
the
hinterlands
i
want
to
show
you
something
my
love
they
drove
to
bassey
park
this
had
been
in
midjune
about
a
month
before
adrian
murder
hagarty
told
the
cops
he
took
adrian
into
the
dark
vaguely
unpleasantsmelling
shadows
of
the
kissing
bridge
he
pointed
out
one
of
the
graffiti
adrian
had
to
strike
a
match
and
hold
it
below
the
writing
in
order
to
read
it
show
me
your
cock
queer
and
i'll
cut
it
off
you
i
know
how
people
feel
about
gays
don
said
quietly
i
got
beaten
up
at
a
truckstop
in
dayton
when
i
was
a
teenager
some
fellows
in
portland
set
my
shoes
on
fire
outside
of
a
sandwich
shop
while
this
fatassed
old
cop
sat
inside
his
cruiser
and
laughed
i've
seen
a
lot
but
i've
never
seen
anything
quite
like
this
look
over
here
check
it
out
another
match
revealed
stick
nails
in
eyes
of
all
fagots
for
god
whoever
writes
these
little
homilies
has
got
a
case
of
the
deepdown
crazies
i'd
feel
better
if
i
thought
it
was
just
one
person
one
isolated
sickie
but
don
swept
his
arm
vaguely
down
the
length
of
the
kissing
bridge
there
a
lot
of
this
stuff
and
i
just
don't
think
one
person
did
it
all
that
why
i
want
to
leave
derry
ade
too
many
places
and
too
many
people
seem
to
have
the
deep
down
crazies
well
wait
until
i
finish
my
novel
okay
please
october
i
promise
no
later
the
air
better
here
he
didn't
know
it
was
the
water
he
was
going
to
have
to
watch
out
for
don
hagarty
said
bitterly
tom
boutillier
and
chief
rademacher
leaned
forward
neither
of
them
speaking
chris
unwin
sat
with
his
head
down
talking
monotonously
to
the
floor
this
was
the
part
they
wanted
to
hear
this
was
the
part
that
was
going
to
send
at
least
two
of
these
assholes
to
thomaston
the
fair
wasn't
no
good
unwin
said
they
was
already
takin
down
all
the
bitchin
rides
you
know
like
the
devil
dish
and
the
parachute
drop
they
already
had
a
sign
on
the
bumper
cars
that
said
closed
wasn't
nothing
open
but
baby
rides
so
we
went
down
by
the
games
and
webby
saw
the
pitch
til
u
win
and
he
paid
fifty
cents
and
he
seen
that
hat
the
queer
was
wearing
and
he
pitched
at
that
but
he
kept
missing
it
and
every
time
he
missed
he
got
more
in
a
bad
mood
you
know
and
steve
he
the
guy
who
usually
goes
around
saying
mellow
out
like
mellow
out
this
and
mellow
out
that
and
why
don't
you
fuckin
mellow
out
you
know
only
he
was
in
a
real
pissuparope
mood
because
he
took
this
pill
you
know
i
don't
know
what
kind
of
a
pill
a
red
pill
maybe
it
was
even
legal
but
he
keeps
after
webby
until
i
thought
webby
was
gonna
hit
him
you
know
he
goes
you
can't
even
win
that
queer
hat
you
must
be
really
wasted
if
you
can't
even
win
that
queer
hat
so
finally
the
lady
gives
im
a
prize
even
though
the
ring
wasn't
over
it
cause
i
think
she
wanted
to
get
rid
of
us
i
don't
know
maybe
she
didn't
but
i
think
she
did
it
was
this
noisemaker
thing
you
know
you
blow
it
and
it
puffs
up
and
unrolls
and
makes
a
noise
like
a
fart
you
know
i
used
to
have
one
of
those
i
got
it
for
halloween
or
new
year
or
some
fuckin
holiday
i
thought
it
was
pretty
good
only
i
lost
it
or
maybe
somebody
hawked
it
out
of
my
pocket
in
the
fuckin
playyard
at
school
you
know
so
then
the
fair
closin
and
we're
walkin
out
and
steve
still
on
webby
about
not
bein
able
to
win
that
queer
hat
you
know
and
webby
ain't
sayin
much
and
i
know
that
a
bad
sign
but
i
was
pretty
faced
you
know
so
i
knew
i
ought
to
like
change
the
subject
only
i
couldn't
think
of
no
subject
you
know
so
when
we
get
into
the
parkin
lot
steve
says
where
you
want
to
go
home
and
webby
goes
let
cruise
by
the
falcon
first
and
see
if
that
queer
around
boutillier
and
rademacher
exchanged
a
glance
boutillier
raised
a
single
finger
and
tapped
it
against
his
cheek
although
this
doofus
in
the
engineer
boots
didn't
know
it
he
was
now
talking
about
first
degree
murder
so
i
goes
no
i
gotta
get
home
and
webby
goes
you
scared
to
go
by
that
queerbar
and
i
go
fuck
no
and
steve
still
high
or
something
and
he
says
let
go
grease
some
queermeat
let
go
grease
some
queermeat
let
go
grease
the
timing
was
just
right
enough
so
that
things
worked
out
wrong
for
everyone
adrian
mellon
and
don
hagarty
came
out
of
the
falcon
after
two
beers
walked
up
past
the
bus
station
and
then
linked
hands
neither
of
them
thought
about
it
it
was
just
something
they
did
it
was
tentwenty
they
reached
the
corner
and
turned
left
the
kissing
bridge
was
almost
half
a
mile
upriver
from
here
they
meant
to
cross
main
street
bridge
which
was
much
less
picturesque
the
kenduskeag
was
summerlow
no
more
than
four
feet
of
water
sliding
listlessly
around
the
concrete
pilings
when
the
duster
drew
abreast
of
them
steve
dubay
had
spotted
the
two
of
them
coming
out
of
the
falcon
and
gleefully
pointed
them
out
they
were
on
the
edge
of
the
span
cut
in
cut
in
webby
garton
screamed
the
two
men
had
just
passed
under
a
streetlight
and
he
had
spotted
the
fact
that
they
were
holding
hands
this
infuriated
him
but
not
as
much
as
the
hat
infuriated
him
the
big
paper
flower
was
nodding
crazily
this
way
and
that
cut
in
goddammi
and
steve
did
chris
unwin
would
deny
active
participation
in
what
followed
but
don
hagarty
told
a
different
story
he
said
that
garton
was
out
of
the
car
almost
before
it
stopped
and
that
the
other
two
quickly
followed
there
was
talk
not
good
talk
there
was
no
attempt
at
flippancy
or
false
coquetry
on
adrian
part
this
night
he
recognized
that
they
were
in
a
lot
of
trouble
give
me
that
hat
garton
said
give
it
to
me
queer
if
i
do
will
you
leave
us
alone
adrian
was
wheezing
with
fright
almost
crying
looking
from
unwin
to
dubay
to
garton
with
terrified
eyes
just
give
me
the
fucker
adrian
handed
it
over
garton
produced
a
switchknife
from
the
left
front
pocket
of
his
jeans
and
cut
it
into
two
pieces
he
rubbed
the
pieces
against
the
seat
of
his
jeans
then
he
dropped
them
to
his
feet
and
stomped
them
don
hagarty
backed
away
a
little
while
their
attention
was
divided
between
adrian
and
the
hat
he
was
looking
he
said
for
a
cop
now
will
you
let
us
al
adrian
mellon
began
and
that
was
when
garton
punched
him
in
the
face
driving
him
back
against
the
waisthigh
pedestrian
railing
of
the
bridge
adrian
screamed
clapping
his
hands
to
his
mouth
blood
poured
through
his
fingers
ade
hagarty
cried
and
ran
forward
again
dubay
tripped
him
garton
booted
him
in
the
stomach
knocking
him
off
the
sidewalk
and
into
the
roadway
a
car
passed
hagarty
rose
to
his
knees
and
screamed
at
it
it
didn't
slow
the
driver
he
told
gardener
and
reeves
never
even
looked
around
shut
up
queer
dubay
said
and
kicked
him
in
the
side
of
the
face
hagarty
fell
on
his
side
in
the
gutter
semiconscious
a
few
moments
later
he
heard
a
voice
chris
unwin
telling
him
to
get
away
before
he
got
what
his
friend
was
getting
in
his
own
statement
unwin
verified
giving
this
warning
hagarty
could
hear
thudding
blows
and
the
sound
of
his
lover
screaming
adrian
sounded
like
a
rabbit
in
a
snare
he
told
the
police
hagarty
crawled
back
toward
the
intersection
and
the
bright
lights
of
the
bus
station
and
when
he
was
a
distance
away
he
turned
back
to
look
adrian
mellon
who
stood
about
fivefive
and
might
have
weighed
a
hundred
and
thirty
five
pounds
soaking
wet
was
being
pushed
from
garton
to
dubay
to
unwin
in
a
kind
of
triple
play
his
body
jittered
and
flopped
like
the
body
of
a
rag
doll
they
were
punching
him
pummelling
him
ripping
at
his
clothes
as
he
watched
he
said
garton
punched
adrian
in
the
crotch
adrian
hair
hung
in
his
face
blood
poured
out
of
his
mouth
and
soaked
his
shirt
webby
garton
wore
two
heavy
rings
on
his
right
hand
one
was
a
derry
high
school
ring
the
other
one
he
had
made
in
shop
class
an
intertwined
brass
db
stood
out
three
inches
from
this
latter
the
letters
stood
for
the
dead
bugs
a
metal
band
he
particularly
admired
the
rings
had
torn
adrian
upper
lip
open
and
shattered
three
of
his
upper
teeth
at
the
gum
line
hel
hagarty
shrieked
help
help
they're
killing
him
hel
the
buildings
of
main
street
loomed
dark
and
secret
no
one
came
to
help
not
even
from
the
one
white
island
of
light
which
marked
the
bus
station
and
hagarty
did
not
see
how
that
could
be
there
were
people
in
there
he
had
seen
them
when
he
and
ade
walked
past
would
none
of
them
come
to
help
none
at
all
help
help
they're
killing
him
help
please
for
god
sak
help
a
very
small
voice
whispered
from
don
hagarty
left
and
then
there
was
a
giggle
bum
rus
garton
was
yelling
now
yelling
and
laughing
all
three
of
them
hagarty
told
gardener
and
reeves
had
been
laughing
while
they
beat
adrian
up
bum
rush
over
the
side
bum
rush
bum
rush
bum
rush
dubay
chanted
laughing
help
the
small
voice
said
again
and
although
the
voice
was
grave
that
little
giggle
followed
again
it
was
like
the
voice
of
a
child
who
cannot
help
itself
hagarty
looked
down
and
saw
the
clown
and
it
was
at
this
point
that
gardener
and
reeves
began
to
discount
everything
that
hagarty
said
because
the
rest
was
the
raving
of
a
lunatic
later
however
harold
gardener
found
himself
wondering
later
when
he
found
that
the
unwin
boy
had
also
seen
a
clown
or
said
he
had
he
began
to
have
second
thoughts
his
partner
either
never
had
them
or
would
never
admit
to
them
the
clown
hagarty
said
looked
like
a
cross
between
ronald
mcdonald
and
that
old
tv
clown
bozo
or
so
he
thought
at
first
it
was
the
wild
tufts
of
orange
hair
that
brought
such
comparisons
to
mind
but
later
consideration
had
caused
him
to
think
the
clown
really
looked
like
neither
the
smile
painted
over
the
white
pancake
was
red
not
orange
and
the
eyes
were
a
weird
shiny
silver
contact
lenses
perhaps
but
a
part
of
him
thought
then
and
continued
to
think
that
maybe
that
silver
had
been
the
real
color
of
those
eyes
he
wore
a
baggy
suit
with
big
orangepompom
buttons
on
his
hands
were
cartoon
gloves
if
you
need
help
don
the
clown
said
help
yourself
to
a
balloon
and
it
offered
the
bunch
it
held
in
one
hand
they
float
the
clown
said
down
here
we
all
float
pretty
soon
your
friend
will
float
too
this
clown
called
you
by
name
jeff
reeves
said
in
a
totally
expressionless
voice
he
looked
over
hagarty
bent
head
at
harold
gardener
and
one
eye
drew
down
in
a
wink
yes
hagarty
said
not
looking
up
i
know
how
it
sounds
so
then
you
threw
him
over
boutillier
said
bum
rush
not
me
unwin
said
looking
up
he
flicked
the
hair
out
of
his
eyes
with
one
hand
and
stared
at
them
urgently
when
i
saw
they
really
meant
to
do
it
i
tried
to
pull
steve
away
because
i
knew
the
guy
might
get
banged
up
it
was
like
ten
feet
to
the
water
it
was
twentythree
one
of
chief
rademacher
patrolmen
had
already
measured
but
it
was
like
he
was
crazy
the
two
of
them
kept
yelling
bum
rush
bum
rush
and
they
picked
him
up
webby
had
him
under
the
arms
and
steve
had
him
by
the
seat
of
the
pants
and...and
when
hagarty
saw
what
they
were
doing
he
rushed
back
toward
them
screaming
no
no
n
at
the
top
of
his
voice
chris
unwin
pushed
him
backward
and
hagarty
landed
in
a
teethrattling
heap
on
the
sidewalk
do
you
want
to
go
over
to
he
whispered
you
run
bab
they
threw
adrian
mellon
over
the
bridge
and
into
the
water
then
hagarty
heard
the
splash
let
get
out
of
here
steve
dubay
said
he
and
webby
were
backing
toward
the
car
chris
unwin
went
to
the
railing
and
looked
over
he
saw
hagarty
first
sliding
and
clawing
his
way
down
the
weedy
trash
littered
embankment
to
the
water
then
he
saw
the
clown
the
clown
was
dragging
adrian
out
on
the
far
side
with
one
arm
its
balloons
were
in
its
other
hand
adrian
was
dripping
wet
choking
moaning
the
clown
twisted
its
head
and
grinned
up
at
chris
chris
said
he
saw
its
shining
silver
eyes
and
its
bared
teeth
great
big
teeth
he
said
like
the
lion
in
the
circus
ma
he
said
i
mean
they
were
that
big
then
he
said
he
saw
the
clown
shove
one
of
adrian
mellon
arms
back
so
it
lay
over
his
head
then
what
chris
boutillier
said
he
was
bored
with
this
part
fairy
tales
had
bored
him
since
the
age
of
eight
on
dunno
chris
said
that
was
when
steve
grabbed
me
and
hauled
me
into
the
car
but
i
think
it
bit
into
his
armpit
he
looked
up
at
them
again
uncertain
now
i
think
that
what
it
did
bit
nto
his
armpit
like
it
wanted
to
eat
him
man
like
it
wanted
to
eat
his
heart
no
hagarty
said
when
he
was
presented
with
chris
unwin
story
in
the
form
of
questions
the
clown
did
not
drag
ade
up
on
the
far
bank
at
least
not
that
he
saw
and
he
would
grant
that
he
had
been
something
less
than
a
disinterested
observer
by
that
point
by
that
point
he
had
been
out
of
his
fucking
mind
the
clown
he
said
was
standing
near
the
far
bank
with
adrian
dripping
body
clutched
in
its
arms
ades
right
arm
was
stuck
stiffly
out
behind
the
clown
head
and
the
clown
face
was
indeed
in
ade
right
armpit
but
it
was
not
biting
it
was
smiling
hagarty
could
see
it
looking
out
from
beneath
ade
arm
and
smiling
the
clown
arms
tightened
and
hagarty
heard
ribs
splinter
ade
shrieked
float
with
us
do
the
clown
said
out
of
its
grinning
red
mouth
and
then
pointed
with
one
of
its
whitegloved
hands
under
the
bridge
balloons
floated
against
the
underside
of
the
bridge
not
a
dozen
or
a
dozen
dozens
but
thousands
red
and
blue
and
green
and
yellow
and
printed
on
the
side
of
each
was
y
derry
well
now
that
surely
does
sound
like
a
lot
of
balloons
reeves
said
and
tipped
harold
gardener
another
wink
i
know
how
it
sounds
hagarty
reiterated
in
the
same
dreary
voice
you
saw
those
balloons
gardener
said
don
hagarty
slowly
held
his
hands
up
in
front
of
his
face
i
saw
them
as
clearly
as
i
can
see
my
own
fingers
at
this
moment
thousands
of
them
you
couldn't
even
see
the
underside
of
the
bridge
there
were
too
many
of
them
they
were
rippling
a
little
and
sort
of
bouncing
up
and
down
there
was
a
sound
a
funny
low
squealing
noise
that
was
their
sides
rubbing
together
and
strings
there
was
a
forest
of
white
strings
hanging
down
they
looked
like
white
strands
of
spiderweb
the
clown
took
ade
under
there
i
could
see
its
suit
brushing
through
those
strings
ade
was
making
awful
choking
sounds
i
started
after
him
and
the
clown
looked
back
i
saw
its
eyes
and
all
at
once
i
understood
who
it
was
who
was
it
do
harold
gardener
asked
softly
it
was
derry
don
hagarty
said
it
was
this
town
and
what
did
you
do
then
it
was
reeves
tran
you
dumb
shit
hagarty
said
and
burst
into
tears
harold
gardener
kept
his
peace
until
november
th
the
day
before
john
garton
and
steven
dubay
were
to
go
on
trial
in
derry
district
court
for
the
murder
of
adrian
mellon
then
he
went
to
see
tom
boutillier
he
wanted
to
talk
about
the
clown
boutilier
didn't
but
when
he
saw
gardener
might
do
something
stupid
without
a
little
guidance
he
did
there
was
no
clown
harold
the
only
clowns
out
that
night
were
those
three
kids
you
know
that
as
well
as
i
do
we
have
two
witnesses
oh
that
crap
unwin
decided
to
bring
on
the
onearmed
man
as
in
we
didn't
kill
the
poor
little
faggot
it
was
the
onearmed
man
as
soon
as
he
understood
he'd
really
gotten
his
buns
into
some
hot
water
this
time
hagarty
was
hysterical
he
stood
by
and
watched
those
kids
murder
his
best
friend
it
wouldn't
have
surprised
me
if
he'd
seen
flyng
saucers
but
boutillier
knew
better
gardener
could
see
it
in
his
eyes
and
the
assistant
da
ducking
and
dodging
irritated
him
come
o
he
said
we're
talking
about
independent
witnesses
here
don't
bullshit
me
oh
you
want
to
talk
bullshit
are
you
telling
me
you
believe
there
was
a
vampire
clown
under
the
main
street
bridge
because
that
my
idea
of
bullshit
no
not
exactly
but
or
that
hagarty
saw
a
billion
balloons
under
there
each
imprinted
with
exactly
the
same
thing
as
what
was
written
on
his
lover
hat
because
that
is
also
my
idea
of
bullshit
no
but
then
why
are
you
bothering
with
this
stop
crossexamining
m
gardener
roared
they
both
described
it
the
same
and
neither
knew
what
the
other
one
was
saying
boutillier
had
been
sitting
at
his
desk
playing
with
a
pencil
now
he
put
the
pencil
down
got
up
and
walked
over
to
harold
gardener
boutillier
was
five
inches
shorter
but
gardener
retreated
a
step
before
the
man
anger
do
you
want
us
to
lose
this
case
harold
no
of
course
n
do
you
want
those
running
sores
to
walk
free
n
okay
good
since
we
both
agree
on
the
basics
i'll
tell
you
exactly
what
i
think
yes
there
was
probably
a
man
under
the
bridge
that
night
maybe
he
was
even
wearing
a
clown
suit
although
i've
dealt
with
enough
witnesses
to
guess
maybe
it
was
just
a
stewbum
or
a
transient
wearing
a
bunch
of
castoff
clothes
i
think
he
was
probably
down
there
scrounging
for
dropped
change
or
roadmeat
half
a
burger
someone
chucked
over
the
side
or
maybe
the
crumbs
from
the
bottom
of
a
frito
bag
their
eyes
did
the
rest
harold
now
is
that
possible
don't
know
harold
said
he
wanted
to
be
convinced
but
given
the
exact
tally
of
the
two
descriptions
no
he
didn't
think
it
was
possible
here
the
bottom
line
i
don't
care
if
it
was
kinko
the
klown
or
a
guy
in
an
uncle
sam
suit
on
stilts
or
hubert
the
happy
homo
if
we
introduce
this
fellow
into
the
case
their
lawyer
is
going
to
be
on
it
before
you
can
say
jack
robinson
he
going
to
say
those
two
little
innocent
lambs
out
there
with
their
fresh
haircuts
and
new
suits
didn't
do
anything
but
toss
that
gay
fellow
mellon
over
the
side
of
the
bridge
for
a
joke
he'll
point
out
that
mellon
was
still
alive
after
he
took
the
fall
they
have
hagarty
testimony
as
well
as
unwin
for
that
his
clients
didn't
commit
murder
oh
no
it
was
a
psycho
in
a
clown
suit
if
we
introduce
this
that
going
to
happen
and
you
know
it
unwin
going
to
tell
that
story
anyhow
but
hagarty
isn't
boutillier
said
because
he
understands
without
hagarty
who
going
to
believe
unwin
well
there
us
harold
gardener
said
with
a
bitterness
that
surprised
even
himself
but
i
guess
we're
not
telling
oh
give
me
a
break
boutillier
roared
throwing
up
his
hands
they
killed
him
they
didn't
just
throw
him
over
the
side
garton
had
a
switchblade
mellon
was
stabbed
seven
times
including
once
in
the
left
lung
and
twice
in
the
testicles
the
wounds
match
the
blade
four
of
his
ribs
were
broken
dubay
did
that
bearhugging
him
he
was
bitten
all
right
there
were
bites
on
his
arms
his
left
cheek
his
neck
i
think
that
was
unwin
and
garton
although
we've
only
got
one
clear
match
and
that
one
probably
not
clear
enough
to
stand
up
in
court
and
so
all
right
there
was
a
big
chunk
of
meat
gone
from
his
right
armpit
so
what
one
of
them
really
liked
to
bite
probably
even
got
himself
a
pretty
good
boneon
while
he
was
doing
it
i'm
betting
garton
although
we'll
never
prove
it
and
mellon
earlobe
was
gone
boutillier
stopped
glaring
at
harold
if
we
let
in
this
clown
story
we'll
never
bring
it
home
to
them
do
you
want
that
no
i
told
you
the
guy
was
a
fruit
but
he
wasn't
hurting
anyone
boutillier
said
so
h+hothedairyo
along
come
these
three
pusholes
in
their
engineer
boots
and
they
steal
his
life
i'm
going
to
put
them
in
the
slam
my
friend
and
if
i
hear
they
got
their
puckery
little
assholes
cored
down
there
at
thomaston
i'm
gonna
send
them
cards
saying
i
hope
whoever
did
it
had
aids
very
fiery
gardener
thought
and
the
convictions
will
also
look
very
good
on
your
record
when
you
run
for
the
top
spot
in
two
years
but
he
left
without
saying
more
because
he
also
wanted
to
see
them
put
away

a
clown
chapter
six
phone
calls
stanley
uris
takes
a
bath
patricia
uris
later
told
her
mother
she
should
have
known
something
was
wrong
she
should
have
known
it
she
said
because
stanley
never
took
baths
in
the
early
evening
he
showered
early
each
morning
and
sometimes
soaked
late
at
night
with
a
magazine
in
one
hand
and
a
cold
beer
in
the
other
but
baths
at
p.m
were
not
his
style
and
then
there
was
the
thing
about
the
books
it
should
have
delighted
him
instead
in
some
obscure
way
she
did
not
understand
it
seemed
to
have
upset
and
depressed
him
about
three
months
before
that
terrible
night
stanley
had
discovered
that
a
childhood
friend
of
his
had
turned
out
to
be
a
writer
not
a
real
writer
patricia
told
her
mother
but
a
novelist
the
name
on
the
books
was
william
denbrough
but
stanley
had
sometimes
called
him
stuttering
bill
he
had
worked
his
way
through
almost
all
of
the
man
books
had
in
fact
been
reading
the
last
on
the
night
of
the
bath
the
night
of
may
th
patty
herself
had
picked
up
one
of
the
earlier
ones
out
of
curiosity
she
had
put
it
down
after
just
three
chapters
it
had
not
just
been
a
novel
she
told
her
mother
later
it
had
been
a
horrorbook
she
said
it
just
that
way
all
one
word
the
way
she
would
have
said
sexbook
patty
was
a
sweet
kind
woman
but
not
terribly
articulate
she
had
wanted
to
tell
her
mother
how
much
that
book
had
frightened
her
and
why
it
had
upset
her
but
had
not
been
able
it
was
full
of
monsters
she
said
full
of
monsters
chasing
after
little
children
there
were
killings
and
i
don't
know
bad
feelings
and
hurt
stuff
like
that
it
had
in
fact
struck
her
as
almost
pornographic
that
was
the
word
which
kept
eluding
her
probably
because
she
had
never
in
her
life
spoken
it
although
she
knew
what
it
meant
but
stan
felt
as
if
he'd
rediscovered
one
of
his
childhood
chums
he
talked
about
writing
to
him
but
i
knew
he
wouldn't
i
knew
those
stories
made
him
feel
bad
too
and...and
and
then
patty
uris
began
to
cry
that
night
lacking
roughly
six
months
of
being
twentyeight
years
from
the
day
in
when
george
denbrough
had
met
pennywise
the
clown
stanley
and
patty
had
been
sitting
in
the
den
of
their
home
in
a
suburb
of
atlanta
the
tv
was
on
patty
was
sitting
in
the
love
seat
in
front
of
it
dividing
her
attention
between
a
pile
of
sewing
and
her
favorite
game
show
family
feud
she
simply
adored
richard
dawson
and
thought
the
watchchain
he
always
wore
was
terribly
sexy
although
wild
horses
would
not
have
drawn
this
admission
out
of
her
she
also
liked
the
show
because
she
almost
always
got
the
most
popular
answers
there
were
no
right
answers
on
family
feud
exactly
only
the
most
popular
ones
she
had
once
asked
stan
why
the
questions
that
seemed
so
easy
to
her
usually
seemed
so
hard
to
the
families
on
the
show
probably
a
lot
tougher
when
you're
up
there
under
those
light
stanley
had
replied
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
a
shadow
had
drifted
over
his
face
every
thing
a
lot
tougher
when
it
for
real
that
when
you
choke
when
it
for
real
that
was
probably
very
true
she
decided
stanley
had
really
fine
insights
into
human
nature
sometimes
much
finer
she
considered
than
his
old
friend
william
denbrough
who
had
gotten
rich
writing
a
bunch
of
horrorbooks
which
appealed
to
people
baser
natures
not
that
the
urises
were
doing
so
badly
themselves
the
suburb
where
they
lived
was
a
fine
one
and
the
home
which
they
had
purchased
for
$
in
would
probably
now
sell
quickly
and
painlessly
for
$
not
that
she
wanted
to
sell
but
such
things
were
good
to
know
she
sometimes
drove
back
from
the
fox
run
mall
in
her
volvo
stanley
drove
a
mercedes
diesel
teasing
him
she
called
it
sedanley
and
saw
her
house
set
tastefully
back
behind
low
yew
hedges
and
thought
who
lives
there
why
i
do
mrs
stanley
uris
does
this
was
not
an
entirely
happy
thought
mixed
with
it
was
a
pride
so
fierce
that
it
sometimes
made
her
feel
a
bit
ill
once
upon
a
time
you
see
there
had
been
a
lonely
eighteen
yearold
girl
named
patricia
blum
who
had
been
refused
entry
to
the
afterprom
party
that
was
held
at
the
country
club
in
the
upstate
town
of
glointon
new
york
she
had
been
refused
admission
of
course
because
her
last
name
rhymed
with
plum
that
was
her
just
a
skinny
little
kike
plum
that
had
been
and
such
discrimination
was
against
the
law
of
course
hardeharharhar
and
besides
it
was
all
over
now
except
that
for
part
of
her
it
was
never
going
to
be
over
part
of
her
would
always
be
walking
back
to
the
car
with
michael
rosenblatt
listening
to
the
crushed
gravel
under
her
pumps
and
his
rented
formal
shoes
back
to
his
father
car
which
michael
had
borrowed
for
the
evening
and
which
he
had
spent
the
afternoon
waxing
part
of
her
would
always
be
walking
next
to
michael
in
his
rented
white
dinner
jacket
how
it
had
glimmered
in
the
soft
spring
night
she
had
been
in
a
pale
green
evening
gown
which
her
mother
declared
made
her
look
like
a
mermaid
and
the
idea
of
a
kike
mermaid
was
pretty
funny
hardeharharhar
they
had
walked
with
their
heads
up
and
she
had
not
wept
not
then
but
she
had
understood
they
weren't
walking
back
no
not
really
what
they
had
been
doing
was
slinking
back
slinking
rhymes
with
stinking
both
of
them
feeling
more
jewish
than
they
had
ever
felt
in
their
lives
feeling
like
pawnbrokers
feeling
like
cattlecar
riders
feeling
oily
longnosed
sallowskinned
feeling
like
mockies
sheenies
kikes
wanting
to
feel
angry
and
not
being
able
to
feel
angry
he
anger
came
only
later
when
it
didn't
matter
at
that
moment
she
had
only
been
able
to
feel
ashamed
had
only
been
able
to
ache
and
then
someone
had
laughed
a
high
shrill
tittering
laugh
like
a
fast
run
of
notes
on
a
piano
and
in
the
car
she
had
been
able
to
weep
oh
you
bet
here
is
the
kike
mermaid
whose
name
rhymes
with
plum
just
weeping
away
like
crazy
mike
rosenblatt
had
put
a
clumsy
comforting
hand
on
the
back
of
her
neck
and
she
had
twisted
away
from
it
feeling
ashamed
feeling
dirty
feeling
jewish
the
house
set
so
tastefully
back
behind
the
yew
hedges
made
that
better
but
not
all
better
the
hurt
and
shame
were
still
there
and
not
even
being
accepted
in
this
quiet
sleekly
welltodo
neighborhood
could
quite
make
that
endless
walk
with
the
sound
of
grating
stones
beneath
their
shoes
stop
happening
not
even
being
members
of
this
country
club
where
the
maitre
always
greeted
them
with
a
quietly
respectful
good
evening
mr
and
mrs
uris
she
would
come
home
cradled
in
her
volvo
and
she
would
look
at
her
house
sitting
on
its
expanse
of
green
lawn
and
she
would
often
all
too
often
she
supposed
think
of
that
shrill
titter
and
she
would
hope
that
the
girl
who
had
tittered
was
living
in
a
shitty
tract
house
with
a
goy
husband
who
beat
her
that
she
had
been
pregnant
three
times
and
had
mis
carried
each
time
that
her
husband
cheated
on
her
with
diseased
women
that
she
had
slipped
discs
and
fallen
arches
and
cysts
on
her
dirty
tittering
tongue
she
would
hate
herself
for
these
thoughts
these
uncharitable
thoughts
and
promise
to
do
better
to
stop
drinking
these
bitter
gallandwormwood
cocktails
months
would
go
by
when
she
did
not
think
such
thoughts
she
would
think
maybe
all
of
that
is
finally
past
me
i
am
not
that
girl
of
eighteen
anymore
i
am
a
woman
of
thirtysix
the
girl
who
heard
the
endless
click
and
grate
of
those
driveway
stones
the
girl
who
twisted
away
from
mike
rosenblatt
hand
when
he
tried
to
comfort
her
because
it
was
a
jewish
hand
was
half
a
life
ago
that
silly
little
mermaid
is
dead
i
can
forget
her
now
and
just
be
myself
okay
good
great
but
then
she
would
be
somewhere
at
the
supermarket
maybe
and
she
would
hear
sudden
tittering
laughter
from
the
next
aisle
and
her
back
would
prickle
her
nipples
would
go
hard
and
hurtful
her
hands
would
tighten
on
the
bar
of
the
shopping
cart
or
just
on
each
other
and
she
would
think
someone
just
told
someone
else
that
i'm
jewish
that
i'm
nothing
but
a
bignose
mockie
kike
that
stanley
nothing
but
a
bignose
mockie
kike
he
an
accountant
sure
jews
are
good
with
numbers
we
let
them
into
the
country
club
we
had
to
back
in
when
that
bignose
mockie
gynecologist
won
his
suit
but
we
laugh
at
them
we
laugh
and
laugh
and
laugh
or
she
would
simply
hear
the
phantom
click
and
grate
of
stones
and
think
mermaid
mermaid
then
the
hate
and
shame
would
come
flooding
back
like
a
migraine
headache
and
she
would
despair
not
only
for
herself
but
for
the
whole
human
race
werewolves
the
book
by
denbrough
the
one
she
had
tried
to
read
and
then
put
aside
was
about
werewolves
werewolves
shit
what
did
a
man
like
that
know
about
werewolves
most
of
the
time
however
she
felt
better
than
that
felt
she
was
better
than
that
she
loved
her
man
she
loved
her
house
and
she
was
usually
able
to
love
her
life
and
herself
things
were
good
they
had
not
always
been
that
way
of
course
were
things
ever
when
she
accepted
stanley
engagement
ring
her
parents
had
been
both
angry
and
unhappy
she
had
met
him
at
a
sorority
party
he
had
come
over
to
her
school
from
new
york
state
university
where
he
was
a
scholarship
student
they
had
been
introduced
by
a
mutual
friend
and
by
the
time
the
evening
was
over
she
suspected
that
she
loved
him
by
the
midterm
break
she
was
sure
when
spring
came
around
and
stanley
offered
her
a
small
diamond
ring
with
a
daisy
pushed
through
it
she
had
accepted
it
in
the
end
in
spite
of
their
qualms
her
parents
had
accepted
it
as
well
there
was
little
else
they
could
do
although
stanley
uris
would
soon
be
sallying
forth
into
a
jobmarket
glutted
with
young
accountants
and
when
he
went
into
that
jungle
he
would
do
so
with
no
family
finances
to
backstop
him
and
with
their
only
daughter
as
his
hostage
to
fortune
but
patty
was
twentytwo
a
woman
now
and
would
herself
soon
graduate
with
a
ba
til
be
supporting
that
foureyed
son
of
a
bitch
for
the
rest
of
my
life
patty
had
heard
her
father
say
one
night
her
mother
and
father
had
gone
out
for
dinner
and
her
father
had
drunk
a
little
too
much
shh
she'll
hear
you
ruth
blum
said
patty
had
lain
awake
that
night
until
long
after
midnight
dryeyed
alternately
hot
and
cold
hating
them
both
she
had
spent
the
next
two
years
trying
to
get
rd
of
that
hate
there
was
too
much
hate
inside
her
already
sometimes
when
she
looked
into
the
mirror
she
could
see
the
things
it
was
doing
to
her
face
the
fine
lines
it
was
drawing
there
that
was
a
battle
she
won
stanley
had
helped
her
his
own
parents
had
been
equally
concerned
about
the
marriage
they
did
not
of
course
believe
their
stanley
was
destined
for
a
life
of
squalor
and
poverty
but
they
thought
the
kids
were
being
hasty
donald
uris
and
andrea
bertoly
had
themselves
married
in
their
early
twenties
but
they
seemed
to
have
forgotten
the
fact
only
stanley
had
seemed
sure
of
himself
confident
of
the
future
unconcerned
with
the
pitfalls
their
parents
saw
strewn
all
about
the
kids
and
in
the
end
it
was
his
confidence
rather
than
their
fears
which
had
been
justified
in
july
of
with
the
ink
barely
dry
on
her
diploma
patty
had
landed
a
job
teaching
shorthand
and
business
english
in
traynor
a
small
town
forty
miles
south
of
atlanta
when
she
thought
of
how
she
had
come
by
that
job
it
always
struck
her
as
a
little
well
eerie
she
had
made
a
list
of
forty
possibles
from
the
ads
in
the
teachers
journals
then
had
written
forty
letters
over
five
nights
eight
each
evening
requesting
further
information
on
the
job
and
an
application
for
each
twentytwo
replies
indicated
that
the
positions
had
been
filled
in
other
cases
a
more
detailed
explanation
of
the
skills
needed
made
it
clear
she
wasn't
in
the
running
applying
would
only
be
a
waste
of
her
time
and
theirs
she
had
finished
with
a
dozen
possibles
each
looked
as
likely
as
any
other
stanley
had
come
in
while
she
was
puzzling
over
them
and
wondering
if
she
could
possibly
manage
to
fill
out
a
dozen
teaching
applications
without
going
totally
bonkers
he
looked
at
the
strew
of
papers
on
the
table
and
then
tapped
the
letter
from
the
traynor
superintendent
of
schools
a
letter
which
to
her
looked
no
more
or
less
encouraging
than
any
of
the
others
ther
he
said
she
looked
up
at
him
startled
by
the
simple
certainty
in
his
voice
do
you
know
something
about
georgia
that
i
don't
nope
only
time
i
was
ever
there
was
at
the
movies
she
looked
at
him
an
eyebrow
cocked
gone
with
the
wind
vivien
leigh
clark
gable
i
will
think
about
it
tomorrow
for
tomorrow
is
anothah
day
do
i
sound
like
i
come
from
the
south
patty
yes
south
bronx
if
you
don't
know
anything
about
georgia
and
you've
never
been
there
then
why
because
it
right
you
can't
know
that
stanley
sure
i
can
he
said
simply
i
do
looking
at
him
she
had
seen
he
wasn't
joking
he
really
meant
it
she
had
felt
a
ripple
of
unease
go
up
her
back
how
do
you
know
he
had
been
smiling
a
little
now
the
smile
faltered
and
for
a
moment
he
had
seemed
puzzled
his
eyes
had
darkened
as
if
he
looked
inward
consulting
some
interior
device
which
ticked
and
whirred
correctly
but
which
ultimately
he
understood
no
more
than
the
average
man
understands
the
workings
of
the
watch
on
his
wrist
the
turtle
couldn't
help
us
he
said
suddenly
he
said
that
quite
clearly
she
heard
it
that
inward
look
that
look
of
surprised
musing
was
still
on
his
face
and
it
was
starting
to
scare
her
stanley
what
are
you
talking
about
stanley
he
jerked
she
had
been
eating
peaches
as
she
went
over
the
applications
and
his
hand
struck
the
dish
it
fell
on
the
floor
and
broke
his
eyes
seemed
to
clear
oh
shit
i'm
sorry
tt
all
right
stanley
what
were
you
talking
about
i
forget
he
said
but
i
think
we
ought
to
think
georgia

he
said
so
she
did
her
interview
had
gone
smashingly
she
had
known
she
had
the
job
when
she
got
on
the
train
back
to
new
york
the
head
of
the
business
department
had
taken
an
instant
liking
to
patty
and
she
to
him
she
had
almost
heard
the
click
the
confirming
letter
had
come
a
week
later
the
traynor
consolidated
school
department
could
offer
her
$
and
a
probationary
contract

herbert

when
his

told
him
she
intended
to
take
the
job
and
you
will
be
hot
while

stanley
said
when
she
told
him
what
her
father
had
said
she
had
been
furious
near
tears
but
now
she
began
to
giggle
and
stanley
swept
her
into
his
arms
hot
they
had
been
starved
they
had
not
they
were
married
on
august
th
patty
uris
had
gone
to
her
marriage
bed
a
virgin
she
had
slipped
naked
between
cool
sheets
at
a
resort
hotel
in
the
poconos
her
mood
turbulent
and
stormy
lightningflares
of
wanting
and
delicious
lust
dark
clouds
of
fright
when
stanley
slid
into
bed
beside
her
ropy
with
muscle
his
penis
an
exclamation
point
rising
from
gingery
pubic
hair
she
had
whispered
don't
hurt
me
dear
i
will
never
hurt
you
he
said
as
he
took
her
in
his
arms
and
it
was
a
promise
he
had
kept
faithfully
until
may
th
the
night
of
the
bath
her
teaching
had
gone
well
stanley
got
a
job
driving
a
bakery
truck
for
one
hundred
dollars
a
week
in
november
of
that
year
when
the
traynor
flats
shopping
center
opened
he
got
a
job
with
the
block
office
out
there
for
a
hundred
and
fifty
their
combined
income
was
then
$
a
year
this
seemed
a
king
ransom
to
them
in
those
days
when
gas
sold
for
thirtyfive
cents
a
gallon
and
a
loaf
of
white
bread
could
be
had
for
a
nickel
less
than
that
in
march
with
no
fuss
and
no
fanfare
patty
uris
had
thrown
away
her
birth
control
pills
in
stanley
quit
block
and
opened
his
own
business
all
four
inlaws
agreed
that
this
was
a
foolhardy
move
not
that
stanley
should
not
have
his
own
business
god
forbid
he
should
not
have
his
own
business
but
it
was
too
early
all
of
them
agreed
and
it
put
too
much
of
the
financial
burden
on
patty
at
least
until
the
pisher
knocks
her
u
herbert
blum
told
his
brother
morosely
after
a
night
of
drinking
in
the
kitchen
and
then
/’i/
be
expected
to
carry
them.
the
consensus
of
inlaw
opinion
on
the
matter
was
that
a
man
should
not
even
think
about
going
into
business
for
himself
until
he
had
reached
a
more
serene
and
mature
age
seventyeight
say
again
stanley
seemed
almost
preternaturally
confident
he
was
young
personable
bright
apt
he
had
made
contacts
working
for
block
all
of
these
things
were
givens
but
he
could
not
have
known
that
corridor
video
a
pioneer
in
the
nascent
videotape
business
was
about
to
settle
on
a
huge
patch
of
farmedout
land
less
than
ten
miles
from
the
suburb
to
which
the
urises
had
eventually
moved
in
nor
could
he
have
known
that
corridor
would
be
in
the
market
for
an
independent
marketing
survey
less
than
a
year
after
its
move
to
traynor
even
if
stan
had
been
privy
to
some
of
this
information
he
surely
could
not
have
believed
they
would
give
the
job
to
a
young
bespectacled
jew
who
also
happened
to
be
a
damyankee
a
jew
with
an
easy
grin
a
hipshot
way
of
walking
a
taste
for
bell
bottomed
jeans
on
his
days
off
and
the
last
ghosts
of
his
adolescent
acne
still
on
his
face
yet
they
had
they
had
and
it
seemed
that
stan
had
known
it
all
along
his
work
for
cv
led
to
an
offer
of
a
fulltime
position
with
the
company
starting
salary
$
a
year
and
that
really
is
only
the
start
stanley
told
patty
in
bed
that
night
they
are
going
to
grow
like
corn
in
august
my
dear
if
no
one
blows
up
the
world
in
the
next
ten
years
or
so
they
are
going
to
be
right
up
there
on
the
big
board
along
with
kodak
and
sony
and
rca
so
what
are
you
going
to
do
she
asked
already
knowing
am
going
to
tell
them
what
a
pleasure
it
was
to
do
business
with
them
he
said
and
laughed
and
drew
her
close
and
kissed
her
moments
later
he
mounted
her
and
there
were
climaxes
one
two
and
three
like
bright
rockets
ing
off
in
a
night
sky
but
there
was
no
baby
his
work
with
corridor
video
had
brought
him
into
contact
with
some
of
atlanta
richest
and
most
powerful
men
and
they
were
both
astonished
to
find
that
these
men
were
mostly
okay
in
them
they
found
a
degree
of
acceptance
and
broadminded
kindliness
that
was
almost
unknown
in
the
north
patty
remembered
stanley
once
writing
home
to
his
mother
and
father
the
best
rich
men
in
america
live
in
atlanta
georgia
i
am
going
to
help
make
some
of
them
richer
and
they
are
going
to
make
me
richer
and
no
one
is
going
to
own
me
except
my
wife
patricia
and
since
i
already
own
her
i
guess
that
is
safe
enough
by
the
time
they
moved
from
traynor
stanley
was
incorporated
and
employed
six
people
in
their
income
had
entered
unknown
territory
territory
of
which
patty
had
heard
only
the
dimmest
rumors
this
was
the
fabled
land
of
six
figures
and
it
had
all
happened
with
the
casual
ease
of
slipping
into
a
pair
of
sneakers
on
saturday
morning
this
sometimes
frightened
her
once
she
had
made
an
uneasy
joke
about
deals
with
the
devil
stanley
had
laughed
until
he
almost
choked
but
to
her
it
hadn't
seemed
that
funny
and
she
supposed
it
never
would
the
turtle
couldn't
help
us
sometimes
for
no
reason
at
all
she
would
wake
up
with
this
thought
in
her
mind
like
the
last
fragment
of
an
otherwise
forgotten
dream
and
she
would
turn
to
stanley
needing
to
touch
him
needing
to
make
sure
he
was
still
there
it
was
a
good
life
there
was
no
wild
drinking
no
outside
sex
no
drugs
no
boredom
no
bitter
arguments
about
what
to
do
next
there
was
only
a
single
cloud
it
was
her
mother
who
first
mentioned
the
presence
of
this
cloud
that
her
mother
would
be
the
one
to
finally
do
so
seemed
in
retrospect
preordained
it
finally
came
out
as
a
question
in
one
of
ruth
slum
letters
she
wrote
patty
once
a
week
and
that
particular
letter
had
arrived
in
the
early
fall
of
it
came
forwarded
from
the
old
traynor
address
and
patty
read
it
in
a
living
room
filled
with
cardboard
liquorstore
cartons
from
which
spilled
their
possessions
looking
forlorn
and
uprooted
and
dispossessed
in
most
ways
it
was
the
usual
ruth
blum
letter
from
home
four
closely
written
blue
pages
each
one
headed
just
a
note
from
ruth
her
scrawl
was
nearly
illegible
and
stanley
had
once
complained
he
could
not
read
a
single
word
his
motherinlaw
wrote
why
would
you
want
to
patty
had
responded
this
one
was
full
of
mom
usual
brand
of
news
for
ruth
blum
recollection
was
a
broad
delta
spreading
out
from
the
moving
point
of
the
now
in
an
everwidening
fan
of
interlocking
relationships
many
of
the
people
of
whom
her
mother
wrote
were
beginning
to
fade
in
patty
memory
like
photographs
in
an
old
album
but
to
ruth
all
of
them
remained
fresh
her
concerns
for
their
health
and
her
curiosity
about
their
various
doings
never
seemed
to
wane
and
her
prognoses
were
unfailingly
dire
her
father
was
still
having
too
many
stomachaches
he
was
sure
it
was
just
dyspepsia
the
dea
that
he
might
have
an
ulcer
she
wrote
would
not
cross
his
mind
until
he
actually
began
coughing
up
blood
and
probably
not
even
then
you
know
your
father
dear
he
works
like
a
mule
and
he
also
thinks
like
one
sometimes
god
should
forgive
me
for
sying
so
randi
harlengen
had
gotten
her
tubes
tied
they
took
cysts
as
big
as
golfballs
out
of
her
ovaries
no
malignancy
thank
god
but
twentyseven
ovarian
cysts
could
you
die
it
was
the
water
in
new
york
city
she
was
quite
sure
of
that
the
city
air
was
dirty
too
but
she
was
convinced
it
was
the
water
that
really
got
to
you
after
awhile
it
built
up
deposits
inside
a
person
she
doubted
if
patty
knew
how
often
she
had
thanked
god
that
you
kid
were
out
in
the
country
where
both
air
and
water
but
particularly
the
water
were
healthier

never

richie
huber
had
been
fired
again
and
in
the
middle
of
this
chatty
and
often
catty
outpouring
in
the
middle
of
a
paragraph
a
propos
of
nothing
which
had
gone
before
or
which
came
after
ruth
blum
had
casually
asked
the
dreaded
question
so
when
are
you
and
stan
going
to
make
us
grandparents
we're
all
ready
to
start
spoiling
him
or
her
rotten
and
in
case
you
hadn't
noticed
patsy
we're
not
getting
any
younger
and
then
on
to
the
bruckner
girl
from
down
the
block
who
had
been
sent
home
from
school
because
she
was
wearing
no
bra
and
a
blouse
that
you
could
see
right
through
feeling
low
and
homesick
for
their
old
place
in
traynor
feeling
unsure
and
more
than
a
little
afraid
of
what
might
be
ahead
patty
had
gone
into
what
was
to
become
their
bedroom
and
had
lain
down
upon
the
mattress
the
box
spring
was
still
out
in
the
garage
and
the
mattress
lying
all
by
itself
on
the
big
carpetless
floor
looked
like
an
artifact
cast
up
on
a
strange
yellow
beach
she
put
her
head
in
her
arms
and
lay
there
weeping
for
nearly
twenty
minutes
she
supposed
that
cry
had
been
coming
anyway
her
mother
letter
had
just
brought
it
on
sooner
the
way
dust
hurries
the
tickle
in
your
nose
into
a
sneeze
stanley
wanted
kids
she
wanted
kids
they
were
as
compatible
on
that
subject
as
they
were
on
their
enjoyment
of
woody
alien
films
their
more
or
less
regular
attendance
at
synagogue
their
political
leanings
their
dislike
of
marijuana
a
hundred
other
things
both
great
and
small
there
had
been
an
extra
room
in
the
traynor
house
which
they
had
split
evenly
down
the
middle
on
the
left
he
had
a
desk
for
working
and
a
chair
for
reading
on
the
right
she
had
a
sewing
machine
and
a
cardtable
where
she
did
jigsaw
puzzles
there
had
been
an
agreement
between
them
about
that
room
so
strong
they
rarely
spoke
of
it
it
was
simply
there
like
their
noses
or
the
wedding
rings
on
their
left
hands
someday
that
room
would
belong
to
andy
or
to
jenny
but
where
was
that
child
the
sewing
machine
and
the
baskets
of
fabric
and
the
cardtable
and
the
desk
and
the
lazboy
all
kept
their
places
seeming
each
month
to
solidify
their
holds
on
their
respective
positions
in
the
room
and
to
further
establish
their
legitimacy
so
she
thought
although
she
never
could
quite
crystallize
the
thought
like
the
word
pornographic
it
was
a
concept
that
danced
just
beyond
her
ability
to
quantify
but
she
did
remember
one
time
when
she
got
her
period
sliding
open
the
cupboard
under
the
bathroom
sink
to
get
a
sanitary
napkin
she
remembered
looking
at
the
box
of
stayfree
pads
and
thinking
that
the
box
looked
almost
smug
seemed
almost
to
be
saying
hello
patty
we
are
your
children
we
are
the
only
children
you
will
ever
have
and
we
are
hungry
nurse
us
nurse
us
on
blood
in
three
years
after
she
had
thrown
away
the
last
cycle
of
ovral
tablets
they
saw
a
doctor
named
harkavay
in
atlanta
we
want
to
know
if
there
is
something
wrong
stanley
said
and
we
want
to
know
if
we
can
do
anything
about
it
if
there
is
they
took
the
tests
they
showed
that
stanley
sperm
was
perky
that
patty
eggs
were
fertile
that
all
the
channels
that
were
supposed
to
be
open
were
open
harkavay
who
wore
no
wedding
ring
and
who
had
the
open
pleasant
ruddy
face
of
a
college
grad
student
just
back
from
a
midterm
skiing
vacation
in
colorado
told
them
that
maybe
it
was
just
nerves
he
told
them
that
such
a
problem
was
by
no
means
uncommon
he
told
them
that
there
seemed
to
be
a
psychological
correlative
in
such
cases
that
was
in
some
ways
similar
to
sexual
impotency
the
more
you
wanted
to
the
less
you
could
they
would
have
to
relax
they
ought
if
they
could
to
forget
all
about
procreation
when
they
had
sex
stan
was
grumpy
on
the
way
home
patty
asked
him
why
i
never
do
he
said
do
what
think
of
procreation
during
she
began
to
giggle
even
though
she
was
by
then
feeling
a
bit
lonesome
and
frightened
and
that
night
lying
in
bed
long
after
she
believed
that
stanley
must
be
asleep
he
had
frightened
her
by
speaking
out
of
the
dark
his
voice
was
flat
but
nevertheless
choked
with
tears
it
me
he
said
it
my
fault
she
rolled
toward
him
groped
for
him
held
him
don't
be
a
stupid
she
said
but
her
heart
was
beating
fast
much
too
fast
it
wasn't
just
that
he
had
startled
her
it
was
as
if
he
had
looked
into
her
mind
and
read
a
secret
conviction
she
held
there
but
of
which
she
had
not
known
until
this
minute
with
no
rhyme
no
reason
she
felt
knew
that
he
was
right
there
was
something
wrong
and
it
wasn't
her
it
was
him
something
in
him
don't
be
such
a
klutz
she
whispered
fiercely
against
his
shoulder
he
was
sweating
lightly
and
she
became
suddenly
aware
that
he
was
afraid
the
fear
was
coming
off
him
in
cold
waves
lying
naked
with
him
was
suddenly
like
lying
naked
in
front
of
an
open
refrigerator
tm
not
a
klutz
and
i'm
not
being
stupid
he
said
in
that
same
voice
which
was
simultaneously
flat
and
choked
with
emotion
and
you
know
it
it
me
but
i
don't
know
why
you
can't
know
any
such
thing
her
voice
was
harsh
scolding
her
mother
voice
when
her
mother
was
afraid
and
even
as
she
scolded
him
a
shudder
ran
through
her
body
twisting
it
like
a
whip
stanley
felt
it
and
his
arms
tightened
around
her
sometimes
he
said
sometimes
i
think
i
know
why
sometimes
i
have
a
dream
a
bad
dream
and
i
wake
up
and
i
think
i
know
now
i
know
what
wrong
not
just
you
not
catching
pregnant
everything
everything
that
wrong
with
my
life
stanley
nothing
wrong
with
your
life
don't
mean
from
inside
he
said
from
inside
is
fine
i'm
talking
about
outside
something
that
should
be
over
and
isn't
i
wake
up
from
these
dreams
and
think
my
whole
pleasant
life
has
been
nothing
but
the
eye
of
some
storm
i
don't
understand.”
i'm
afraid
but
then
it
just
fades
the
way
dreams
do
she
knew
that
he
sometimes
dreamed
uneasily
on
half
a
dozen
occasions
he
had
awakened
her
thrashing
and
moaning
probably
there
had
been
other
times
when
she
had
slept
through
his
dark
interludes
whenever
she
reached
for
him
asked
him
he
said
the
same
thing
z
can't
remember
then
he
would
reach
for
his
cigarettes
and
smoke
sitting
up
in
bed
waiting
for
the
residue
of
the
dream
to
pass
through
his
pores
ike
bad
sweat
no
kids
on
the
night
of
may
th
the
night
of
the
bath
their
assorted
inlaws
were
still
waiting
to
be
grandparents
the
extra
room
was
still
an
extra
room
the
stayfree
maxis
and
stayfree
minis
still
occupied
their
accustomed
places
in
the
cupboard
under
the
bathroom
sink
the
cardinal
still
paid
its
monthly
visit
her
mother
who
was
much
occupied
with
her
own
affairs
but
not
entirely
oblivious
to
her
daughter
pain
had
stopped
asking
in
her
letters
and
when
stanley
and
patty
made
their
twiceyearly
trips
back
to
new
york
there
were
no
more
humorous
remarks
about
whether
or
not
they
were
taking
their
vitamin
e
stanley
had
also
stopped
mentioning
babies
but
sometimes
when
he
didn't
know
she
was
looking
she
saw
a
shadow
m
his
face
some
shadow
as
if
he
were
trying
desperately
to
remember
something
other
than
that
one
cloud
their
lives
were
pleasant
enough
until
the
phone
rang
during
the
middle
of
family
feud
on
the
night
of
may
th
patty
had
six
of
stan
shirts
two
of
her
blouses
her
sewing
kit
and
her
oddbutton
box
stan
had
the
new
william
denbrough
novel
not
even
out
in
paperback
yet
in
his
hands
there
was
a
snarling
beast
on
the
front
of
this
book
on
the
back
was
a
bald
man
wearing
glasses
stan
was
sitting
nearer
the
phone
he
picked
it
up
and
said
hello
uris
residence
he
listened
and
a
frown
line
delved
between
his
eyebrows
who
did
you
say
patty
felt
an
instant
of
fright
later
shame
would
cause
her
to
lie
and
tell
her
parents
that
she
had
known
something
was
wrong
from
the
instant
the
telephone
had
rung
but
in
reality
there
had
only
been
that
one
instant
that
one
quick
look
up
from
her
sewing
but
maybe
that
was
all
right
maybe
they
had
both
suspected
that
something
was
coming
long
before
that
phone
call
something
that
didn't
fit
with
the
nice
house
set
tastefully
back
behind
the
low
yew
hedges
something
so
much
a
given
that
it
really
didn't
need
much
of
an
acknowledgment
that
one
sharp
instant
of
fright
like
the
stab
of
a
quickly
withdrawn
icepick
was
enough
is
it
mom
she
mouthed
at
him
in
that
instant
thinking
that
perhaps
her
father
twenty
pounds
overweight
and
prone
to
what
he
called
the
bellyache
since
his
early
forties
had
had
a
heart
attack
stan
shook
his
head
at
her
and
then
smiled
a
bit
at
something
the
voice
on
the
phone
was
saying
you
you
well
i'll
be
goddamned
mike
how
did
y
he
fell
silent
again
listening
as
his
smile
faded
she
recognized
or
thought
she
did
his
analytic
expression
the
one
which
said
someone
was
unfolding
a
problem
or
explaining
a
sudden
change
in
an
ongoing
situation
or
telling
him
something
strange
and
interesting
this
last
was
probably
the
case
she
gathered
a
new
client
an
old
friend
rrhaps
she
turned
her
attention
back
to
the
tv
where
a
woman
was
flinging
her
arms
around
richard
dawson
and
kissing
him
madly
she
thought
that
richard
dawson
must
get
kissed
even
more
than
the
blarney
stone
she
also
thought
she
wouldn't
mind
kissing
him
herself
as
she
began
searching
for
a
black
button
to
match
the
ones
on
stanley
blue
denim
shirt
patty
was
vaguely
aware
that
the
conversation
was
settling
into
a
smoother
groove
stanley
grunted
occasionally
and
once
he
asked
are
you
sure
mike
finally
after
a
very
long
pause
he
said
all
right
i
understand
yes
i
yes
yes
everything
i
have
the
picture
i
what
no
i
can't
absolutely
promise
that
but
i'll
consider
it
carefully
you
know
that
oh
he
did
well
you
bet
of
course
i
do
yes
sure
thank
you
yes
bye
bye
he
hung
up
patty
glanced
at
him
and
saw
him
staring
blankly
into
space
over
the
tv
set
on
her
show
the
audience
was
applauding
the
ryan
family
which
had
just
scored
two
hundred
and
eighty
points
most
of
them
by
guessing
that
the
audience
survey
would
answer
mat
in
response
to
the
question
what
class
will
people
say
junior
hates
most
in
school
the
ryans
were
jumping
up
and
down
and
screaming
joyfully
stanley
however
was
frowning
she
would
later
tell
her
parents
she
thought
stanley
face
had
looked
a
little
off
color
and
so
she
did
but
she
neglected
to
tell
them
she
had
dismissed
it
at
the
time
as
only
a
trick
of
the
table
lamp
with
its
green
glass
shade
who
was
that
stan
hmmm
he
looked
around
at
her
she
thought
the
look
on
his
face
was
one
of
gentle
abstraction
perhaps
mixed
with
minor
annoyance
it
was
only
later
replaying
the
scene
in
her
mind
again
and
again
that
she
began
to
believe
it
was
the
expression
of
a
man
who
was
methodically
unplugging
himself
from
reality
one
cord
at
a
time
the
face
of
a
man
who
was
heading
out
of
the
blue
and
into
the
black
who
was
that
on
the
phone
'
no
on
he
said
no
one
really
i
think
i'll
take
a
bath
he
stood
up
what
at
seven
o'clock
he
didn't
answer
only
left
the
room
she
might
have
asked
him
if
something
was
wrong
might
even
have
gone
after
him
and
asked
him
if
he
was
sick
to
his
stomach
he
was
sexually
uninhibited
but
he
could
be
oddly
prim
about
other
things
and
it
wouldn't
be
at
all
unlike
him
to
say
he
was
going
to
take
a
bath
when
what
he
really
had
to
do
was
whoops
something
which
hadn't
agreed
with
him
but
now
a
new
family
the
piscapos
were
being
introduced
and
patty
just
knew
richard
dawson
would
find
something
funny
to
say
about
that
name
and
besides
she
was
having
the
devil
own
time
finding
a
black
button
although
she
knew
there
were
loads
of
them
in
the
button
box
they
hid
of
course
that
was
the
only
explanation
so
she
let
him
go
and
did
not
think
of
him
again
until
the
creditcrawl
when
she
looked
up
and
saw
his
empty
chair
she
had
heard
the
water
running
into
the
tub
upstairs
and
had
heard
it
stop
five
or
ten
minutes
hter
but
now
she
realized
she
had
never
heard
the
fridge
door
open
and
close
and
that
meant
he
was
up
there
without
a
can
of
beer
someone
had
called
him
up
and
dropped
a
big
fat
problem
in
his
lap
and
had
she
offered
him
a
single
word
of
commiseration
no
tried
to
draw
him
out
a
little
about
it
no
even
noticed
that
something
was
wrong
for
the
third
time
no
all
because
of
that
stupid
tv
show
she
couldn't
even
really
blame
the
buttons
they
were
only
an
excuse
okay
she'd
take
him
up
a
can
of
dixie
and
sit
beside
him
on
the
edge
of
the
tub
scrub
his
back
play
geisha
and
wash
his
hair
if
he
wanted
her
to
and
find
out
just
what
the
problem
was
or
who
it
was
she
got
a
can
of
beer
out
of
the
fridge
and
went
upstairs
with
it
the
first
real
disquiet
stirred
in
her
when
she
saw
that
the
bathroom
door
was
shut
not
just
partway
closed
but
shut
tight
stanley
never
closed
the
door
when
he
was
taking
a
bath
it
was
something
of
a
joke
between
them
the
closed
door
meant
he
was
dong
something
his
mother
had
taught
him
the
open
door
meant
he
would
not
be
averse
to
doing
something
the
teaching
of
which
his
mother
had
quite
properly
left
to
others
patty
tapped
on
the
door
with
her
nails
suddenly
aware
too
aware
of
the
reptilian
clicking
sound
they
made
on
the
wood
and
surely
tapping
on
the
bathroom
door
knocking
like
a
guest
was
something
she
had
never
done
before
in
her
married
life
not
here
not
on
any
other
door
in
the
house
the
disquiet
suddenly
grew
strong
in
her
and
she
thought
of
carson
lake
where
she
had
gone
swimming
often
as
a
girl
by
the
first
of
august
the
lake
was
as
warm
as
a
tub
but
then
you'd
hit
a
cold
pocket
that
would
shiver
you
with
surprise
and
delight
one
minute
you
were
warm
the
next
moment
it
felt
as
if
the
temperature
had
plummeted
twenty
degrees
below
your
hips
minus
the
delight
that
was
how
she
felt
now
as
if
she
had
just
struck
a
cold
pocket
only
this
cold
pocket
was
not
below
her
hips
chilling
her
long
teenager
legs
in
the
black
depths
of
carson
lake
this
one
was
around
her
heart
stanley
stan
this
time
she
did
more
than
tap
with
her
nails
she
rapped
on
the
door
when
there
was
still
no
answer
she
hammered
on
it
stanley
'
her
heart
her
heart
vasn't
in
her
chest
anymore
it
was
beating
in
her
throat
making
it
hard
to
breathe
stanley
in
the
silence
following
her
shout
and
just
the
sound
of
herself
shouting
up
here
less
than
thirty
feet
from
the
place
where
she
laid
her
head
down
am
went
to
sleep
each
night
frightened
her
even
more
she
heard
a
sound
which
brought
panic
up
from
the
belowstairs
part
of
her
mind
like
an
unwelcome
guest
such
a
small
sound
really
it
was
only
the
sound
of
dripping
water
plink
pause
plink
pause
plink
pause
plink
she
could
see
the
drops
forming
on
the
snout
of
the
faucet
growing
heavy
and
fat
there
growing
pregnant
there
and
then
falling
off
plink
just
that
sound
no
other
and
she
was
suddenly
terribly
sure
that
it
had
been
stanley
not
her
father
who
had
been
stricken
with
a
heart
attack
tonight
with
a
moan
she
gripped
the
cut
glass
doorknob
and
turned
it
yet
still
the
door
would
not
move
it
was
locked
and
suddenly
three
nevers
occurred
to
patty
uris
in
rapid
succession
stanley
never
took
a
bath
in
the
early
evening
stanley
never
closed
the
door
unless
he
was
using
the
toilet
and
stanley
had
never
locked
the
door
against
her
at
all
was
it
possible
she
wondered
crazily
to
prepare
for
a
heart
attack
patty
ran
her
tongue
over
her
lips
it
produced
a
sound
in
her
head
like
fine
sandpaper
sliding
along
a
board
and
called
his
name
again
there
was
still
no
answer
except
the
steady
deliberate
drip
of
the
faucet
she
looked
down
and
saw
she
still
held
the
can
of
dixie
beer
in
one
hand
she
gazed
at
it
stupidly
her
heart
running
like
a
rabbit
in
her
throat
she
gazed
at
it
as
if
she
had
never
seen
a
can
of
beer
in
her
whole
life
before
this
minute
and
indeed
it
seemed
she
never
had
or
at
bast
never
one
like
this
because
when
she
blinked
her
eyes
it
turned
into
a
telephone
handset
as
black
and
as
threatening
as
a
snake
may
i
help
you
ma'am
do
you
have
a
proble
the
snake
spat
at
her
patty
slammed
it
down
in
its
cradle
and
stepped
away
rubbing
the
hand
which
had
held
it
she
looked
around
and
saw
she
was
back
in
the
tv
room
and
understood
that
the
panic
which
had
come
into
the
front
of
her
mind
like
a
prowler
walking
quietly
up
a
flight
of
stairs
had
had
its
way
with
her
now
she
could
remember
dropping
the
beer
can
outside
the
bathroom
door
and
pelting
headlong
back
down
the
stairs
thinking
vaguely
this
is
all
a
mistake
of
some
kind
and
we'll
laugh
about
it
later
he
filled
up
the
tub
and
then
remembered
he
didn't
have
cigarettes
and
went
out
to
get
them
before
he
took
his
clothes
off
yes
only
he
had
already
locked
the
bathroom
door
from
the
inside
and
because
it
was
too
much
of
a
bother
to
unlock
it
again
he
had
simply
opened
the
window
over
the
tub
and
gone
down
the
side
of
the
house
like
a
fly
crawling
down
a
wall
sure
of
course
sure
panic
was
rising
in
her
mind
again
it
was
like
bitter
black
coffee
threatening
to
overflow
the
rim
of
a
cup
she
closed
her
eyes
and
fought
against
it
she
stood
there
perfectly
still
a
pale
statue
with
a
pulse
beating
in
its
throat
now
she
could
remember
running
back
down
here
feet
stuttering
on
the
stairlevels
running
for
the
phone
oh
yes
oh
sure
but
who
had
she
meant
to
call
crazily
she
thought
j
would
call
the
turtle
but
the
turtle
couldn't
help
us
it
didn’t
matter
anyway
she
had
gotten
as
far
as
zero
and
she
must
have
said
something
not
quite
standard
because
the
operator
had
asked
if
she
had
a
problem
she
had
one
all
right
but
how
did
you
tell
that
faceless
voice
that
stanley
had
locked
himself
in
the
bathroom
and
didn't
answer
her
that
the
steady
sound
of
the
water
dripping
into
the
tub
was
killing
her
heart
someone
had
to
help
her
someone
she
put
the
back
of
her
hand
into
her
mouth
and
deliberately
bit
down
on
it
she
tried
to
think
tried
to
force
herself
to
think
the
spare
keys
the
spare
keys
in
the
kitchen
cupboard
she
got
going
and
one
slippered
foot
kicked
the
bag
of
buttons
resting
beside
her
chair
some
of
the
bittons
spilled
out
glittering
like
glazed
eyes
in
the
lamplight
she
saw
at
least
half
a
dozen
black
ones
mounted
inside
the
door
of
the
cupboard
over
the
doublebasin
sink
was
a
large
varnished
board
in
the
shape
of
a
key
one
of
stan
clients
had
made
it
in
his
workshop
and
given
it
to
him
two
christmases
ago
the
keyboard
was
studded
with
small
hooks
and
swinging
on
these
were
all
the
keys
the
house
took
two
duplicates
of
each
to
a
hook
beneath
each
hook
was
a
strip
of
mystik
tape
each
strip
lettered
in
stan
small

back
door
off
to
one
side
were

dupes
labelled

and
volvo
patty
snatched
the
key
marked
upstairs
bath
began
to
run
for
the
stairs
and
then
made
herself
walk
running
made
the
panic
want
to
come
back
and
the
panic
was
too
close
to
the
surface
as
it
was
also
if
she
just
walked
maybe
nothing
would
be
wrong
or
if
there
was
something
wrong
god
could
look
down
see
she
was
just
walking
and
think
oh
good
i
pulled
a
hell
of
a
boner
but
i've
got
time
to
take
it
all
back
walking
as
sedately
as
a
woman
on
her
way
to
a
ladie
book
circle
meeting
she
went
up
the
stairs
and
down
to
the
closed
bathroom
door
stanley
she
called
trying
the
door
again
at
the
same
time
suddenly
more
afraid
than
ever
not
wanting
to
use
the
key
because
having
to
use
the
key
was
somehow
too
final
if
god
hadn't
taken
it
back
by
the
time
she
used
the
key
then
he
never
would
the
age
of
miracles
after
all
was
past
but
the
door
was
still
locked
the
deliberate
plink
pause
of
dripping
water
was
her
only
answer
her
hand
was
shaking
and
the
key
chattered
all
the
way
around
the
plate
before
finding
its
way
into
the
keyhole
and
socking
itself
home
she
turned
it
and
heard
the
lock
snap
back
she
fumbled
for
the
cutglass
knob
it
tried
to
slide
through
her
hand
again
not
because
the
door
was
locked
this
tune
but
because
her
palm
was
wet
with
sweat
she
firmed
her
grip
and
made
it
turn
she
pushed
the
door
open
stanley
stanley
s
she
looked
at
the
tub
with
its
blue
shower
curtain
bunched
at
the
far
end
of
the
stainless
steel
rod
and
forgot
how
to
finish
her
husband
name
she
simply
stared
at
the
tub
her
face
as
solemn
as
the
face
of
a
child
on
her
first
day
at
school
in
a
moment
she
would
begin
to
scream
and
anita
mackenzie
next
door
would
hear
her
and
it
would
be
anita
mackenzie
who
would
call
the
police
convinced
that
someone
had
broken
into
the
uris
house
and
that
people
were
being
killed
over
there
but
for
now
this
one
moment
patty
uris
simply
stood
silent
with
her
hands
«
clasped
in
front
of
her
against
her
dark
cotton
skirt
her
face
solemn
her
eyes
huge
and
now
the
look
of
almost
holy
solemnity
began
transform
itself
into
something
else
the
huge
eyes
began
to
bulge
her
mouth
pulled
back
into
a
dreadful
grin
of
horror
she
wanted
to
scream
and
couldn't
the
screams
were
too
big
to
come
out
the
bathroom
was
lit
by
fluorescent
tubes
it
was
very
bright
there
were
no
shadows
you
could
see
everything
whether
you
wanted
to
or
not
the
water
in
the
tub
was
bright
pink
stanley
lay
with
his
back
propped
against
the
rear
of
the
tub
his
head
had
rolled
so
far
back
on
his
neck
that
strands
of
his
short
black
hair
brushed
the
skin
between
his
shoulderblades
if
his
staring
eyes
had
still
been
capable
of
seeing
she
would
have
looked
upside
down
to
him
his
mouth
hung
open
like
a
sprung
door
his
expression
was
one
of
abysmal
frozen
horror
a
package
d
gillette
platinum
plus
razor
blades
lay
on
the
rim
of
the
tub
he
had
slit
his
inner
forearms
open
from
wrist
to
the
crook
of
the
elbow
and
then
had
crossed
each
of
these
cuts
just
below
the
bracelets
of
fortune
making
a
pair
of
bloody
capital
the
gashes
glared
redpurple
in
the
harsh
white
light
she
thought
the
exposed
tendons
and
ligaments
looked
like
cuts
of
cheap
beef
a
drop
of
water
gathered
at
the
lip
of
the
shiny
chromium
faucet
it
grew
fat
grew
pregnant
you
might
say
it
sparkled
it
dropped
plink
he
had
dipped
his
right
forefinger
in
his
own
blood
and
had
written
a
single
word
on
the
blue
tiles
above
the
tub
written
it
in
two
huge
staggering
letters
a
zigzagging
bloody
fingermark
fell
away
from
the
second
letter
of
this
word
his
finger
had
made
that
mark
she
saw
as
his
hand
fell
into
the
tub
where
it
now
floated
she
thought
stanley
must
have
made
that
mark
his
final
impression
on
the
world
as
he
lost
consciousness
it
seemed
to
ta
another
drop
fell
into
the
tub
plink
that
did
it
patty
uris
at
last
found
her
voice
staring
into
her
husband
dead
and
sparkling
eyes
she
began
to
scream
richard
tozier
takes
a
powder
rich
felt
like
he
was
doing
pretty
good
until
the
vomiting
started
he
had
listened
to
everything
mike
hanlon
told
him
said
all
the
right
things
answered
mike
questions
even
asked
a
few
of
his
own
he
was
vaguely
aware
that
he
was
doing
one
of
his
voices
not
a
strange
and
outrageous
one
like
those
he
sometimes
did
on
the
radio
kinky
briefcase
sexual
accountant
was
his
own
personal
favorite
at
least
for
the
tune
being
and
positive
listener
response
on
kinky
was
almost
as
high
as
for
his
listeners
alltime
favorite
colonel
buford
kissdrivel
but
a
warm
rich
confident
voice
an
i'malright
voice
it
sounded
great
but
it
was
a
lie
just
like
all
the
other
voices
were
lies
how
much
do
you
remember
rich
mike
asked
him
very
little
rich
said
and
then
paused
enough
i
suppose
will
you
come
tii
come
rich
said
and
hung
up
he
sat
in
his
study
for
a
moment
leaning
back
in
the
chair
behind
his
desk
looking
out
at
the
pacific
ocean
a
couple
of
kids
were
down
on
the
left
horsing
around
on
their
surfboards
not
really
riding
them
there
wasn't
much
surf
to
ride
the
clock
on
the
desk
an
expensive
led
quartz
that
had
been
a
gift
from
a
record
company
rep
said
that
it
was
p.m
on
may
th
it
would
of
course
be
three
hours
later
where
mike
was
alling
from
dark
already
he
felt
a
prickle
of
gooseflesh
at
that
and
he
began
to
move
to
do
things
first
of
course
he
put
on
a
record
not
hunting
just
grabbing
blindly
among
the
thousands
racked
on
the
shelves
rock
and
roll
was
almost
as
much
a
part
of
his
life
as
the
voices
and
it
was
hard
for
him
to
do
anything
without
music
playing
and
the
louder
the
better
the
record
he
grabbed
turned
out
to
be
a
motown
retrospective
marvin
gaye
one
of
the
newer
members
of
what
rich
sometimes
called
the
all
dead
band
came
on
singing
heard
it
through
the
grapevine
li
ooohhoo
i
bet
your
wond'rin
how
i
knew
not
bad
rich
said
he
even
smiled
a
little
this
was
bad
and
it
had
admittedly
knocked
him
for
a
loop
but
he
felt
that
he
was
going
to
be
able
to
handle
it
no
sweat
he
began
getting
ready
to
go
back
home
and
at
some
point
during
the
next
hour
it
occurred
to
him
that
it
was
as
if
he
had
died
and
had
yet
been
allowed
to
make
all
of
his
own
final
business
dispositions
.not
to
mention
his
own
funeral
arrangements
and
he
felt
as
if
he
was
doing
pretty
good
he
tried
the
travel
agent
he
used
thinking
she
would
probably
be
on
the
freeway
and
headed
home
by
now
but
taking
a
shot
on
the
offchance
for
a
wonder
he
caught
ber
in
he
told
her
what
he
needed
and
she
asked
him
for
fifteen
minutes
i
owe
you
one
carol
he
said
they
had
progressed
from
mr
tozier
and
ms
feeny
to
rich
and
carol
over
the
last
three
years
pretty
chummy
considering
they
had
never
met
face
b
face
all
right
pay
off
she
said
can
you
do
kinky
briefcase
for
me
without
even
pausing
if
you
had
to
pause
to
find
your
voice
there
was
usually
no
voice
there
to
be
found
rich
said
kinky
briefcase
sexual
accountant
here
i
had
a
fellow
come
in
the
other
day
who
wanted
to
know
what
the
worst
thing
was
about
getting
aids
his
voice
had
dropped
slightly
at
the
same
time
its
rhythm
had
speeded
up
and
become
jaunty
it
was
clearly
an
american
voice
and
yet
it
somehow
conjured
up
mages
of
a
wealthy
british
colonial
chappie
who
was
as
charming
in
his
muddled
way
as
he
was
addled
rich
hadn't
the
slightest
idea
who
kinky
briefcase
really
was
but
he
was
sure
he
always
wore
white
suits
read
esquire
and
drank
things
which
came
in
tall
glasses
and
smelled
like
coconutscented
shampoo
i
told
him
right
away
trying
to
explain
to
your
mother
how
you
picked
it
up
from
a
haitian
girl
until
next
time
this
is
kinky
briefcase
sexual
accountant
saying
you
need
my
card
if
you
can't
get
hard
carol
feeny
screamed
with
laughter
that
perfect
perfect
my
boyfriend
says
he
doesn't
believe
you
can
just
do
those
voices
he
says
it
got
to
be
a
voicefilter
gadget
or
something
just
talent
my
dear
rich
said
kinky
briefcase
was
gone
w
c
fields
top
hat
red
nose
golf
bags
and
all
was
here
t'm
so
stuffed
with
talent
i
have
to
plug
up
all
my
bodily
orifices
to
keep
it
from
just
running
out
like
well
just
running
out
she
went
off
into
another
screamy
gale
of
laughter
and
rich
closed
his
eyes
he
could
feel
the
beginnings
of
a
headache
be
a
dear
and
see
what
you
can
do
would
you
he
asked
still
being
w
c
fields
and
hung
up
on
her
laughter
now
he
had
to
go
back
to
being
himself
and
that
was
hard
it
got
harder
to
do
that
every
year
it
was
easier
to
be
brave
when
you
were
someone
else
he
was
trying
to
pick
out
a
pair
of
good
loafers
and
had
about
decided
to
stick
with
sneakers
when
the
phone
rang
again
it
was
carol
feeny
back
in
record
time
he
felt
an
instant
urge
to
fall
into
the
buford
kissdrivel
voice
and
fought
it
off
she
had
been
able
to
get
him
a
firstclass
seat
on
the
american
airlines
redeye
nonstop
from
lax
to
boston
he
would
leave
la
at
p.m
and
arrive
at
logan
about
five
o'clock
tomorrow
morning
delta
would
fly
him
out
of
boston
at
a.m
and
into
bangor
maine
at
she
had
gotten
him
a
fullsized
sedan
from
avis
and
it
was
only
twentysix
miles
from
the
avis
counter
at
bangor
intemational
airport
to
the
derry
town
line
only
twentysix
miles
rich
thought
is
that
all
carol
well
maybe
it
is
in
miles
anyway
but
you
don't
have
the
slightest
idea
how
far
it
really
is
to
derry
and
i
don't
either
but
oh
god
oh
dear
god
i
am
going
to
find
out
didn't
try
for
a
room
because
you
didn't
tell
me
how
long
you'd
be
there
she
said
do
you
no
let
me
take
care
of
that
rich
said
and
then
buford
kissdrivel
took
over
you've
been
a
peach
my
deah
a
jawja
peach
a
cawse
he
hung
up
gently
on
her
always
leave
em
laughing
and
then
dialed
for
state
of
maine
directory
assistance
he
wanted
a
number
for
the
derry
town
house
god
there
was
a
name
from
the
past
he
hadn't
thought
of
the
derry
town
house
in
what
ten
years
twenty
twentyfive
years
even
crazy
as
it
seemed
he
guessed
it
had
been
at
least
twentyfive
years
and
if
mike
hadn't
called
he
supposed
he
might
never
have
thought
of
it
again
in
his
life
and
yet
there
had
been
a
time
in
his
life
when
he
had
walked
past
that
great
red
brick
pile
every
day
and
on
more
than
one
occasion
he
had
run
past
it
with
henry
bowers
and
belch
huggins
and
that
other
big
boy
victor
somebody
orother
in
hot
pursuit
all
of
them
yelling
little
pleasantries
like
we're
gonna
getcha
fuckface
gonna
getcha
you
little
smartass
gonna
getcha
you
foureyed
faggot
had
they
ever
gotten
him
before
rich
could
remember
an
operator
was
asking
him
what
city
please
in
derry
operator
derry
god
even
the
word
felt
strange
and
forgotten
in
his
mouth
saying
it
was
like
kissing
an
antique
do
you
have
a
number
for
the
derry
town
house
one
moment
sir
no
way
it'll
be
gone
razed
in
an
urbanrenewal
program
changed
into
an
elk
hall
or
a
bowladrome
or
an
electric
dreamscape
video
arcade
or
maybe
burned
down
one
night
when
the
odds
finally
ran
out
on
some
drunk
shoe
salesman
smoking
in
bed
all
gone
richie
just
like
the
glasses
henry
bowers
always
used
to
rag
you
about
what
that
springsteen
song
say
glory
days
gone
in
the
wink
of
a
young
girl
eye
what
young
girl
why
bev
of
course
bev
changed
the
town
house
might
be
but
gone
it
apparently
was
not
because
a
blank
robotic
voice
now
came
on
the
line
and
said
the
number...is
repeat
...the...number...is
but
rich
had
gotten
it
the
first
time
it
was
a
pleasure
to
hang
up
on
that
droning
voice
it
was
too
easy
to
imagine
some
great
globular
directory
assistance
monster
buried
somewhere
in
the
earth
sweating
rivets
and
holding
thousands
of
telephones
in
thousands
of
jointed
chromium
tentacles
the
ma
bell
version
of
spidey
nemesis
dr
octopus
each
year
the
world
rich
lived
in
felt
more
and
more
like
a
huge
electronic
haunted
house
in
which
digital
ghosts
and
frightened
human
beings
lived
in
uneasy
coexistence
still
standing
to
paraphrase
paul
simon
still
standing
after
all
these
years
he
dialed
the
hotel
he
had
last
seen
through
the
hornrimmed
spectacles
of
his
childhood
dialing
that
number
was
fatally
easy
he
held
the
telephone
to
his
ear
looking
out
his
study
wide
picture
window
the
surfers
were
gone
a
couple
were
walking
slowly
up
the
beach
hand
in
hand
where
they
had
been
the
couple
could
have
been
a
poster
on
the
wall
of
the
travel
agency
where
carol
feeny
worked
that
was
how
perfect
they
were
except
that
was
for
the
fact
they
were
both
wearing
glasses
gonna
getcha
fuckface
gonna
break
your
glasses
criss
his
mind
sent
up
abruptly
his
last
name
was
criss
victor
criss
oh
christ
that
was
nothing
he
wanted
to
know
not
at
this
late
date
but
it
didn't
seem
to
matter
in
the
slightest
something
was
happening
down
there
in
the
vaults
down
there
where
rich
tozier
kept
his
own
personal
collection
of
golden
oldies
doors
were
opening
only
they're
not
records
down
there
are
they
down
there
you're
not
rich
record
tozier
hotshot
klad
deejay
and
the
man
of
a
thousand
voices
are
you
and
those
things
that
are
opening
they
aren't
exactly
doors

they

tried
to
shake
these
thoughts
off
thing
to
remember
is
that
i'm
okay
i'm
okay
you're
okay
rich
tozier
okay
could
use
a
cigarette

years
ago
but
he
could
use
one
now
all
right
they're
not
records
but
dead
bodies
you
buried
them
deep
but
now
there
some
kind
of
crazy
earthquake
going
on
and
the
ground
is
spitting
them
up
to
the
surface

not
rich

town
hous
a
male
voice
with
a
yankee
tang
said
it
had
travelled
all
the
way
across
new
england
the
midwest
and
under
the
casinos
of
las
vegas
to
reach
his
ear
rich
asked
the
voice
if
he
could
reserve
a
suite
of
rooms
at
the
town
house
beginning
tomorrow
the
voice
told
him
he
could
and
then
asked
him
for
how
long
i
can't
say
i've
got
he
paused
briefly
minutely
what
did
he
have
exactly
in
his
mind
eye
he
saw
a
boy
with
a
tartan
bookbag
running
from
the
tough
guys
he
saw
a
boy
who
wore
glasses
a
thin
boy
with
a
pale
face
that
had
somehow
seemed
to
scream
hit
me
go
on
and
hit
me
in
some
mysterious
way
to
every
passing
bully
here
my
lips
mash
them
back
against
my
teeth
here
my
nose
bloody
it
for
sure
and
break
it
if
you
can
box
an
ear
so
it
swells
up
like
a
cauliflower
split
an
eyebrow
here
my
chin
go
for
the
knockout
button
here
are
my
eyes
so
blue
and
so
magnified
behind
these
hateful
hateful
glasses
these
hornrimmed
specs
one
bow
of
which
is
held
on
with
adhesive
tape
break
the
specs
drive
a
shard
of
glass
into
one
of
these
eyes
and
close
it
forever
what
the
hell
he
closed
his
eyes
and
said
tve
got
business
in
derry
you
see
i
don't
know
how
long
the
transaction
will
take
how
about
three
days
with
an
option
to
renew
an
option
to
renew
the
deskclerk
asked
doubtfully
and
rich
waited
patiently
for
the
fellow
to
work
it
over
in
his
mind
oh
i
get
you
that
very
good
thank
you
and
i
ah
hope
you
can
vote
for

in
novemba
john

said
jackie

office
and
i've

a
job
all
lined
up
for
my...ah...brothah
bobby
mr
tozie
yes
okay
somebody
else
got
on
the
line
there
for
a
few
seconds
just
an
old
pol
from
the
dop
rich
thought
that
dead
old
party
in
case
you
should
wonder
don't
worry
about
it
a
shudder
worked
through
him
and
he
told
himself
again
almost
desperately
you're
okay
rich
heard
it
too
rich
said
must
have
been
a
line
crossover
how
we
looking
on
that
room
oh
there
no
problem
with
that
the
clerk
said
we
do
business
here
in
derry
but
it
really
never
booms
is
that
so
oh
ayu
the
clerk
agreed
and
rich
shuddered
again
he
had
forgotten
that
too
that
simple
northern
new
englandism
for
yes
oh
ayuh
gonna
getcha
creep
the
ghostly
voice
of
henry
bowers
screamed
and
he
felt
more
crypts
cracking
open
inside
of
him
the
stench
he
smelled
was
not
decayed
bodies
but
decayed
memories
and
that
was
somehow
worse
he
gave
the
town
house
clerk
his
american
express
number
and
hung
up
then
he
called
steve
covall
the
klad
program
director
what
up
rich
steve
asked
the
last
arbitron
ratings
had
shown
klad
at
the
top
of
the
cannibalistic
los
angeles
fmrock
market

steve

been
in
an
excellent
mood
thank
god

small
favors

be
sorry

aske
he
told
steve

powder

steve
voice

rich

keith
moon
there
was
silence
on
the
line
rich
waited
patiently

not
serious

you
steve
finally
asked
he
sounded
plaintive
i
mean
unless

mother

she
godforbid
die
she
died
ten
years
ago
have
you
got
a
brain
tumor
not

rectal
polyp
this
is
not
funny
rich
no
you're
being
a
fucking
busher
and
i
don't
like
it
don't
like
it
either
but
i
have
to
go
where
why
what
is
this
talk
to
me
rich
someone
called
me
someone
i
used
to
know
a
long
time
ago
in
another
place
back
then
something
happened
i
made
a
promise
we
all
promised
that
we
would
go
back
if
the
something
started
happening
again
and
i
guess
it
has
what
something
are
we
talking
about
rich
td
just
as
soon
not
say
also
you'll
think
i'm
crazy
if
i
tell
you
the
truth
i
don't
remember
when
did
you
make
this
famous
promise
a
long
time
ago
in
the
summer
of
there
was
another
long
pause
and
he
knew
steve
covall
was
trying
to
decide
if
rich
record
tozier
aka
buford
kissdrivel
aka
wyatt
the
homicidal
bag
boy
etc
etc
was
having
him
on
or
was
having
some
kind
of
mental
breakdown
you
would
have
been
just
a
kid
steve
said
flatly
eleven
going
on
twelve
another
long
pause
rich
waited
patiently
all
right
steve
said
til
shift
the
rotation
put
mike
in
for
you
i
can
call
chuck
foster
to
pull
a
few
shifts
i
guess
if
i
can
find
what
chinese
restaurant
he
currently
holed
up
in
i'll
do
it
because
we
go
back
a
long
way
together
but
i'm
never
going
to
forget
you
bushed
out
on
me
rich
oh
get
down
off
it
rich
said
but
the
headache
was
getting
worse
he
knew
what
he
was
doing
did
steve
really
think
he
didn't
i
need
a
few
days
off
is
all
you're
acting
like
i
took
a
shit
on
our
fcc
charter
a
few
days
off
for
what
the
reunion
of
your
cub
scout
pack
in
shithouse
falls
north
dakota
or
pussyhump
city
west
virginia
actually
i
think
shithouse
falls
in
arkansas
bo
buford
kissdrivel
said
in
his
big
hollow
barrel
voice
but
steve
was
not
to
be
diverted
because
you
made
a
promise
when
you
were
eleven
kids
don't
make
serious
promises
when
they're
eleven
for
christ
sake
and
it
not
even
that
rich
and
you
know
it
this
is
not
an
insurance
company
this
is
not
a
law
office
this
is
showbusiness
be
it
ever
so
humble
and
you
fucking
well
know
it
if
you
had
given
me
a
week
notice
i
wouldn't
be
holding
this
phone
in
one
hand
and
a
bottle
of
mylanta
in
the
other
you
are
putting
my
balls
to
the
wall
and
you
know
it
so
don't
you
insult
my
intelligence
steve
was
nearly
screaming
now
and
rich
closed
his
eyes
i'm
never
going
to
forget
it
steve
had
said
and
rich
supposed
he
never
would
but
steve
had
also
said
kids
didn't
make
serious
promises
when
they
were
eleven
and
that
wasn't
true
at
all
rich
couldn't
remember
what
the
promise
had
been
wasn't
sure
he
wanted
to
remember
but
it
had
been
plenty
serious
steve
i
have
to
yeah
and
i
told
you
i
could
handle
it
so
go
ahead
go
ahead
you
busher
steve
this
is
rid
but
steve
had
already
hung
up
rich
put
the
phone
down
he
had
barely
started
away
from
it
when
it
began
to
ring
again
and
he
knew
without
picking
it
up
that
it
was
steve
again
madder
than
ever
talking
to
him
at
this
point
would
do
no
good
things
would
just
get
uglier
he
slid
the
switch
on
the
side
of
the
phone
to
the
right
cutting
it
off
in
midring
he
went
upstairs
pulled
two
suitcases
out
of
the
closet
and
filled
them
with
a
barely
glanced
at
conglomeration
of
clothes
jeans
shins
underwear
socks
it
would
not
occur
to
him
until
later
that
he
had
taken
nothing
but
kidclothes
he
carried
the
suitcases
back
downstairs
on
the
den
wall
was
a
blackandwhite
ansel
adams
photograph
of
big
sur
rich
swung
it
back
on
hidden
hinges
exposing
a
barrel
safe
he
opened
it
pawed
his
way
past
the
paperwork
the
house
here
poised
cozily
between
the
faultline
and
the
brushfire
zone
twenty
acres
of
timberland
in
idaho
a
bunch
of
stocks
he
had
bought
the
stocks
seemingly
at
random
when
his
broker
saw
rich
coming
he
immediately
clutched
his
head
but
the
stocks
had
all
risen
steadily
over
the
years
he
was
sometimes
surprised
by
the
thought
that
he
was
almost
not
quite
but
almost
a
rich
man
all
courtesy
of
rockandroll
music
and
the
vores
of
course
house
acres
stocks
insurance
policy
even
a
copy
of
his
last
will
and
testament
the
strings
that
bind
you
tight
to
the
map
of
your
life
he
thought
there
was
a
sudden
wild
impulse
to
whip
out
his
zippo
and
light
it
up
the
whole
whore
combine
of
wherefores
and
knowyeallmenbythesepresent
and
thebearerof
this
certificateisentitled
and
he
could
do
it
too
the
papers
in
his
safe
had
suddenly
ceased
to
signify
anything
the
first
real
terror
struck
him
then
and
there
was
nothing
at
all
supernatural
about
it
it
was
only
a
realization
of
how
easy
it
was
to
trash
your
life
that
was
what
was
so
scary
you
just
dragged
the
fan
up
to
everything
you
had
spent
the
years
raking
together
and
turned
the
motherfucker
on
easy
burn
it
up
or
blow
it
away
then
just
take
a
powder
behind
the
papers
which
were
only
currency
second
cousins
was
the
real
stuff
the
cash
four
thousand
dollars
in
tens
twenties
and
fifties
taking
it
now
stuffing
it
into
the
pocket
of
his
jeans
he
wondered
if
he
hadn't
somehow
known
what
he
was
doing
when
he
put
the
money
in
here
fifty
bucks
one
month
a
hundred
and
twenty
the
next
maybe
only
ten
the
month
after
that
rathole
money
takinga
powder
money
man
that
scary
he
said
barely
aware
he
had
spoken
he
was
looking
blankly
out
the
big
window
at
the
beach
it
was
deserted
now
the
surfers
gone
the
honeymooners
if
that
was
what
they
had
been
gone
too
ah
yes
doc
it
all
comes
back
to
me
now
remember
stanley
uris
for
instance
bet
your
fur
ido
remember
how
we
used
to
say
that
and
think
it
was
so
cool
stanley
urine
the
big
kids
called
him
hey
urine
hey
you
fuckin
christkiller
where
ya
goin
one
of
ya
fag
friends
gonna
give
you
a
bee
ja
he
slammed
the
safe
door
shut
and
swung
the
picture
back
into
place
when
had
he
last
thought
of
stan
uris
five
years
ago
ten
twenty
rich
and
his
family
had
moved
away
from
derry
in
the
spring
of
and
how
fast
all
of
their
faces
faded
his
gang
that
pitiful
bunch
of
losers
with
their
little
clubhouse
in
what
had
been
known
then
as
the
barrens
funny
name
for
an
area
as
lush
with
growth
as
that
place
had
been
kidding
themselves
that
they
were
jungle
explorers
or
seabees
carving
out
a
landing
strip
on
a
pacific
atoll
while
they
held
off
the
japs
kidding
themselves
that
they
were
dambuilders
cowboys
spacemen
on
a
jungle
world
you
name
it
but
whatever
you
name
it
don't
let
forget
what
it
really
was
it
was
hiding
hiding
from
the
big
kids
hiding
from
henry
bowers
and
victor
criss
and
belch
huggins
and
the
rest
of
them
what
a
bunch
of
losers
they
had
been
stan
unis
with
his
big
jewboy
nose
bill
denbrough
who
could
say
nothing
but
hiyo
silver
without
stuttering
so
badly
that
it
drove
you
almost
dogshit
beverly
marsh
with
her
bruises
and
her
cigarettes
rolled
into
the
sleeve
of
her
blouse
ben
hanscom
who
had
been
so
big
he
looked
like
a
human
version
of
moby
dick
and
richie
tozier
with
his
thick
glasses
and
his
a
averages
and
his
wise
mouth
and
his
face
which
just
begged
to
be
pounded
into
new
and
exciting
shapes
was
there
a
word
for
what
they
had
been
oh
yes
there
always
was
le
mot
juste
in
this
case
le
mot
juste
was
wimps
how
it
came
back
how
all
of
it
came
back
and
now
he
stood
here
in
his
den
shivering
as
helplessly
as
a
homeless
mutt
caught
in
a
thunderstorm
shivering
because
the
guys
he
had
run
with
weren't
all
he
remembered
there
were
other
things
things
he
hadn't
thought
of
in
years
trembling
just
below
the
surface
bloody
things
a
darkness
some
darkness
the
house
on
neibolt
street
and
bill
screaming
you
kkitted
my
brother
you
fuhfuh
fucker
did
he
remember
just
enough
not
to
want
to
remember
any
more
and
you
could
bet
your
fur
on
that
a
smell
of
garbage
a
smell
of
shit
and
a
smell
of
something
else
something
worse
than
either
it
was
the
stink
of
the
beast
the
stink
of
it
down
there
in
the
darkness
under
derry
where
the
machines
thundered
on
and
on
he
remembered
george
but
that
was
too
much
and
he
ran
for
the
bathroom
blundering
into
his
eames
chair
on
his
way
and
almost
falling
he
made
it
barely
he
slid
across
the
slick
tiles
to
the
toilet
on
his
knees
like
some
weird
breakdancer
gripped
the
edges
and
vomited
everything
in
his
guts
even
then
it
wouldn't
stop
suddenly
he
could
see
georgie
denbrough
as
if
he
had
last
seen
him
yesterday
georgie
who
had
been
the
start
of
it
all
georgie
who
had
been
murdered
in
the
fall
of
georgie
had
died
right
after
the
flood
one
of
his
arms
had
been
ripped
from
its
socket
and
rich
had
blocked
all
of
that
out
of
his
memory
but
sometimes
those
things
come
back
oh
yes
indeedy
they
come
back
sometimes
they
come
back
the
spasm
passed
and
rich
groped
blindly
for
the
flush
water
roared
his
early
supper
regurgitated
in
hot
chunks
vanished
tastefully
down
the
drain
into
the
sewers
into
the
pound
and
stink
and
darkness
of
the
sewers
he
closed
the
lid
laid
his
forehead
against
it
and
began
to
cry
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
cried
since
his
mother
died
in
without
even
thinking
of
what
he
was
doing
he
cupped
his
hands
under
his
eyes
and
the
contact
lenses
he
wore
slipped
out
and
lay
glistening
in
his
palms
forty
minutes
later
feeling
huskedout
and
somehow
cleansed
he
threw
his
suitcases
into
the
trunk
of
his
mg
and
backed
it
out
of
the
garage
the
light
was
fading
he
looked
at
his
house
with
the
new
plantings
he
looked
at
the
beach
at
the
water
which
had
taken
on
the
cast
of
pale
emeralds
broken
by
a
narrow
track
of
beaten
gold
and
a
conviction
stole
over
him
that
he
would
never
see
any
of
this
again
that
he
was
a
dead
man
walking
going
home
now
rich
tozier
whispered
to
himself
going
home
god
help
me
going
home
he
put
the
car
in
gear
and
went
feeling
again
how
easy
it
had
been
to
slip
through
an
unsuspected
fissure
in
what
he
had
considered
a
solid
life
how
easy
it
was
to
get
over
onto
the
dark
side
to
sail
out
of
the
blue
and
into
the
black
out
of
the
blue
and
into
the
black
yes
that
was
it
where
anything
might
be
waiting

you
had
your

if
you
had

far
you
would
have
seen
in

the

sunburned
dressed
in

chambray
shirt
faded
jeans
and
a
pair
of
scuffed
engineer
boots
there
were
faint
squintlines
around
the
corners
of
his
eyes
but
nowhere
else
he
looked
perhaps
ten
years
younger
than
his
actual
age
which
was
thirty
eight
hello
mr
hansco
ricky
lee
said
putting
a
paper
napkin
on
the
bar
as
ben
sat
down
ricky
lee
sounded
a
trifle
surprised
and
he
was
he
had
never
seen
hanscom
in
the
wheel
on
a
weeknight
before
he
came
in
regularly
every
friday
night
for
two
beers
and
every
saturday
night
for
four
or
five
he
always
asked
after
ricky
lee
three
boys
he
always
left
the
same
fivedollar
tip
under
his
beer
stein
when
he
took
off
in
terms
of
both
professional
conversation
and
personal
regard
he
was
far
and
away
ricky
lee
favorite
customer
the
ten
dollars
a
week
and
the
fifty
left
under
the
stem
at
each
christmastime
over
the
last
five
years
was
fine
enough
but
the
man
company
was
worth
far
more
worthwhile
company
was
always
a
rarity
but
in
a
honkytonk
like
this
where
talk
always
came
cheap
it
was
scarcer
than
hen
teeth
although
hanscom
roots
were
in
new
england
and
he
had
gone
to
college
in
california
there
was
more
than
a
touch
of
the
extravagant
texan
about
him
ricky
lee
counted
on
ben
hanscom
fridaysaturdaynight
stops
because
he
had
learned
over
the
years
that
he
could
count
on
them
mr
hanscom
might
be
building
a
skyscraper
in
new
york
where
he
already
had
three
of
the
most
talkedabout
buildings
in
the
city
a
new
art
gallery
in
redondo
beach
or
a
business
building
in
salt
lake
city
but
come
friday
night
the
door
leading
to
the
parking
lot
would
open
sometime
between
eight
o'clock
and
ninethirty
and
in
he
would
stroll
as
if
he
lived
no
farther
than
the
other
side
of
town
and
had
decided
to
drop
in
because
there
was
nothing
good
on
tv
he
had
his
own
learjet
and
a
private
landing
strip
on
his
farm
in
junkins
two
years
ago
he
had
been
in
london
first
designing
and
then
overseeing
the
construction
of
the
new
bbc
communications
center
a
building
that
was
still
hotly
debated
pro
and
con
in
the
british
press
the
guardian
perhaps
the
most
beautiful
building
to
be
constructed
in
london
over
the
last
twenty
year
the
mirror
other
than
the
face
of
my
motherinlaw
after
a
pubcrawl
the
ugliest
thing
i
have
ever
seen’
when
mr
hanscom
took
that
job
ricky
lee
had
thought
well
i'll
see
him
again
sometime
or
maybe
he'll
just
forget
all
about
us
and
indeed
the
friday
night
after
ben
hanscom
left
for
england
had
come
and
gone
with
no
sign
of
him
although
ricky
lee
found
himself
looking
up
quickly
every
tune
the
door
opened
between
eight
and
ninethirty
well
i'll
see
him
again
sometime
maybe
sometime
turned
out
to
be
the
next
night
the
door
had
opened
at
quarter
past
nine
and
in
he
had
ambled
wearing
jeans
and
a
go
bama
teeshirt
and
his
old
engineer
boots
looking
like
he'd
come
from
no
farther
away
than
crosstown
and
when
ricky
lee
cried
almost
joyfully
hey
mr
hanscom
christ
what
are
you
doin
here
mr
hanscom
had
looked
mildly
surprised
as
if
there
was
nothing
in
the
least
unusual
about
his
being
here
nor
had
that
been
a
oneshot
he
had
showed
up
every
saturday
during
the
twoyear
course
of
his
active
involvement
in
the
bbc
job
he
left
london
each
saturday
morning
at
a.m
on
the
concorde
he
told
a
fascinated
ricky
lee
and
arrived
at
kennedy
in
new
york
at
a.m
fortyfive
minutes
before
he
left
london
at
least
by
the
clock
‘god
i
like
time
travel
ain't
it
an
impressed
ricky
lee
had
said
a
limousine
was
standing
by
to
take
him
over
to
teterboro
airport
in
new
jersey
a
trip
which
usually
took
no
more
than
an
hour
on
saturday
morning
he
could
be
in
the
cockpit
of
his
lear
before
noon
with
no
trouble
at
all
and
touching
down
in
junkins
by
twothirty
if
you
head
west
fast
enough
he
told
ricky
the
day
just
seems
to
go
on
forever
he
would
take
a
twohour
nap
spend
an
hour
with
his
foreman
and
half
an
hour
with
his
secretary
he
would
eat
supper
and
then
come
on
over
to
the
red
wheel
for
an
hour
and
a
half
or
so
he
always
came
in
alone
he
always
sat
at
the
bar
and
he
always
left
the
way
he
had
come
in
although
god
knew
there
were
plenty
of
women
in
this
part
of
nebraska
who
would
have
been
happy
to
screw
the
socks
off
him
back
at
the
farm
he
would
catch
six
hours
of
sleep
and
then
the
whole
process
would
reverse
itself
ricky
had
never
had
a
customer
who
failed
to
be
impressed
with
this
story
maybe
he
gay
a
woman
had
told
him
once
ricky
lee
glanced
at
her
briefly
taking
in
the
carefully
styled
hair
the
carefully
tailored
clothes
which
undoubtedly
had
designer
labels
the
diamond
chips
at
her
ears
the
look
in
her
eyes
and
knew
she
was
from
somewhere
back
east
probably
new
york
out
here
on
a
brief
duty
visit
to
a
relative
or
maybe
an
old
school
chum
and
couldn't
wait
to
get
out
again
no
he
had
replied
mr
hanscom
ain't
no
sissy
she
had
taken
a
pack
of
doral
cigarettes
from
her
purse
and
held
one
between
her
red
glistening
lips
until
he
lit
it
for
her
how
do
you
know
she
had
asked
smiling
a
little
i
just
do
he
said
and
he
did
he
thought
of
saying
to
her
i
think
he
the
most
godawful
lonely
man
i
ever
met
in
my
life
but
he
wasn't
going
to
say
any
such
thing
to
this
new
york
woman
who
was
looking
at
him
like
he
was
some
new
and
amusing
type
of
life
tonight
mr
hanscom
looked
a
little
pale
a
little
distracted
hello
ricky
lee
he
said
sitting
down
and
then
fell
to
studying
his
hands
ricky
lee
knew
he
was
slated
to
spend
the
next
six
or
eight
months
in
colorado
springs
overseeing
the
start
of
the
mountain
states
cultural
center
a
sprawling
sixbuilding
complex
which
would
be
cut
into
the
side
of
a
mountain
when
it
done
people
are
going
to
say
it
looks
like
a
giantkid
left
his
toy
blocks
all
over
a
flight
of
stairs
ben
had
told
ricky
lee
some
will
anyway
and
they'll
be
at
least
halfright
but
i
think
it
going
to
work
it
the
biggest
thing
i've
ever
tried
and
putting
it
up
is
going
to
be
scary
as
hell
but
i
think
it
going
to
work
ricky
lee
supposed
it
was
possible
that
mr
hanscom
had
a
little
touch
of
stage
fright
nothing
surprising
about
that
and
nothing
wrong
about
it
either
when
you
got
big
enough
to
be
noticed
you
got
big
enough
to
come
gunning
for
or
maybe
he
just
had
a
touch
of
the
bug
there
was
a
hell
of
a
lively
one
going
around
ricky
lee
got
a
beer
stein
from
the
backbar
and
reached
for
the
olympia
tap
don't
do
that
ricky
lee
ricky
lee
turned
back
surprised
and
when
ben
hanscom
looked
up
from
his
hands
he
was
suddenly
frightened
because
mr
hanscom
didn't
look
like
he
had
stage
fright
or
the
virus
that
was
going
around
or
anything
like
that
he
looked
like
he
had
just
taken
a
terrible
blow
and
was
still
trying
to
understand
whatever
it
was
that
had
hit
him
someone
died
he
ain't
married
but
every
man
got
a
fambly
and
someone
in
his
just
bit
the
dust
that
what
happened
just
as
sure
as
shit
rolls
downhill
front
a
privy
someone
dropped
a
quarter
into
the
jukebox
and
barbara
mandrell
started
to
sing
about
a
drunk
man
and
a
lonely
woman
you
okay
mr
hanscom
ben
hanscom
looked
at
ricky
lee
out
of
eyes
that
suddenly
looked
ten
no
twenty
years
older
than
the
rest
of
his
face
arid
ricky
lee
was
astonished
to
observe
that
mr
hanscom’s
hair
was
graying
he
had
never
noticed
any
gray
in
his
hair
before
hanscom
smiled
the
smile
was
ghastly
horrible
it
was
like
watching
a
corpse
smile
i
don't
think
i
am
ricky
lee
no
sir
not
tonight
not
at
all
ricky
lee
set
the
stein
down
and
walked
back
over
to
where
hanscom
sat
the
bar
was
as
empty
as
a
mondaynight
bar
far
outside
of
football
season
can
get
there
were
fewer
than
twenty
paying
customers
in
the
place
annie
was
sitting
by
the
door
into
the
kitchen
playing
cribbage
with
the
shortorder
cook
bad
news
mr
hanscom
bad
news
that
right
bad
news
from
home
he
looked
at
ricky
lee
he
looked
through
ricky
lee
tm
sorry
to
hear
that
mr
hanscom
thank
you
ricky
lee
he
fell
silent
and
ricky
lee
was
about
to
ask
him
if
there
was
anything
he
could
do
when
hanscom
said
what
your
bar
whiskey
ricky
lee
for
everyone
else
in
this
dump
it
four
roses
ricky
lee
said
but
for
you
i
think
it
wild
turkey
hanscom
smiled
a
little
at
that
that
good
of
you
ricky
lee
i
think
you
better
grab
that
stein
after
all
what
you
do
is
fill
it
up
with
wild
turkey
fill
it
ricky
lee
asked
frankly
astonished
christ
i'll
have
to
roll
you
out
of
here
or
call
an
ambulance
he
thought
not
tonight
hanscom
said
i
don't
think
so
ricky
lee
looked
carefully
into
mr
hanscom
eyes
to
see
if
he
could
possibly
be
joking
and
it
took
less
than
a
second
to
see
that
he
wasn't
so
he
got
the
stein
from
the
backbar
and
the
bottle
of
wild
turkey
from
one
of
the
shelves
below
the
neck
of
the
bottle
chattered
against
the
rim
of
the
stein
as
he
began
to
pour
he
watched
the
whiskey
gurgle
out
fascnated
in
spite
of
himself
ricky
lee
decided
it
was
more
than
just
a
touch
of
the
texan
that
mr
hanscom
had
in
him
this
had
to
be
the
biggest
goddamned
shot
of
whiskey
he
ever
had
poured
or
ever
would
pour
in
his
life
call
an
ambulance
my
ass
he
drinks
this
baby
and
i'll
be
calling
parker
and
waters
in
swedholm
for
their
funeral
hack
nevertheless
he
brought
it
back
and
set
it
down
in
front
of
hanscom
ricky
lee
father
had
once
told
him
that
if
a
man
was
in
his
right
mind
you
brought
him
what
he
paid
for
be
it
piss
or
poison
ricky
lee
didn't
know
if
that
was
good
advice
or
bad
but
he
knew
that
if
you
tended
bar
for
a
living
it
went
a
fair
piece
toward
saving
you
from
being
chomped
into
gator
bait
by
your
own
conscience
hanscom
looked
at
the
monster
drink
thoughtfully
for
a
moment
and
then
asked
what
do
i
owe
you
for
a
shot
like
that
ricky
lee
ricky
lee
shook
his
head
slowly
eyes
still
on
the
steinful
of
whiskey
not
wanting
to
look
up
and
meet
those
socketed
staring
eyes
n
he
said
this
one
is
on
the
house
hanscom
smiled
again
this
time
more
naturally
why
i
thank
you
ricky
lee
now
i
am
going
to
show
you
something
i
learned
about
in
peru
in
i
was
working
with
a
guy
named
frank
billings
understudying
with
him
i
guess
you'd
say
frank
billings
was
the
best
damned
architect
in
the
world
i
think
he
caught
a
fever
and
the
doctors
injected
about
a
billion
different
antibiotics
into
him
and
not
a
single
one
of
them
touched
it
he
burned
for
two
weeks
and
then
he
died
what
i'm
going
to
show
you
i
learned
from
the
indians
who
worked
on
the
project
the
local
popskull
is
pretty
potent
you
take
a
slug
and
you
think
it
going
down
pretty
mellow
no
problem
and
then
all
at
once
it
like
someone
lit
a
blowtorch
in
your
mouth
and
aimed
it
down
your
throat
but
the
indians
drink
it
like
cocacola
and
i
rarely
saw
one
drunk
and
i
never
saw
one
with
a
hangover
never
had
the
sack
to
try
it
their
way
myself
but
i
think
i'll
give
it
a
go
tonight
bring
me
some
of
those
lemon
wedges
there
ricky
lee
brought
him
four
and
laid
them
out
neatly
on
a
fresh
napkin
next
to
the
stein
of
whiskey
hanscom
picked
one
of
them
up
tilted
his
head
back
like
a
man
about
to
administer
eyedrops
to
himself
and
then
began
to
squeeze
raw
lemonjuice
into
his
right
nostril
holy
jesus
ricky
lee
cried
horrified
hanscom
throat
worked
his
face
flushed
and
then
ricky
lee
saw
tears
running
down
the
flat
planes
of
his
face
toward
his
ears
now
the
spinners
were
on
the
juke
singing
about
the
rubberbandman
oh
lord
i
just
don't
know
how
much
of
this
i
can
stand
the
spinners
sang
hanscom
groped
blindly
on
the
bar
found
another
slice
of
lemon
and
squeezed
the
juice
into
his
other
nostril
you're
gonna
fucking
kill
yourself
ricky
lee
whispered
hanscom
tossed
both
of
the
wrungout
lemon
wedges
onto
the
bar
his
eyes
were
fiery
red
and
he
was
breathing
in
hitching
wincing
gasps
clear
lemonjuice
dripped
from
both
of
his
nostrils
and
trickled
down
to
the
corners
of
his
mouth
he
groped
for
the
stein
raised
it
and
drank
a
third
of
it
frozen
ricky
lee
watched
his
adam
apple
go
up
and
down
hanscom
set
the
stein
aside
shuddered
twice
then
nodded
he
looked
at
ricky
lee
and
smiled
a
little
his
eyes
were
no
longer
red
works
about
like
they
said
it
did
you
are
so
fucking
concerned
about
your
nose
that
you
never
feel
what
going
down
your
throat
at
all
you're
crazy
mr
hanscom
ricky
lee
said
you
bet
your
fur
mr
hanscom
said
you
remember
that
one
ricky
lee
we
used
to
say
that
when
we
were
kids
you
bet
your
fur
did
i
ever
tell
you
i
used
to
be
fat
no
sir
you
never
did
ricky
lee
whispered
he
was
now
convinced
that
mr
hanscom
had
received
some
intelligence
so
dreadful
that
the
man
really
had
gone
crazy
or
at
least
taken
temporary
leave
of
his
senses
was
a
regular
butterball
never
played
baseball
or
basketball
always
got
caught
first
when
we
played
tag
couldn't
keep
out
of
my
own
way
i
was
fat
all
right
and
there
were
these
fellows
in
my
home
town
who
used
to
take
after
me
pretty
regularly
there
was
a
fellow
named
reginald
huggins
only
everyone
called
him
belch
a
kid
named
victor
criss
a
few
other
guys
but
the
real
brains
of
the
combnation
was
a
fellow
named
henry
bowers
if
there
has
ever
been
a
genuinely
evil
kid
strutting
across
the
skin
of
the
world
ricky
lee
henry
bowers
was
that
kid
i
wasn't
the
only
kid
he
used
to
take
after
my
problem
was
i
couldn't
run
as
fast
as
some
of
the
others
hanscom
unbuttoned
his
shirt
and
opened
it
leaning
forward
ricky
lee
saw
a
funny
twisted
scar
on
mr
hanscom
stomach
just
above
his
navel
puckered
white
and
old
it
was
a
letter
he
saw
someone
had
carved
the
letter
into
the
man
stomach
probably
long
before
mr
hanscom
had
been
a
man
henry
bowers
did
that
to
me
about
a
thousand
years
ago
i'm
lucky
i'm
not
wearing
his
whole
damned
name
down
there
mr
hanscom
hanscom
took
the
other
two
lemonslices
one
n
each
hand
tilted
his
head
back
and
took
them
like
nosedrops
he
shuddered
wrackingly
put
them
aside
and
took
two
big
swallows
from
the
stein
he
shuddered
again
took
another
gulp
and
then
groped
for
the
padded
edge
of
the
bar
with
his
eyes
closed
for
a
moment
he
held
on
like
a
man
on
a
sailboat
clinging
to
the
rail
for
support
in
a
heavy
sea
then
he
opened
his
eyes
again
and
smiled
at
ricky
lee
could
ride
this
bull
all
night
he
said
mr
hanscom
i
wish
you
wouldn't
do
that
anymore
ricky
lee
said
nervously
annie
came
over
to
the
waitresses
stand
with
her
tray
and
called
for
a
couple
of
millers
ricky
lee
drew
them
and
took
them
down
to
her
his
legs
felt
rubbery
is
mr
hanscom
all
right
ricky
lee
annie
asked
she
was
looking
past
ricky
lee
and
he
turned
to
follow
her
gaze
mr
hanscom
was
leaning
over
the
bar
carefully
picking
lemon
slices
out
of
the
caddy
where
ricky
lee
kept
the
drink
garnishes
i
don't
know
he
said
i
don't
think
so
well
get
your
thumb
out
of
your
ass
and
do
something
about
it
annie
was
like
most
other
women
partial
to
ben
hanscom
i
dunno
my
daddy
always
said
that
if
a
man
in
his
right
mind
your
daddy
didn't
have
the
brains
god
gave
a
gopher
annie
said
never
mind
your
daddy
you
got
to
put
a
stop
to
that
ricky
lee
he
going
to
kill
himself
thus
given
his
marching
orders
ricky
lee
went
back
down
to
where
ben
hanscom
sat
mr
hanscom
i
really
think
you've
had
en
hanscom
tilted
his
head
back
squeezed
actually
sniffed
the
lemonjuice
back
this
time
as
if
it
were
cocaine
he
gulped
whiskey
as
if
it
were
water
he
looked
at
ricky
lee
solemnly
bingbang
i
saw
the
whole
gang
dancing
on
my
livingroom
rug
he
said
and
then
laughed
there
was
maybe
two
inches
of
whiskey
left
in
the
stem
that
is
enough
ricky
lee
said
and
reached
for
the
stein
hanscom
moved
it
gently
out
of
his
reach
damage
has
been
done
ricky
lee
he
said
the
damage
has
been
done
boy
mr
hanscom
pkase
tve
got
something
for
your
kids
ricky
lee
damn
if
i
didn't
almost
forget
he
was
wearing
a
faded
denim
vest
and
now
he
reached
something
out
of
one
of
its
pockets
ricky
lee
heard
a
muted
clink
my
dad
died
when
i
was
four
hanscom
said
there
was
no
slur
at
all
in
his
voice
left
us
a
bunch
of
debts
and
these
i
want
your
kiddos
to
have
them
ricky
lee
he
put
three
cartwheel
silver
dollars
on
the
bar
where
they
gleamed
under
the
soft
lights
ricky
lee
caught
his
breath
mr
hanscom
that
very
kind
but
i
couldn't
there
used
to
be
four
but
i
gave
one
of
them
to
stuttering
bill
and
the
others
bill
denbrough
that
was
his
real
name
stuttering
bill
just
what
we
used
to
call
him
just
a
thing
we
used
to
ay
like
you
bet
your
fur
he
was
one
of
the
best
friends
i
ever
had
i
did
have
a
few
you
know
even
a
fat
kid
like
me
had
a
few
stuttering
bill
a
writer
now
ricky
lee
barely
heard
him
he
was
looking
at
the
cartwheels
fascinated
and
god
knew
what
they
were
worth
now
just
in
terms
of
the
pure
silver
they
contained
couldn't
he
said
again
but
i
insist
mr
hanscom
took
hold
of
the
stein
and
drained
it
he
should
have
been
flat
on
his
keister
but
his
eyes
never
left
ricky
lee
those
eyes
were
watery
and
very
bloodshot
but
ricky
lee
would
have
sworn
on
a
stack
of
bibles
that
they
were
also
the
eyes
of
a
sober
man
you're
scaring
me
a
little
mr
hanscom
ricky
lee
said
two
years
ago
gresham
arnold
a
rumdum
of
some
local
repute
had
come
into
the
red
wheel
with
a
roll
of
quarters
in
his
hand
and
a
twenty
dollar
bill
stuck
into
the
band
of
his
hat
he
handed
the
roll
to
annie
with
instructions
to
feed
the
quarters
into
the
jukebox
by
fours
he
put
the
twenty
on
the
bar
and
instructed
ricky
lee
to
set
up
drinks
for
the
house
this
rumdum
this
gresham
arnold
had
long
ago
been
a
star
basketball
player
for
the
hemingford
rams
leading
them
to
their
first
and
most
likely
last
highschool
team
championship
in
that
had
been
an
almost
unlimited
future
seemed
to
lie
ahead
of
the
young
man
but
he
had
flunked
out
of
lsu
his
first
semester
a
victim
of
drink
drugs
and
allnight
parties
he
came
home
cracked
up
the
yellow
convertible
his
folks
had
given
him
as
a
graduation
present
and
got
a
job
as
head
salesman
in
his
daddy
john
deere
dealership
five
years
passed
his
father
could
not
bear
to
fire
him
and
so
he
finally
sold
the
dealership
and
retired
to
arizona
a
man
haunted
and
made
old
before
his
tune
by
the
inexplicable
and
apparently
irreversible
degeneration
of
his
son
while
the
dealership
still
belonged
to
his
daddy
and
he
was
at
least
pretending
to
work
arnold
had
made
some
effort
to
keep
the
booze
at
arm
length
afterward
it
got
him
completely
he
could
get
mean
but
he
had
been
just
as
sweet
as
horehound
candy
the
night
he
brought
in
the
quarters
and
set
up
drinks
for
the
house
and
everyone
had
thanked
him
kindly
and
annie
kept
playing
moe
bandy
songs
because
gresham
arnold
liked
ole
moe
bandy
he
sat
there
at
the
bar
on
the
very
stool
where
mr
hanscom
was
sitting
now
ricky
lee
realized
with
steadily
deepening
unease
and
drank
three
or
four
bourbon
and
bitters
and
sang
along
with
the
juke
and
caused
no
trouble
and
went
home
when
ricky
lee
closed
the
wheel
up
and
hanged
himself
with
his
belt
in
an
upstairs
closet
gresham
arnold
eyes
that
night
had
looked
a
little
bit
like
ben
hanscom
eyes
looked
right
now
scaring
you
a
bit
am
i
hanscom
asked
his
eyes
never
leaving
ricky
lee
he
pushed
the
stein
away
and
then
folded
his
hands
neatly
in
front
of
those
three
silver
cartwheels
i
probably
am
but
you're
not
as
scared
as
i
am
ricky
lee
pray
to
jesus
you
never
are
well
what
the
matter
ricky
lee
asked
maybe
he
wet
his
lips
maybe
i
can
give
you
a
help
the
matter
ben
hanscom
laughed
why
not
too
much
i
had
a
call
from
an
old
friend
tonight
guy
named
mike
hanlon
i'd
forgotten
all
about
him
ricky
lee
but
that
didn't
scare
me
much
after
all
i
was
just
a
kid
when
i
knew
him
and
kids
forget
things
don't
they
sure
they
do
you
bet
your
fur
what
scared
me
was
getting
about
halfway
over
here
and
realizing
that
it
wasn't
just
mike
i'd
forgotten
about
i'd
forgotten
everything
about
being
a
kid
ricky
lee
only
looked
at
him
he
had
no
idea
what
mr
hanscom
was
talking
about
but
the
man
was
scared
all
right
no
question
about
that
it
sat
funny
on
ben
hanscom
but
it
was
real
mean
i'd
forgotten
all
about
it
he
said
and
rapped
his
knuckles
lightly
on
the
bar
for
emphasis
did
you
ever
hear
ricky
lee
of
having
an
amnesia
so
complete
you
didn't
even
know
you
had
amnesia
ricky
lee
shook
his
head
me
either
but
there
i
was
tooling
along
in
the
caddy
tonight
and
all
of
a
sudden
it
hit
me
i
remembered
mike
hanlon
but
only
because
he
called
me
on
the
phone
i
remembered
derry
but
only
because
that
was
where
he
was
calling
from
derry
but
that
was
all
it
hit
me
that
i
hadn't
even
thought
about
being
a
kid
since
since
i
don't
even
know
when
and
then
just
like
that
it
all
started
to
flood
back
in
like
what
we
did
with
the
fourth
silver
dollar
what
did
you
do
with
it
mr
hanscom
hanscom
looked
at
his
watch
and
suddenly
slipped
down
from
his
stool
he
staggered
a
bit
the
slightest
bit
that
was
all
can't
let
the
time
get
away
from
me
he
said
t'm
flying
tonight
ricky
lee
looked
instantly
alarmed
and
hanscom
laughed
flying
but
not
driving
the
plane
not
this
time
united
airlines
ricky
lee
oh
he
supposed
his
relief
showed
on
his
face
but
he
didn't
care
where
are
you
going
hanscom
shirt
was
still
open
he
looked
thoughtfully
down
at
the
puckered
white
lines
of
the
old
scar
on
his
belly
and
then
began
to
button
the
shirt
over
it
thought
i
told
you
that
ricky
lee
home
i'm
going
home
give
those
cartwheels
to
your
kids
he
started
toward
the
door
and
something
about
the
way
he
walked
even
the
way
he
hitched
at
the
sides
of
his
pants
terrified
ricky
lee
the
resemblance
to
the
late
and
mostly
unlamented
gresham
arnold
was
suddenly
so
acute
it
was
nearly
like
seeing
a
ghost
mr
hanscom
he
cried
in
alarm
hanscom
turned
back
and
ricky
lee
stepped
quickly
backward
his
ass
hit
he
backbar
and
glassware
gossiped
briefly
as
the
bottles
knocked
together
he
stepped
back
because
he
was
suddenly
convinced
that
ben
hanscom
was
dead
yes
ben
hanscom
was
lying
dead
someplace
in
a
ditch
or
an
attic
or
possibly
in
a
closet
with
a
belt
noosed
around
his
neck
and
the
toes
of
his
fourhundreddollar
cowboy
boots
dangling
an
inch
or
two
above
the
floor
and
this
thing
standing
near
the
juke
and
staring
back
at
him
was
a
ghost
for
a
moment
just
a
moment
but
it
was
plenty
long
enough
to
cover
his
working
heart
with
a
rime
of
ice
he
was
convinced
he
could
see
tables
and
chairs
right
through
the
man
what
is
it
ricky
lee
nuhn
nuh
nothin
ben
hanscom
looked
out
at
ricky
lee
from
eyes
which
had
darkpurple
crescents
beneath
them
his
cheeks
burned
with
liquor
his
nose
looked
red
and
sore
nothin
ricky
lee
whispered
again
but
he
couldn't
take
his
eyes
from
that
face
the
face
of
a
man
who
has
died
deep
in
sin
and
now
stands
hard
by
hell
smoking
side
door
i
was
fat
and
we
were
poor
ben
hanscom
said
i
remember
that
now
and
i
remember
that
either
a
girl
named
beverly
or
stuttering
bill
saved
my
life
with
a
silver
dollar
i'm
scared
almost
insane
by
whatever
else
i
may
remember
before
tonight
over
but
how
scared
i
am
doesn't
matter
because
it
going
to
come
anyway
it
all
there
like
a
great
big
bubble
that
growing
in
my
mind
but
i'm
going
because
all
i've
ever
gotten
and
all
i
have
now
is
somehow
due
to
what
we
did
then
and
you
pay
for
what
you
get
in
this
world
maybe
that
why
god
made
us
kids
first
and
built
us
close
to
the
ground
because
he
knows
you
got
to
fall
down
a
lot
and
bleed
a
lot
before
you
learn
that
one
simple
lesson
you
pay
for
what
you
get
you
own
what
you
pay
for
and
sooner
or
later
whatever
you
own
comes
back
home
to
you
you
gonna
be
back
this
weekend
though
ain't
you
ricky
lee
asked
through
numbed
lips
in
his
increasing
distress
this
was
all
he
could
find
to
hold
on
to
you
gonna
be
back
this
weekend
just
like
always
ain't
you
don't
know
mr
hanscom
said
and
smiled
a
terrible
smile
t'm
going
a
lot
farther
than
london
this
time
ricky
lee
mr
hanscom
'
you
give
those
cartwheels
to
your
kids
he
repeated
and
slipped
out
into
the
night
what
the
blue
hell
annie
asked
but
ricky
lee
ignored
her
he
flipped
up
the
bar
partition
and
ran
over
to
one
of
the
windows
which
looked
out
on
the
parking
lot
he
saw
the
headlights
of
mr
hanscom
caddy
come
on
heard
the
engine
rev
it
pulled
out
of
the
dirt
lot
kicking
up
a
roostertail
of
dust
behind
it
the
taillights
dwindled
away
to
red
points
down
highway
and
the
nebraska
nightwind
began
to
pull
the
hanging
dust
apart
he
took
on
a
boxcar
full
of
booze
and
you
let
him
get
in
that
big
car
of
his
and
drive
away
annie
said
way
to
go
ricky
lee
never
mind
he
going
to
kill
himself
and
although
this
had
been
ricky
lee
own
thought
less
than
five
minutes
ago
he
turned
to
her
when
the
taillights
winked
out
of
sight
and
shook
his
head
don't
think
so
he
said
although
the
way
he
looked
tonight
it
might
be
better
for
him
if
he
did
what
did
he
say
to
you
he
shook
his
head
it
was
all
confused
in
his
mind
and
the
sum
total
of
it
seemed
to
mean
nothing
it
doesn't
matter
but
i
don't
think
we're
ever
going
to
see
that
old
boy
again
eddie
kaspbrak
takes
his
medicine
if
you
would
know
all
there
is
to
know
about
an
american
man
or
woman
of
the
middle
class
as
the
millennium
nears
is
end
you
would
need
only
to
look
in
his
or
her
medicine
cabinet
or
so
it
has
been
said
but
dear

a
look
into

eddie
kaspbrak
believed
in
the
boy
scout
motto
he
was
swinging
a
blue
totebag
as
he
came
into
the
bathroom
he
set
it
on
the
sink
unzipped
it
and
then
with
trembling
hands
he
began
to
spill
bottles
and
jars
and
tubes
and
squeezebottles
and
spraybottles
into
it
under
other
circumstances
he
would
have
taken
them
out
handful
by
careful
handful
but
there
was
no
time
such
niceties
now
the
choice
as
eddie
saw
it
was
as
simple
as
it
was
brutal
get
moving
and
keep
moving
or
stand
in
one
place
long
enough
to
start
thinking
about
what
all
of
this
meant
and
simply
die
of
fright
eddie
myra
called
up
from
downstairs
eddie
what
are
you
dooooing
eddie
dropped
the
sucrets
box
containing
the
ludes
into
the
bag
the
medicine
cabinet
was
now
entirely
empty
except
for
myra
midol
and
a
small
almost
usedup
tube
of
blistex
he
paused
for
a
moment
and
then
grabbed
the
blistex
he
started
to
zip
the
bag
closed
debated
and
then
threw
in
the
midol
as
well
she
could
always
buy
more
eddie
from
halfway
up
the
stairs
now
eddie
zipped
the
bag
the
rest
of
the
way
closed
and
then
left
the
bathroom
swinging
it
by
his
side
he
was
a
short
man
with
a
timid
rabbity
sort
of
face
much
of
his
hair
was
gone
what
was
left
grew
in
listless
piebald
patches
the
weight
of
the
bag
pulled
him
noticeably
to
one
side
an
extremely
large
woman
was
climbing
slowly
b
the
second
floor
eddie
could
hear
the
stairs
creak
protestingly
under
her
what
are
you
dooooooooin
eddie
did
not
need
a
shrink
to
tell
him
that
he
had
in
a
sense
married
his
mother
myra
kaspbrak
was
huge
she
had
only
been
big
when
eddie
married
her
five
years
ago
but
he
sometimes
thought
his
subconscious
had
seen
the
potential
for
hugeness
in
her
god
knew
his
own
mother
had
been
a
whopper
and
she
looked
somehow
more
huge
than
ever
as
she
reached
the
secondfloor
landing
she
was
wearng
a
white
nightgown
which
swelled
comberlike
at
bosom
and
hip
her
face
devoid
of
makeup
was
white
and
shiny
she
looked
badly
frightened
i
have
to
go
away
for
awhile
eddie
said
what
do
you
mean
you
have
to
go
away
what
was
that
telephone
call
nothing
he
said
fleeing
abruptly
down
the
hallway
to
their
walkin
closet
he
put
the
totebag
down
opened
the
closet
foldback
door
and
raked
aside
the
halfdozen
identical
black
suits
which
hung
there
as
conspicuous
as
a
thundercloud
among
the
other
more
brightly
colored
clothes
he
always
wore
one
of
the
black
suits
when
he
was
working
he
bent
into
the
closet
smelling
mothballs
and
wool
and
pulled
out
one
of
the
suitcases
from
the
back
he
opened
it
and
began
throwing
clothes
in
her
shadow
fell
over
him
what
this
about
eddie
where
are
you
going
you
tell
me
i
can't
tell
you
she
stood
there
watching
him
trying
to
decide
what
to
say
next
or
what
to
do
the
thought
of
simply
bundling
him
into
the
closet
and
then
standing
with
her
back
against
the
door
until
this
madness
had
passed
crossed
her
mind
but
she
was
unable
to
bring
herself
to
do
it
although
she
certainly
could
have
she
was
three
inches
taller
than
eddie
and
outweighed
him
by
a
hundred
pounds
she
couldn't
think
of
what
to
do
or
say
because
this
was
so
utterly
unlike
him
she
could
not
have
been
any
more
dismayed
and
frightened
if
she
had
walked
into
the
television
room
and
found
their
new
bigscreen
tv
floating
in
the
air
you
can't
go
she
heard
herself
saying
you
promised
you'd
get
me
al
pacino
autograph
it
was
an
absurdity
god
knew
it
was
but
at
this
point
even
an
absurdity
was
better
than
nothing
you'll
still
get
i
eddie
said
you'll
have
to
drive
him
yourself
oh
here
was
a
new
terror
to
join
those
already
circling
in
her
poor
dazzled
head
she
uttered
a
small
scream
i
can'ti
never
you'll
have
to
he
said
he
was
examining
his
shoes
now
there
no
one
else
neither
of
my
uniforms
fit
anymore
they're
too
tight
in
the
tits
have
delores
let
one
of
them
out
he
said
implacably
he
threw
two
pairs
of
shoes
back
found
an
empty
shoebox
and
popped
a
third
pair
into
it
good
black
shoes
plenty
of
use
left
in
them
still
but
looking
just
a
bit
too
worn
to
wear
on
the
job
when
you
drove
rich
people
around
new
york
for
a
living
many
of
them
famous
rich
people
everything
had
to
look
just
right
these
shoes
no
longer
looked
just
right
but
he
supposed
they
would
do
for
where
he
was
going
and
for
whatever
he
might
have
to
do
when
he
got
there
maybe
richie
tozier
would
but
then
the
blackness
threatened
and
he
felt
his
throat
beginning
to
close
up
eddie
realized
with
real
panic
that
he
had
packed
the
whole
damned
drugstore
and
had
left
the
most
important
thing
of
all
his
aspirator
downstairs
on
top
of
the
stereo
cabinet
he
banged
the
suitcase
closed
and
latched
it
he
looked
around
at
myra
who
was
standing
there
in
the
hallway
with
her
hand
pressed
against
the
short
thick
column
of
her
neck
as
if
she
were
the
one
with
the
asthma
she
was
staring
at
him
her
face
full
of
perplexity
and
terror
and
he
might
have
felt
sorry
for
her
if
his
heart
had
not
already
been
so
filled
with
terror
for
himself
what
happened
eddie
who
was
that
on
the
telephone
are
you
in
trouble
you
are
aren't
you
what
kind
of
trouble
are
you
in
he
walked
toward
her
zipperbag
in
one
hand
and
suitcase
in
the
other
standing
more
or
less
straight
now
that
he
was
more
evenly
veighted
she
moved
in
front
of
him
blocking
off
the
stairway
and
at
first
he
thought
she
would
not
give
way
then
when
his
face
was
about
to
crash
into
the
soft
roadblock
of
her
breasts
she
did
give
way
fearfully
as
he
walked
past
never
slowing
she
burst
into
miserable
tears
can't
drive
al
pacino
she
bawled
tu
smash
into
a
stopsign
or
something
i
know
i
will
eddie
i'm
scaaarrre
he
looked
at
the
seth
thomas
clock
on
the
table
by
the
stairs
twenty
past
nine
the
cannedsounding
delta
clerk
had
told
him
he
had
already
missed
the
last
flight
north
to
maine
that
one
had
left
la
guardia
at
eighttwentyfive
he
had
called
amtrak
and
discovered
there
was
a
late
train
to
boston
departing
perm
station
at
eleventhirty
it
would
drop
him
off
at
south
station
where
he
could
take
a
cab
to
the
offices
of
cape
cod
limousine
on
arlington
street
cape
cod
and
eddie
company
royal
crest
had
worked
out
a
useful
and
friendly
reciprocal
arrangement
over
the
years
a
quick
call
to
butch
carrington
in
boston
had
taken
care
of
his
transportation
north
butch
said
he
would
have
a
cadillac
limo
gassed
and
ready
for
him
so
he
would
go
in
style
and
with
no
painintheass
client
sitting
in
the
back
seat
stinking
the
air
up
with
a
big
cigar
and
asking
if
eddie
knew
where
he
could
score
a
broad
or
a
few
grams
of
coke
or
both
going
in
style
all
right
he
thought
only
way
you
could
go
in
more
style
would
be
if
you
were
going
in
a
hearse
but
don't
worry
eddie
that
probably
how
you'll
come
back
if
there
enough
of
you
left
to
pick
up
that
is
eddie
'
ninetwenty
plenty
of
time
to
talk
to
her
plenty
of
time
to
be
kind
ah
but
it
would
have
been
so
much
better
if
this
had
been
her
whist
night
if
he
could
have
just
slipped
out
leaving
a
note
under
one
of
the
magnets
on
the
refrigerator
door
the
refrigerator
door
was
where
he
left
all
his
notes
for
myra
because
there
she
never
missed
them
leaving
that
way
like
a
fugitive
would
not
have
been
good
but
this
was
even
worse
this
was
like
having
to
leave
home
all
over
again
and
that
had
been
so
hard
he'd
had
to
do
it
three
times
sometimes
home
is
where
the
heart
is
eddie
thought
randomly
i
believe
that
old
bobby
frost
said
home
the
place
where
when
you
have
to
go
there
they
have
to
take
you
in
unfortunately
it
also
the
place
where
once
you're
in
there
they
don't
ever
want
to
let
you
out
he
stood
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
forward
motion
temporarily
spent
filled
with
fear
breath
wheezing
noisily
in
and
out
of
the
pinhole
his
throat
had
become
and
regarded
his
weeping
wife
come
on
downstairs
with
me
and
i'll
tell
you
what
i
ca
he
said
eddie
put
his
two
bags
clothes
in
one
medicine
in
the
other
by
the
door
in
the
front
hall
he
emembered
something
else
then
or
rather
the
ghost
of
his
mother
who
had
been
dead
many
years
but
who
still
spoke
frequently
in
his
mind
remembered
for
him
you
know
when
your
feet
get
wet
you
always
get
a
cold
eddie
you're
not
like
other
people
you
have
a
very
weak
system
you
have
to
be
careful
that
why
you
must
always
wear
your
rubbers
when
it
rains
it
rained
a
lot
in
derry
eddie
opened
the
fronthall
closet
got
his
rubbers
off
the
hook
where
they
hung
neatly
in
a
plastic
bag
and
put
them
in
his
clothes
suitcase
that
a
good
boy
eddie
he
and
myra
had
been
watching
tv
when
the
shit
hit
the
fan
eddie
went
into
the
television
room
and
pushed
the
button
which
lowered
the
screen
of
the
muralvision
tv
its
screen
was
so
big
that
it
made
freeman
mcneil
look
like
a
visitor
from
brobdingnag
on
sunday
afternoons
he
picked
up
the
telephone
and
called
a
taxi
the
dispatcher
told
him
it
would
probably
be
fifteen
minutes
eddie
said
that
was
no
problem
he
hung
up
and
grabbed
his
aspirator
off
the
top
of
their
expensive
sony
compactdisc
player
i
spent
fifteen
hundred
bucks
on
a
stateoftheart
sound
system
so
that
myra
wouldn't
miss
a
single
golden
note
on
her
barry
manilow
records
and
her
supremes
greatest
hit
he
thought
and
then
felt
a
flush
of
guilt
that
wasn't
fair
and
he
damn
well
knew
it
myra
would
have
been
just
as
happy
with
her
old
scratchy
records
as
she
was
with
the
new
rpmsized
laser
discs
just
as
she
would
have
been
happy
to
keep
on
living
in
the
little
fourroom
house
in
queens
until
they
were
both
old
and
gray
and
if
the
truth
were
told
there
was
a
little
snow
on
eddie
kaspbrak
mountain
already
he
had
bought
the
luxury
sound
system
for
the
same
reasons
that
he
had
bought
this
low
fieldstone
house
on
long
island
where
the
two
of
them
often
rattled
around
like
the
last
two
peas
in
a
can
because
he
had
been
able
to
and
because
they
were
ways
of
appeasing
the
soft
frightened
often
bewildered
always
implacable
voice
of
his
mother
they
vere
ways
of
saying
i
made
it
ma
look
at
all
this
i
made
it
now
will
you
please
for
christ
sake
shut
up
awhile
eddie
stuffed
the
aspirator
into
his
mouth
and
like
a
man
miming
suicide
pulled
the
trigger
a
cloud
of
awful
licorice
taste
roiled
and
boiled
its
way
down
his
throat
and
eddie
breathed
deeply
he
could
feel
breathing
passages
which
had
almost
closed
start
to
open
up
again
the
tightness
in
his
chest
started
to
ease
and
suddenly
he
heard
voices
in
his
mind
ghostvoices
didn't
you
get
the
note
i
sent
you
i
got
it
mrs

little
small
for
his

but

i

your
family
physician

to

he
confirmed

queen
elizabeth
mrs
kaspbrak
eddie
often
seems
very
well
and
happy
in
his
physicaleducation
classes
he
loves
to
play
games
and
he
runs
quite
fast
in
my
conversation
with
dr
baynes
the
word
psychosomatic
came
up
i
wonder
if
you've
considered
the
possibility
that
that
my
son
is
crazy
is
that
what
you're
trying
to
say
are
you
trying
to
say
that
my
son
is
crazy
no
buthe
delicate
mrs
kaspbrak
my
son
is
very
delicate
mrs
kaspbrak
dr
baynes
confirmed
that
he
could
find
nothing
at
all
physically
wrong
eddie
finished
the
memory
of
that
humiliating
encounter
his
mother
screaming
at
coach
black
in
the
derry
elementary
school
gymnasium
while
he
gasped
and
cringed
at
her
side
and
the
other
kids
huddled
around
one
of
the
baskets
and
watched
had
recurred
to
him
tonight
for
the
first
time
in
years
nor
was
that
the
only
memory
which
mike
hanlon
call
was
going
to
bring
back
he
knew
he
could
feel
many
others
as
bad
or
even
worse
crowding
and
jostling
like
salemad
shoppers
bottlenecked
in
a
departmentstore
doorway
but
soon
the
bottleneck
would
break
and
they
would
be
along
he
was
quite
sure
of
that
and
what
would
they
find
on
sale
his
sanity
could
be
halfprice
smoke
and
water
damage
everything
must
go
nothing
physically
wrong
he
repeated
took
a
deep
shuddery
breath
and
stuffed
the
aspirator
into
his
pocket
eddie
myra
said
please
tell
me
what
all
of
this
is
about
teartracks
shone
on
her
chubby
cheeks
her
hands
twisted
restlessly
together
like
a
pair
of
pink
and
hairless
animals
at
play
once
shortly
before
actually
proposing
marriage
he
had
taken
a
picture
of
myra
which
she
had
given
him
and
had
put
it
next
to
one
of
his
mother
who
had
died
of
congestive
heartfailure
at
the
age
of
sixtyfour
at
the
time
of
her
death
eddie
mother
had
topped
the
scales
at
over
four
hundred
pounds
four
hundred
and
six
to
be
exact
she
had
become
something
nearly
monstrous
by
then
her
body
had
seemed
nothing
more
than
boobs
and
butt
and
belly
all
overtopped
by
her
pasty
perpetually
dismayed
face
but
the
picture
of
her
which
he
put
next
to
myra
picture
had
been
taken
in
two
years
before
he
had
been
born
you
were
a
very
sickly
baby
the
ghostmom
now
whispered
in
his
ear
many
times
we
despaired
of
your
life

in
his
mother
had
been
a
relatively
svelte
one
hundred
and
eighty
pounds
he
had
made
that
comparison
he
supposed
in
a
lastditch
effort
to
stop
himself
from
committing
psychological
incest
he
looked
from
mother
to
myra
and
back
again
to
mother
they
could
have
been
sisters
the
resemblance
was
that
close
eddie
looked
at
the
two
nearly
identical
pictures
and
promised
himself
he
would
not
do
this
crazy
thing
he
knew
that
the
boys
at
work
were
already
making
jokes
about
jack
sprat
and
his
wife
but
they
didn't
know
the
half
of
it
the
jokes
and
snide
remarks
he
could
take
but
did
he
really
want
to
be
a
clown
in
such
a
freudian
circus
as
this
no
he
did
not
he
would
break
it
off
with
myra
he
would
let
her
down
gently
because
she
was
really
very
sweet
and
had
had
even
less
experience
with
men
than
he'd
had
with
women
and
then
after
she
had
finally
sailed
over
the
horizon
of
his
life
he
could
maybe
take
those
tennis
lessons
he'd
been
thinking
of
for
such
a
long
time
eddie
often
seems
very
well
and
happy
in
his
physicaleducation
classes’
or
there
were
the
pool
memberships
they
were
selling
at
the
un
plaza
hotel
eddie
loves
to
play
games
not
to
mention
that
health
club
which
had
opened
up
on
third
avenue
across
from
the
garage
eddie
runs
quite
fast
he
runs
quite
fast
when
you're
not
here
runs
quite
fast
when
there
nobody
around
to
remind
him
of
how
delicate
he
is
and
i
see
in
his
face
mrs
kaspbrak
that
he
knows
even
now
at
the
age
of
nine
he
knows
that
the
biggest
favor
in
the
world
he
could
do
himself
would
be
to
run
fast
in
any
direction
you're
not
going
let
him
go
mrs
kaspbrak
let
him
run
but
in
the
end
he
had
married
myra
anyway
in
the
end
the
old
ways
and
the
old
habits
had
simply
been
too
strong
home
was
the
place
where
when
you
have
to
go
there
they
have
to
chain
you
up
oh
he
might
have
beaten
his
mother
ghost
it
would
have
been
hard
but
he
was
quite
sure
he
could
have
done
that
much
if
that
had
been
all
which
needed
doing
it
was
myra
herself
who
had
ended
up
tipping
the
scales
away
from
independence
myra
had
condemned
him
with
solicitude
had
nailed
him
with
concern
had
chained
him
with
sweetness
myra
like
his
mother
had
reached
the
final
fatal
insight
into
his
character
eddie
was
all
the
more
delicate
because
he
sometimes
suspected
he
was
not
delicate
at
all
eddie
needed
to
be
protected
from
his
own
dim
intimations
of
possible
bravery
on
rainy
days
myra
always
took
his
rubbers
out
of
the
plastic
bag
in
the
closet
and
put
them
by
the
coatrack
next
to
the
door
beside
his
plate
of
unbuttered
wheat
toast
each
morning
was
a
dish
of
what
might
have
been
taken
at
a
casual
glance
for
a
multtcolored
pre
sweetened
children
cereal
but
which
a
closer
look
would
have
reveakd
to
be
a
whole
spectrum
of
vitamins
most
of
which
eddie
had
in
his
medicinebag
right
now
myra
like
mother
under
stood
and
there
had
really
been
no
chance
for
him
as
a
young
unmarried
man
he
had
left
his
mother
three
times
and
returned
home
to
fer
three
times
then
four
years
after
his
mother
had
died
in
the
front
hall
of
her
queens
apartment
blocking
the
front
door
so
completely
with
her
bulk
that
the
medcu
guys
called
by
the
people
downstairs
when
they
heard
the
monstrous
thud
of
mrs
kaspbrak
going
down
for
the
final
count
had
had
to
break
in
through
the
locked
door
between
the
apartment
kitchen
and
the
service
stairwell
he
had
returned
home
for
a
fourth
and
final
time
at
least
he
had
believed
then
it
was
for
the
final
time
home
again
home
again
jiggetyjog
home
again
home
again
with
myra
the
hog
a
hog
she
was
but
she
was
a
sweet
hog
and
he
loved
her
and
there
had
really
been
no
chance
for
him
at
all
she
had
drawn
him
to
her
with
the
fatal
hypnotizing
snake
eye
of
understanding
home
again
forever
he
had
thought
then
but
maybe
i
was
wrong
he
thought
maybe
this
isn't
home
nor
ever
was
maybe
home
is
where
i
have
to
go
tonight
home
is
the
place
where
when
you
go
there
you
have
to
finally
face
the
thing
in
the
dark
he
shuddered
helplessly
as
if
he
had
gone
outside
without
his
rubbers
and
caught
a
terrible
chill
eddie
please
she
was
beginning
to
weep
again
tears
were
her
final
defense
just
as
they
had
always
been
his
mother
the
soft
weapon
which
paralyzes
which
turns
kindness
and
tenderness
into
fatal
chinks
in
one
armor
not
that
he'd
ever
worn
much
armor
anyway
suits
of
armor
did
not
seem
to
fit
him
very
well
tears
had
been
more
than
a
defense
for
his
mother
they
had
been
a
weapon
myra
had
rarely
used
her
own
tears
so
cynically
but
cynically
or
not
he
realized
she
was
trying
to
use
them
that
way
now
and
she
was
succeeding
he
couldn't
let
her
it
would
be
too
easy
to
think
of
how
lonely
it
was
going
to
be
sitting
in
a
seat
on
that
train
as
it
barrelled
north
toward
boston
through
the
darkness
his
suitcase
overhead
and
his
totebag
full
of
nostrums
between
his
feet
the
fear
sitting
on
his
chest
like
a
rancid
vickspack
too
easy
to
let
myra
take
him
upstairs
and
make
love
to
him
with
aspirins
and
an
alcohorub
and
put
him
to
bed
where
they
might
or
might
not
make
a
franker
sort
of
love
but
he
had
promised
promised
myra
listen
to
m
he
said
making
his
voice
purposely
dry
purposely
matter
of
fact
she
looked
at
him
with
her
wet
naked
terrified
eyes
he
thought
he
would
try
now
to
explain
as
best
he
could
he
would
tell
her
atibut
how
mike
hanlon
had
called
and
told
him
that
it
had
started
again
and
yes
he
thought
most
of
the
others
were
coming
but
what
came
out
of
his
mouth
was
much
saner
stuff
go
down
to
the
office
first
thing
in
the
morning
talk
to
phil
tell
him
i
had
to
take
off
and
that
you'll
drive
pacino
eddie
i
just
can't
she
wailed
he
a
big
star
if
i
get
lost
he'll
shout
at
me
i
know
he
will
he'll
shout
they
all
do
when
the
driver
gets
lost
and
and
i'll
cry
there
could
be
an
accident
there
probably
will
be
an
accident
eddie
eddie
you
have
to
stay
home
for
god
sake
stop
i
she
recoiled
from
his
voice
hurt
although
eddie
gripped
his
aspirator
he
would
not
use
it
she
would
see
that
as
a
weakness
one
she
could
use
against
him
dear
god
if
you
are
there
please
believe
me
when
i
say
i
don't
want
to
hurt
myra
i
don't
want
to
cut
her
don't
even
want
to
bruise
her
but
i
promised
we
all
promised
we
swore
in
blood
please
help
me
god
because
i
have
to
do
this
i
hate
it
when
you
shout
at
me
eddie
she
whispered
myra
i
hate
it
when
i
have
to
he
said
and
she
winced
there
you
go
eddie
you
hurt
her
again
why
don't
you
just
punch
her
around
the
room
a
few
times
that
would
probably
be
kinder
and
quicker
suddenly
probably
it
was
the
thought
of
punching
someone
around
the
room
which
caused
the
image
to
come
he
saw
the
face
of
henry
bowers
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
thought
of
bowers
in
years
and
it
did
nothing
for
his
peace
of
mind
nothing
at
all
he
closed
his
eyes
briefly
then
opened
them
ad
said
you
won't
get
lost
and
he
won't
shout
at
you
mr
pacino
is
very
nice
very
understanding
he
had
never
driven
pacino
before
in
his
life
but
contented
himself
with
knowing
that
at
least
the
law
of
averages
was
on
the
side
of
this
lie
according
to
popular
myth
most
celebrities
were
shitheels
but
eddie
had
driven
enough
of
them
to
know
it
usually
wasn't
true
there
were
of
course
exceptions
to
the
rule
and
in
most
cases
the
exceptions
were
real
monstrosities
he
hoped
fervently
for
myra
sake
that
pacino
wasn't
one
of
these
is
he
she
asked
timidly
yes
he
is
how
do
you
know
demetrios
drove
him
two
or
three
times
when
he
worked
at
manhattan
limousine
eddie
said
glibly
he
said
mr
pacino
always
tipped
at
least
fifty
dollars
i
wouldn't
care
if
he
only
tipped
me
fifty
cents
as
long
as
he
didn't
shout
at
me
myra
it
all
as
easy
as
onetwothree
one
you
make
the
pickup
at
the
saint
regis
tomorrow
at
seven
p.m
and
take
him
over
to
the
abc
building
they're
retaping
the
last
act
of
this
play
pacino
in
american
buffalo
i
think
it
called
two
you
take
him
back
to
the
saint
regis
around
eleven
three
you
go
back
to
the
garage
turn
in
the
car
and
sign
the
greensheet
that
all
that
all
you
can
do
it
standing
on
your
head
marty
she
usually
giggled
at
this
pet
name
but
now
she
only
looked
at
him
with
a
painful
childlike
solemnity
what
if
he
wants
to
go
out
to
dinner
instead
of
back
to
the
hotel
or
for
drinks
q
for
dancing
don't
think
he
will
but
if
he
does
you
take
him
if
it
looks
like
he
going
to
party
all
night
you
can
call
phil
thomas
on
the
radiophone
after
midnight
by
then
he'll
have
a
driver
free
to
relieve
you
i'd
never
stick
you
with
something
like
this
in
the
first
place
if
i
had
a
driver
who
was
free
but
i
got
two
guys
out
sick
demetrios
on
vacation
and
everyone
else
booked
up
solid
you'll
be
snug
in
your
own
bed
by
one
in
the
morning
marty
one
in
the
morning
at
the
very
very
latest
i
apple
solutely
guarantee
it
she
didn't
laugh
at
applesolutely
either
he
cleared
his
throat
and
leaned
forward
elbows
on
his
knees
instantly
the
ghostmom
whispered
don't
sit
that
way
eddie
it
bad
for
your
posture
and
it
cramps
your
lungs
you
have
very
delicate
lungs
he
sat
up
straight
again
hardly
aware
he
was
doing
it
this
better
be
the
only
time
i
have
to
drive
she
nearly
moaned
tve
turned
into
such
a
horse
in
the
last
two
years
and
my
uniforms
look
so
bad
now
tt
the
only
time
i
swear
who
called
you
eddie
as
if
on
cue
lights
swept
across
the
wall
a
horn
honked
once
as
the
cab
turned
into
the
driveway
he
felt
a
surge
of
relief
they
had
spent
the
fifteen
minutes
talking
about
pacho
instead
of
derry
and
mike
hanlon
and
henry
bowers
and
that
was
good
good
for
myra
and
good
for
him
as
well
he
did
not
want
to
spend
any
time
thinking
or
talking
about
those
things
until
he
had
to
eddie
stood
up
it
my
cab
she
got
up
so
fast
she
tripped
over
the
hem
of
her
own
nightgown
and
fell
forward
eddie
caught
her
but
for
a
moment
the
issue
was
in
grave
doubt
she
outweighed
him
by
a
hundred
pounds
and
she
was
beginning
to
blubber
again
eddie
you
have
to
tell
me
can't
there
no
time
you
never
kept
anything
from
me
before
eddi
she
wept
and
i'm
not
now
not
really
i
don't
remember
it
all
at
least
not
yet
the
man
who
tailed
was
is
an
old
friend
he
you'll
get
sick
she
said
desperately
following
him
as
he
walked
toward
the
front
hall
again
i
know
you
will
let
me
come
eddie
please
i'll
take
care
of
you
pacino
can
get
a
cab
or
something
it
won't
kill
him
what
do
you
say
okay
her
voice
was
rising
becoming
frantic
and
to
eddie
horror
she
began
to
look
more
and
more
like
his
mother
his
mother
as
she
had

he
was
striding
down
the
hall
to
the
front
door
now
walking
blind
head
down
moving
as
a
man
moves
against
a
high
wind
he
was
wheezing
again
when
he
picked
up
the
bags
each
of
them
seemed
to
weigh
a
hundred
pounds
he
could
feel
her
plump
pink
hands
on
him
touching
exploring
pulling
with
helpless
desire
but
no
real
strength
trying
to
seduce
him
with
her
sweet
tears
of
concern
trying
to
draw
him
back
i'm
not
going
to
make
it
he
thought
desperately
the
asthma
was
worse
now
worse
than
it
had
been
since
he
was
a
kid
he
reached
for
the
doorknob
but
it
seemed
to
be
receding
from
him
receding
into
the
blackness
of
outer
space
if
you
stay
i'll
make
you
a
sourcream
coffeecak
she
babbled
we'll
have
popcorn
i'll
make
your
favorite
turkey

now
and
gibkt
gravy
eddie
please
i'm
scared
you're
scaring
me
so
ba
she
grabbed
his
collar
and
pulled
him
backward
like
a
beefy
cop
putting
the
grab
on
a
suspicious
fellow
who
is
trying
to
flee
with
a
final
fading
effort
eddie
kept
going
and
when
he
was
at
the
absolute
end
of
his
strength
and
ability
to
resist
he
felt
her
grip
trail
away
she
gave
one
final
wail
his
fingers
closed
around
the
doorknob
how
blessedly
cool
it
was
he
pulled
the
door
open
and
saw
a
checker
cab
sitting
out
there
an
ambassador
from
the
land
of
sanity
the
night
was
clear
the
stars
were
bright
and
lucid
he
turned
back
to
myra
whistling
and
wheezing
you
need
to
understand
that
this
isn't
something
i
want
to
do
he
said
if
i
had
a
choice
any
choice
at
all
i
wouldn't
go
please
understand
that
marty
i'm
going
but
i'll
be
coming
back
oh
but
that
felt
like
a
lie
when
how
long
a
week
or
maybe
ten
days
surely
no
longer
than
that
a
week
she
screamed
clutching
at
her
bosom
like
a
diva
in
a
bad
opera
a
week
ten
days
please
eddie
pleeeeeee
marty
stop
okay
just
stop
for
a
wonder
she
did
stopped
and
stood
looking
at
him
with
her
wet
bruised
eyes
not
angry
at
him
only
terrified
for
him
and
coincidentally
for
herself
and
for
perhaps
the
first
time
in
all
the
years
he
had
known
her
he
felt
that
he
could
love
her
safely
was
that
part
of
the
going
away
he
supposed
it
was
no
you
could
flush
the
supposed
he
knew
it
was
already
he
felt
like
something
living
in
the
wrong
end
of
a
telescope
but
it
was
maybe
all
right
was
that
what
he
meant
that
he
had
finally
decided
it
was
all
right
to
love
her
that
it
was
all
right
even
though
she
looked
like
his
mother
when
his
mother
had
been
younger
and
even
though
she
ate
brownies
in
bed
while
watching
hardcastle
and
mccormick
or
falcon
crest
and
the
crumbs
always
got
on
his
side
and
even
though
she
wasn't
all
that
bright
and
even
though
she
understood
and
condoned
his
remedies
in
the
medicine
cabinet
because
she
kept
her
own
in
the
refrigerator
or
was
it
could
it
be
that
these
other
ideas
were
all
things
he
had
considered
in
one
way
or
another
at
one
tune
or
another
during
his
oddly
entwined
lives
as
a
son
and
a
lover
and
a
husband
now
on
the
point
of
leaving
home
for
what
felt
like
the
absolutely
last
time
a
new
possibility
came
to
him
and
startled
wonder
brushed
him
like
the
wing
of
some
large
bird
could
it
be
that
myra
was
even
more
frightened
than
he
was
could
it
be
that
his
mother
had
been
another
derry
memory
came
shooting
up
from
his
subconscious
like
a
balefully
fizzing
firework
there
had
been
a
shoe
store
downtown
on
center
street
the
shoeboat
his
mother
had
taken
him
there
one
day
he
thought
he
could
have
been
no
more
than
five
or
six
and
told
him
to
sit
still
and
be
good
while
she
got
a
pair
of
white
pumps
for
a
wedding
so
he
sat
still
and
was
good
while
his
mother
talked
with
mr
gardener
who
was
one
of
the
shoe
clerks
but
he
was
aly
five
or
maybe
six
and
after
his
mother
had
rejected
the
third
pair
of
white
pumps
mr
gardener
showed
her
eddie
got
bored
and
walked
over
to
the
far
corner
to
look
at
something
he
had
spotted
there
at
first
he
thought
it
was
just
a
big
crate
standng
on
end
when
he
got
closer
he
decided
it
was
some
kind
of
desk
but
it
sure
was
the
kookiest
desk
he
had
ever
seen
it
was
so
narrow
it
was
made
of
bright
polished
wood
with
lots
of
curvy
inlaid
lines
and
carved
doojiggers
in
it
also
there
was
a
little
flight
of
three
stairs
leading
up
to
it
and
he
had
never
seen
a
desk
with
stairs
when
he
got
right
up
to
it
he
saw
that
there
was
a
slot
at
the
bottom
of
the
desk
thing
a
button
on
one
side
and
on
top
of
it
entrancing
was
something
that
looked
exactly
like
captain
video
spacescope
eddie
walked
around
to
the
other
side
and
there
was
a
sign
he
must
have
been
at
least
six
because
he
had
been
able
to
read
it
softly
whispering
each
word
aloud
do
your
shoes
fit
right
check
and
see
he
went
back
around
climbed
the
three
steps
to
the
little
platform
and
then
stuck
his
foot
into
the
slot
at
the
bottom
of
the
shoechecker
did
his
shoes
fit
right
eddie
didn't
know
but
he
was
wild
to
check
and
see
he
socked
his
face
into
the
rubber
faceguard
and
thumbed
the
button
green
light
flooded
his
eyes
eddie
gasped
he
could
see
a
foot
floating
inside
a
shoe
filled
with
green
smoke
he
wiggled
his
toes
and
the
toes
he
was
looking
at
wiggled
right
back
they
were
his
all
right
just
as
he
had
suspected
and
then
he
realized
it
was
not
just
his
toes
he
could
see
he
could
see
his
bones
too
the
bones
in
his
foot
he
crossed
his
great
toe
over
his
second
toe
as
if
sneakily
warding
off
the
consequences
of
telling
a
lie
and
the
eldritch
bones
in
the
scope
made
an
x
that
was
not
white
but
goblin
green
he
could
see
then
his
mother
shrieked
a
rising
sound
of
panic
that
cut
through
the
quiet
shoe
store
like
a
runaway
reaperblade
like
a
firebell
like
doom
on
horseback
he
jerked
his
startled
dismayed
face
out
of
the
viewer
and
saw
her
pelting
toward
him
across
the
store
in
her
stocking
feet
her
dress
flying
out
behind
her
she
knocked
a
chair
over
and
one
of
those
shoemeasuring
things
that
always
tickled
his
feet
went
flying
her
bosom
heaved
her
mouth
was
a
scarlet
o
of
horror
faces
turned
to
follow
her
progress
eddie
get
off
there
she
screamed
get
off
there
those
machines
give
you
cancer
get
off
there
eddie
eddieeeeeee
he
backed
away
as
if
the
machine
had
suddenly
grown
redhot
in
his
startled
panic
he
forgot
the
little
flight
of
stairs
behind
him
his
heels
dropped
over
the
top
one
and
he
stood
there
slowly
falling
backward
his
arms
pinwheeling
wildly
in
a
losing
battle
to
retain
his
departing
balance
and
hadn't
he
thought
with
a
kind
of
mad
joy
i'm
going
to
fall
i'm
going
to
find
out
what
it
feels
like
to
fall
and
bump
my
head
goody
for
me
hadn't
he
thought
that
or
was
it
only
the
man
imposing
his
own
selfserving
adult
ideas
over
whatever
his
child
mind
always
roaring
with
confused
surmises
and
halfperceived
images
images
which
lost
their
sense
in
their
very
brightness
had
thought
or
tried
to
think
either
way
it
was
a
moot
question
he
had
not
fallen
his
mother
had
gotten
there
in
time
his
mother
had
caught
him
he
had
burst
into
tears
but
he
had
not
fallen
everyone
had
been
looking
at
them
he
remembered
that
he
remembered
mr
gardener
picking
up
the
shoemeasuring
thing
and
checking
the
little
sliding
gadgets
on
it
to
make
sure
they
were
still
okay
while
another
clerk
righted
the
fallen
chair
and
then
flapped
his
arms
once
in
amused
disgust
before
putting
on
his
pleasantly
neutral
salesman’s
face
again
mostly
he
remembered
his
mother
wet
cheek
and
her
hot
sour
breath
he
remembered
her
whispering
over
and
over
in
his
ear
don't
you
ever
do
that
again
don't
you
ever
do
that
again
don't
you
ever
it
was
what
his
mother
chanted
to
ward
off
trouble
she
had
chanted
the
same
thing
a
year
earlier
when
she
discovered
the
babysitter
had
taken
eddie
to
the
public
pool
in
derry
park
one
stiflingly
hot
summer
day
this
had
been
when
the
polio
scare
of
the
early
fifties
was
just
beginning
to
wind
down
she
had
dragged
him
out
of
the
pool
telling
him
he
must
never
do
that
never
never
and
all
the
kids
had
looked
as
all
the
clerks
and
customers
were
looking
now
and
her
breath
had
had
that
same
sour
tang
she
dragged
him
out
of
the
shoeboat
shouting
at
the
clerks
that
she
would
see
them
all
in
court
if
there
was
anything
wrong
with
her
boy
eddie
terrified
tears
had
continued
off
and
on
for
the
rest
of
the
morning
and
his
asthma
had
been
particularly
bad
all
day
that
night
he
had
lain
awake
for
hours
past
the
time
he
was
usually
asleep
wondering
exactly
what
cancer
was
if
it
was
worse
than
polio
if
it
killed
you
how
long
it
took
if
it
did
and
how
bad
it
hurt
before
you
died
he
also
wondered
if
he
would
go
to
hell
afterward
the
threat
had
been
serious
he
knew
that
much
she
had
been
so
scared
that
was
how
he
knew
so
terrified
mart
he
said
across
this
gulf
of
years
would
you
give
me
a
kiss
she
kissed
him
and
hugged
him
so
tightly
while
she
was
doing
it
that
the
bones
in
his
back
groaned
if
we
were
in
water
he
thought
she'd
drown
us
both
don't
be
afraid
he
whispered
in
her
ear
can't
help
i
she
wailed
know
he
said
and
realized
that
even
though
she
was
hugging
him
with
ribbreaking
tightness
his
asthma
had
eased
that
whistling
note
in
his
breathing
was
gone
i
know
marty
the
taxidriver
honked
again
will
you
call
she
asked
him
tremulously
if
i
can
eddie
can't
you
please
tell
me
what
it
is
and
suppose
he
did
how
far
would
it
go
toward
setting
her
mind
at
rest
many
i
got
a
call
from
mike
hanlon
tonight
and
we
talked
for
awhile
but
everything
we
said
boiled
down
to
two
things
tt
started
agai
mike
said
will
you
com
mike
said
and
now
i've
got
a
fever
marty
only
it
a
fever
you
can't
damp
down
with
aspirin
and
i've
got
a
shortness
of
breath
the
goddamned
aspirator
won't
touch
because
that
shortness
of
breath
isn't
in
my
throat
or
my
lungs
it
is
around
my
heart
i'll
come
back
to
you
if
i
can
marty
but
i
feel
like
a
man
standing
at
the
mouth
of
an
old
mineshaft
that
is
full
of
caveins
waiting
to
happen
standing
there
and
saying
goodbye
to
the
daylight
yes
my
yes
that
would
surely
set
her
mind
at
rest
n
he
said
i
guess
i
can't
tell
you
what
it
is
and
before
she
could
say
more
before
she
could
begin
again
eddie
get
out
of
that
taxi
they
give
you
cancer
he
was
striding
away
from
her
faster
and
faster
by
the
time
he
got
to
the
cab
he
was
almost
running
she
was
still
standing
in
the
doorway
when
the
cab
backed
into
the
street
still
standing
there
when
they
started
for
the
city
a
big
black
womanshadow
cut
out
of
the
light
spilling
from
their
house
he
waved
and
thought
she
raised
her
hand
in
return
where
we
headed
tonight
my
friend
the
cabbe
asked
penn
station
eddie
said
and
his
hand
relaxed
on
the
aspirator
his
asthma
had
gone
to
wherever
it
went
to
brood
between
its
assaults
on
his
bronchial
tubes
he
felt
almost
well
but
he
needed
the
aspirator
worse
than
ever
four
hours
later
coming
out
of
a
light
doze
all
in
a
single
spasmodic
jerk
that
caused
the
fellow
in
the
business
suit
across
the
way
to
lower
his
paper
and
look
at
him
with
faintly
apprehensive
curiosity
i'm
back
eddie
the
asthma
yelled
gleefully
i'm
back
and
oh
i
dunno
this
time
i
just
might
killya
why
not
gotta
do
it
sometime
you
know
can't
fuck
around
with
you
forever
eddie
chest
surged
and
pulled
he
groped
for
the
aspirator
found
it
pointed
it
down
his
throat
and
pulled
the
trigger
then
he
sat
back
in
the
tall
amtrak
seat
shivering
waiting
for
relief
thinking
of
the
dream
from
which
he
had
just
awakened
dream
christ
if
that
was
all
he
was
afraid
it
was
more
memory
than
dream
in
it
there
had
been
a
green
light
like
the
light
inside
a
shoestore
xray
machine
and
a
rotting
leper
had
pursued
a
screaming
boy
named
eddie
kaspbrak
through
tunnels
under
the
earth
he
ran
and
ran
he
runs
quite
fast
coach
black
had
told
his
mother
and
he
ran
plenty
fast
with
that
rotting
thing
after
him
oh
yes
you
better
believe
it
you
bet
your
fur
in
this
dream
where
he
was
eleven
years
old
and
then
he
had
smelled
something
like
the
death
of
time
and
someone
lit
a
match
and
he
had
looked
down
and
seen
the
decomposing
face
of
a
boy
named
patrick
hockstetter
a
boy
who
had
disappeared
in
july
of
and
there
were
worms
crawling
in
and
out
of
patrick
hockstetter
cheeks
and
that
gassy
awful
smell
was
coming
from
inside
of
patrick
hockstetter
and
in
that
dream
that
was
more
memory
than
dream
he
had
looked
to
one
side
and
had
seen
two
schoolbooks
that
were
fat
with
moisture
and
overgrown
with
green
mold
roads
to
everywhere
and
understanding
our
america
they
were
in
their
current
condition
because
it
was
a
foul
wetness
down
here
‘how
i
spent
my
summer
vacation
a
theme
by
patrick
hockstetter
spent
it
dead
in
a
tunnel
moss
grew
on
my
books
and
they
swelled
up
to
the
size
of
sears
catalogues'
eddie
opened
his
mouth
to
scream
and
that
was
when
the
scabrous
fingers
of
the
leper
clittered
around
his
cheek
and
plunged
themselves
into
his
mouth
and
that
was
when
he
woke
up
with
that
backsnapping
jerk
to
find
himself
not
in
the
sewers
under
derry
maine
but
in
an
amtrak
clubcar
near
the
head
of
a
train
speeding
across
rhode
island
under
a
big
white
moon
the
man
across
the
aisle
hesitated
almost
thought
better
of
speaking
and
then
did
are
you
all
right
sir
oh
yes
eddie
said
i
fell
asleep
and
had
a
bad
dream
it
got
my
asthma
going
it
see
the
paper
went
up
gain
eddie
saw
it
was
the
paper
his
mother
had
sometimes
referred
to
as
the
jew
york
times
eddie
looked
out
the
window
at
a
sleeping
landscape
litten
only
by
the
fairy
moon
here
and
there
were
houses
or
sometimes
clusters
of
them
most
dark
a
few
showing
lights
but
the
lights
seemed
little
and
falsely
mocking
compared
to
the
moon
ghostglow
he
thought
the
moon
talked
to
him
he
thought
suddenly
henry
bowers
god
he
was
so
crazy
he
wondered
where
henry
bowers
was
now
dead
in
prison
difting
across
empty
plains
somewhere
in
the
middle
of
the
country
like
an
incurable
virus
sticking
up
seven
elevens
in
the
deep
slumbrous
hours
between
one
and
four
in
the
morning
or
maybe
killing
some
of
the
people
stupid
enough
to
slow
down
for
his
cocked
thumb
in
order
to
transfer
the
dollars
in
their
wallets
to
his
own
possible
possible
in
a
state
asylum
somewhere
looking
up
at
this
moon
which
was
approaching
the
full
talking
to
it
listening
to
answers
which
only
he
could
hear
eddie
considered
this
somehow
even
more
possible
he
shivered
z
am
remembering
my
boyhood
at
last
he
thought
i
am
remembering
how
i
spent
my
own
summer
vacation
in
that
dim
dead
year
of
he
sensed
that
now
he
could
fix
upon
almost
any
scene
from
that
summer
he
wanted
to
but
he
did
not
want
to
oh
god
if
i
could
only
forget
it
all
again
he
leaned
his
forehead
against
the
dirty
glass
of
the
window
his
aspirator
clasped
loosely
in
one
hand
like
a
religious
artifact
watching
as
the
night
flew
apart
around
the
train
going
north
he
thought
but
that
was
wrong
not
going
north
because
it
not
a
train
it
a
time
machine
not
north
back
back
in
time
he
thought
he
heard
the
moon
mutter
eddie
kaspbrak
held
his
aspirator
tightly
and
closed
his
eyes
against
sudden
vertigo
beverly
rogan
takes
a
whuppin
tom
was
nearly
asleep
when
the
phone
rang
he
struggled
halfway
up
leaning
toward
it
and
then
felt
one
of
beverly
breasts
press
against
his
shoulder
as
she
reached
over
him
òo
get
it
he
flopped
back
on
his
pillow
wondering
dully
who
was
calling
on
their
unlisted
home
phone
number
at
this
hour
of
the
night
he
heard
beverly
say
hello
and
then
he
drifted
off
again
he
had
put
away
nearly
three
sixpacks
during
the
baseball
game
and
he
was
shagged
then
beverly
voice
sharp
and
curious
whaaa
drilled
into
his
ear
like
an
icepick
and
he
opened
his
eyes
again
he
tried
to
sit
up
and
the
phone
cord
dug
into
his
thick
neck
get
that
fucking
thing
off
me
beverly
he
said
and
she
got
up
quickly
and
walked
around
the
bed
holding
the
phone
cord
up
with
tented
fingers
her
hair
was
a
deep
red
and
it
flowed
over
her
nightgown
in
natural
waves
almost
to
her
waist
whore
hair
her
eyes
did
not
stutter
to
his
face
to
read
the
emotional
weather
there
and
tom
rogan
didn't
like
that
he
sat
up
his
head
was
starting
to
ache
shit
it
had
probably
already
been
aching
but
when
you
were
asleep
you
didn't
know
it
he
went
into
the
bathroom
urinated
for
what
felt
like
three
hours
and
then
decided
that
as
long
as
he
was
up
he
ought
to
get
another
beer
and
try
to
take
the
curse
off
the
impending
hangover
passing
back
through
the
bedroom
on
his
way
to
the
stairs
a
man
in
white
boxer
shorts
that
flapped
like
sails
below
his
considerable
belly
his
arms
like
slabs
he
looked
more
like
a
dockwalloper
than
the
president
and
general
manager
of
beverly
fashions
inc.
he
looked
over
his
shoulder
and
yelled
crossly
if
it
that
bull
dyke
lesley
tell
her
to
go
eat
out
some
model
and
let
us
sleep
beverly
glanced
up
briefly
shook
her
head
to
indicate
it
wasn't
lesley
and
then
looked
back
at
the
phone
tom
felt
the
muscles
at
the
back
of
his
neck
tighten
up
it
felt
like
a
dismissal
dismissed
by
milady
mifuckinkdy
this
was
starting
to
look
like
it
might
tum
into
a
situation
it
might
be
that
beverly
needed
a
short
refresher
course
on
who
was
in
charge
around
here
it
was
possible
sometimes
she
did
she
was
a
slow
learner
he
went
downstairs
and
padded
along
the
hall
to
the
kitchen
absently
picking
the
seat
of
his
shorts
out
of
the
crack
of
his
ass
and
opened
the
refrigerator
his
reaching
hand
closed
on
nothing
more
alcoholic
than
a
blue
tupperware
dish
of
leftover
noodles
romanoff
all
the
beer
was
gone
even
the
can
he
kept
way
in
the
back
much
as
he
kept
a
twentydollar
bill
folded
up
behind
his
driver
license
for
emergencies
was
gone
the
game
had
gone
fourteen
innings
and
all
for
nothing
the
white
sox
had
lost
bunch
of
candy
asses
this
year
his
eyes
drifted
to
the
bottles
of
hard
stuff
on
the
glassedin
shelf
over
the
kitchen
bar
and
for
a
moment
he
saw
himself
pouring
a
splash
of
beam
over
a
single
icecube
then
he
walked
back
toward
the
stairs
knowing
that
was
asking
for
even
more
trouble
than
his
head
was
currently
in
he
glanced
at
the
face
of
the
antique
pendulum
clock
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
saw
it
was
past
midnight
this
intelligence
did
nothing
to
improve
his
temper
which
was
never
very
good
even
at
the
best
of
times
he
climbed
the
stairs
with
slow
deliberation
aware
too
aware
of
how
hard
his
heart
was
working
kaboom
kathud
kaboom
kathud
kaboom
kathud
it
made
him
nervous
when
he
could
feel
his
heart
beating
in
his
ears
and
wrists
as
well
as
in
his
chest
sometimes
when
that
happened
he
would
imagine
it
not
as
a
squeezing
and
loosening
organ
but
as
a
big
dial
on
the
left
side
of
his
chest
with
the
needle
edging
ominously
into
the
red
zone
he
did
not
like
that
shit
he
did
not
need
that
shit
what
he
needed
was
a
good
night
sleep
but
the
numb
cunt
he
was
married
to
was
still
on
the
phone
i
understand
that
mike
yes
yeslam...iknow...but
a
longer
pause
bill
denbroug
she
exclaimed
and
that
ice
pick
drilled
into
his
ear
again
he
stood
outside
the
bedroom
door
until
he
got
his
breath
back
now
it
was
kathud
ka
thud
kathud
again
the
booming
had
stopped
he
briefly
imagined
the
needle
edging
out
of
the
red
and
then
willed
the
picture
away
he
was
a
man
for
christ
sake
and
a
damned
good
one
not
a
furnace
with
a
bad
thermostat
he
was
in
great
shape
he
was
iron
and
if
she
needed
to
relearn
that
he
would
be
happy
to
teach
her
he
started
in
then
thought
better
of
it
and
stood
where
le
was
a
moment
longer
listening
to
her
not
particularly
caring
about
who
she
was
talking
to
or
what
she
said
only
listening
to
the
rising
falling
tones
of
her
voice
and
what
he
felt
was
the
old
familiar
dull
rage
he
had
met
her
in
a
downtown
chicago
singles
bar
four
years
ago
conversation
had
been
easy
enough
because
they
both
worked
in
the
standard
brands
building
and
knew
a
few
of
the
same
people
tom
worked
for
king
landry
public
relations
on
fortytwo
beverly
marsh
so
she
had
been
then
was
an
assistant
designer
at
delia
fashions
on
twelve
delia
which
would
later
enjoy
a
modest
vogue
in
the
midwest
catered
to
young
people
delia
skirts
and
blouses
and
shawls
and
slacks
were
sold
largely
to
what
delia
castleman
called
youthstore
and
what
tom
called
headshops
tom
rogan
knew
two
things
about
beverly
marsh
almost
at
once
she
was
desirable
and
she
was
vulnerable
in
less
than
a
month
he
knew
a
third
as
well
she
was
talented
very
talented
in
her
drawings
of
casual
dresses
and
blouses
he
saw
a
moneymachine
of
almost
scary
potential
not
in
the
headshops
though
he
thought
but
did
not
say
at
least
not
then
no
more
bad
lighting
no
more
knockdown
prices
no
more
shitty
displays
somewhere
in
the
back
of
the
store
between
the
dope
paraphernalia
and
the
rockgroup
teeshins
leave
that
shit
for
the
smalltimers
he
had
known
a
great
deal
about
her
before
she
knew
he
had
any
real
interest
in
her
and
that
was
just
the
way
tom
wanted
it
he
had
been
looking
for
someone
like
beverly
marsh
all
his
life
and
he
moved
in
with
the
speed
of
a
lion
making
a
run
at
a
slow
antelope
not
that
her
vulnerability
showed
on
the
surface
you
looked
and
saw
a
gorgeous
woman
slim
but
abundantly
stacked
hips
weren't
so
great
maybe
but
she
had
a
great
ass
and
the
best
set
of
tits
he
had
ever
seen
tom
rogan
was
a
titman
always
had
been
and
tall
girls
almost
always
had
disappointing
tits
they
wore
thin
shirts
and
their
nipples
drove
you
crazy
but
when
you
got
those
thin
shirts
off
you
discovered
that
nipples
were
really
all
they
had
the
tits
themselves
looked
like
the
pulknobs
on
a
bureau
drawer
more
than
a
handful
wasted
his
college
roommate
had
been
fond
of
saying
but
as
far
as
tom
was
concerned
his
college
roommate
had
been
so
full
of
shit
he
squeaked
going
into
a
turn
oh
she
had
been
some
kind
of
finelooking
all
right
with
that
dynamite
body
and
that
gorgeous
fall
of
red
wavy
hair
but
she
was
weak
weak
somehow
it
was
as
if
she
was
sending
out
radio
signals
which
only
he
could
receive
you
could
point
to
certain
things
how
much
she
smoked
but
he
had
almost
cured
her
of
that
the
restless
way
her
eyes
moved
never
quite
meeting
the
eyes
of
whoever
was
talking
to
her
only
touching
them
from
time
to
time
and
then
leaping
nimbly
away
her
habit
of
lightly
rubbing
her
elbows
when
she
was
nervous
the
look
of
her
fingernails
which
were
kept
neat
but
brutally
short
tom
noticed
this
latter
the
first
time
he
met
her
she
picked
up
her
glass
of
white
wine
he
saw
her
nails
and
thought
she
keeps
them
short
like
that
because
she
bites
them
lions
may
not
think
at
least
not
the
way
people
think
but
they
see
and
when
antelopes
start
away
from
a
waterhole
alerted
by
that
dustyrug
scent
of
approaching
death
the
cats
can
observe
which
one
falls
to
the
rear
of
the
pack
maybe
because
it
has
a
lame
leg
maybe
because
it
is
just
naturally
slower
or
maybe
because
its
sense
of
danger
is
less
developed
and
it
might
even
be
possible
that
some
antelopes
and
some
women
want
to
be
brought
down
suddenly
he
heard
a
sound
that
jerked
him
rudely
out
of
these
memories
the
snap
of
her
cigarette
lighter
the
dull
rage
came
again
his
stomach
filled
with
a
heat
which
was
not
entirely
unpleasant
smoking
she
was
smoking
they
had
had
a
few
of
tom
rogan
special
seminars
on
the
subject
and
here
she
was
doing
it
again
she
was
a
slow
learner
all
right
but
a
good
teacher
is
at
his
best
with
slow
learners
yes
she
said
now
uhhuh
all
right
yes
she
listened
then
uttered
a
strange
jagged
laugh
he
had
never
heard
before
two
things
since
you
ask
reserve
me
a
room
and
say
me
a
prayer
yes
okay
uhhuh
me
too
goodnight
she
was
hanging
up
as
he
came
in
he
meant
to
come
in
hard
yelling
at
her
to
put
it
out
put
it
out
now
right
now
but
when
he
saw
her
the
words
died
in
his
throat
he
had
seen
her
like
this
before
but
only
two
or
three
times
once
before
their
first
big
show
once
before
the
first
private
preview
showing
for
national
buyers
and
once
when
they
had
gone
to
new
york
for
the
international
design
awards
she
was
moving
across
the
bedroom
in
long
strides
the
white
lace
nightgown
molded
to
her
body
the
cigarette
clamped
between
her
front
teeth
god
he
hated
the
way
she
looked
with
a
butt
in
her
mouth
sending
back
a
little
white
riband
over
her
left
shoulder
like
smoke
from
a
locomotive
stack
but
it
was
her
face
that
really
gave
him
pause
that
caused
the
planned
shout
to
die
in
his
throat
his
heart
lurched
kabamp
and
he
winced
telling
himself
that
what
he
felt
was
not
fear
but
only
surprise
at
finding
her
this
way
she
was
a
woman
who
really
came
alive
all
the
way
only
when
the
rhythm
of
her
work
spiked
toward
a
climax
each
of
those
remembered
occasions
had
of
course
been
career
related
at
those
tunes
he
had
seen
a
different
woman
from
the
one
he
knew
so
well
a
woman
who
fucked
up
his
sensitive
fearradar
with
wild
bursts
of
static
the
woman
who
came
out
in
times
of
stress
was
strong
but
high
strung
fearless
but
unpredictable
there
was
lots
of
color
in
her
cheeks
now
a
natural
blush
high
on
her
cheekbones
her
eyes
were
wide
and
sparkly
not
a
trace
of
sleep
left
in
them
her
hair
flowed
and
streamed
and
oh
looky
here
friends
and
neighbors
oh
you
just
looky
right
here
is
she
taking
a
suitcase
out
of
the
closet
a
suitcase
by
god
she
is
reserve
me
a
room
say
me
a
prayer
well
she
wasn't
going
to
need
a
room
in
any
hotel
not
in
the
foreseeable
future
because
little
beverly
rogan
was
going
to
be
staying
right
here
at
home
thank
you
very
much
and
taking
her
meals
standing
up
for
the
next
three
or
four
days
but
she
very
well
might
need
a
prayer
or
two
before
he
was
through
with
her
she
tossed
the
suitcase
on
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
then
went
to
her
bureau
she
opened
the
top
drawer
and
pulled
out
two
pairs
of
jeans
and
a
pair
of
cords
tossed
them
into
the
suitcase
back
to
the
bureau
cigarette
streaming
smoke
over
her
shoulder
she
grabbed
a
sweater
a
couple
of
teeshirts
one
of
the
old
ship
n
shore
blouses
that
she
looked
so
stupid
in
but
refused
to
give
up
whoever
had
called
her
sure
hadn't
been
a
jetsetter
this
was
dull
stuff
strictly
jackie
kennedyhyannisportweekend
stuff
not
that
he
cared
about
who
had
called
her
or
where
she
thought
she
was
going
since
she
wasn't
going
anywhere
those
were
not
the
things
which
pecked
steadily
at
his
mind
dull
and
achy
from
too
much
beer
and
not
enough
sleep
it
was
that
cigarette
supposedly
she
had
thrown
them
all
out
but
she
had
held
out
on
him
the
proof
was
clamped
between
her
teeth
right
now
and
because
she
still
had
not
noticed
him
standing
in
the
doorway
he
allowed
himself
the
pleasure
of
remembering
the
two
nights
which
had
assured
him
of
his
complete
control
over
her
i
don't
want
you
to
smoke
around
me
anymore
he
told
her
as
they
headed
home
from
a
party
in
lake
forest
october
that
had
been
j
have
to
choke
that
shit
down
at
parties
and
at
the
office
but
i
don't
have
to
choke
it
down
when
i'm
with
you
you
know
what
it
like
i'm
going
to
tell
you
the
truth
it
unpleasant
but
it
the
truth
ifs
like
having
to
eat
someone
else
snot
he
thought
this
would
bring
some
faint
spark
of
protest
but
she
had
only
looked
at
him
in
her
shy
wantingtoplease
way
her
voice
had
been
low
and
meek
and
obedient
all
tight
tom
pitch
it
then
she
pitched
it
tom
had
been
in
a
good
humor
for
the
rest
of
that
night
a
few
weeks
later
coming
out
of
a
movie
she
unthinkingly
lit
a
cigarette
in
the
lobby
and
puffed
it
as
they
walked
across
the
parking
lot
to
the
car
it
had
been
a
bitter
november
night
the
wind
chopping
like
a
maniac
at
any
exposed
square
inch
of
flesh
it
could
find
tom
remembered
he
had
been
able
to
smell
the
lake
as
you
sometimes
could
on
cold
nights
a
flat
smell
that
was
both
fishy
and
somehow
empty
he
let
her
smoke
the
cigarette
he
even
opened
her
door
for
her
when
they
got
to
the
car
he
got
in
behind
the
wheel
closed
his
own
door
and
then
said
bev
she
took
the
cigarette
out
of
her
mouth
turned
toward
him
inquiring
and
he
unloaded
on
her
pretty
good
his
hard
open
hand
stroking
across
her
cheek
hard
enough
to
make
his
palm
tingle
hard
enough
to
rock
her
head
back
against
the
headrest
her
eyes
widened
with
surprise
and
pain
and
something
else
as
well
her
own
hand
flew
to
her
cheek
to
investigate
the
warmth
and
tingling
numbness
there
she
cried
out
owww
tom
he
looked
at
her
eyes
narrowed
mouth
smiling
casually
completely
alive
ready
to
see
what
would
come
next
how
she
would
react
his
cock
was
stiffening
in
his
pants
but
he
barely
noticed
that
was
for
later
for
now
school
was
in
session
he
replayed
what
had
just
happened
her
face
what
had
that
third
expression
been
there
for
a
bare
instant
and
then
gone
first
the
surprise
then
the
pain
then
the
nostalgia
look
of
a
memory
of
some
memory
it
had
only
been
for
a
moment
he
didn't
think
she
even
knew
it
had
been
there
on
her
face
or
in
her
mind
now
now
it
would
all
be
in
the
first
thing
she
didn't
say
he
knew
that
as
well
as
his
own
name
it
wasn't
you
son
of
a
bitch
it
wasn't
see
you
later
macho
city
it
wasn't
we're
through
tom
she
only
looked
at
him
with
her
wounded
brimming
hazel
eyes
and
said
why
did
you
do
that
then
she
tried
to
say
something
else
and
burst
into
tears
instead
throw
it
out
what
what
tom
her
makeup
was
running
down
her
face
in
muddy
tracks
he
didn't
mind
that
he
kind
of
liked
seeing
her
that
way
it
was
messy
but
there
was
something
sexy
about
it
too
slutty
kind
of
exciting
the
cigarette
throw
it
out
realization
dawning
and
with
it
guilt
i
just
forgot
she
cried
that
all
throw
it
out
bev
or
you're
going
to
get
another
shot
she
rolled
the
window
down
and
pitched
the
cigarette
then
she
turned
back
to
him
her
face
pale
and
scared
and
somehow
serene
you
can't
you
aren't
supposed
to
hit
me
that
a
bad
basis
fora...a
a
lasting
relationship
she
was
trying
to
find
a
tone
an
adult
rhythm
of
speech
and
failing
he
had
regressed
her
he
was
in
this
car
with
a
child
voluptuous
and
sexy
as
hell
but
a
child
can't
and
aren't
are
two
different
things
keed
he
said
he
kept
his
voice
calm
but
inside
he
was
jittering
and
jiving
and
i'll
be
the
one
to
decide
what
constitutes
a
lasting
relationship
and
what
doesn't
if
you
can
live
with
that
fine
if
you
can't
you
can
take
a
walk
i
won't
stop
you
i
might
kick
you
once
in
the
ass
as
a
goingaway
present
but
i
won't
stop
you
it
a
free
country
what
more
can
i
say
maybe
you've
already
said
enough
she
whispered
and
he
hit
her
again
harder
than
the
first
time
because
no
broad
was
ever
going
to
smart
off
to
tom
rogan
he
would
pop
the
queen
of
england
if
she
cracked
smart
to
him
her
cheek
banged
the
padded
dashboard
her
hand
groped
for
the
doorhandle
and
then
fell
away
she
only
crouched
in
the
corner
like
a
rabbit
one
hand
over
her
mouth
her
eyes
large
and
wet
and
frightened
tom
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
and
then
he
got
out
and
walked
around
the
back
of
the
car
he
opened
her
door
his
breath
was
smoke
in
the
black
windy
november
air
and
the
smell
of
the
lake
was
very
clear
you
want
to
get
out
bev
i
saw
you
reaching
for
the
doorhandle
so
i
guess
you
must
want
to
get
out
okay
that
all
right
i
asked
you
to
do
something
and
you
said
you
would
then
you
didn't
so
you
want
to
get
out
come
on
get
out
what
the
fuck
right
get
out
you
want
to
get
out
no
she
whispered
what
i
can't
hear
you
no
i
don't
want
to
get
out
she
said
a
little
louder
what
those
cigarettes
giving
you
emphysema
if
you
can't
talk
i'll
get
you
a
fucking
megaphone
this
is
your
last
chance
beverly
you
speak
up
so
i
can
hear
you
do
you
want
to
get
out
of
this
car
or
do
you
want
to
come
back
with
me
want
to
come
back
with
you
she
said
and
clasped
her
hands
on
her
skirt
like
a
little
girl
she
wouldn't
look
at
him
tears
slipped
down
her
cheeks
all
right
he
said
fine
but
first
you
say
this
for
me
bev
you
say
i
forgot
about
smoking
in
front
of
you
tom
now
she
looked
at
him
her
eyes
wounded
pleading
inarticulate
you
can
make
me
do
this
her
eyes
said
but
please
don't
don't
i
love
you
can't
it
be
over
no
it
could
not
because
that
was
not
the
bottom
of
her
wanting
and
both
of
them
knew
it
say
it
i
forgot
about
smoking
in
front
of
you
tom
good
now
say
t'm
sorry
i'm
sorry
she
repeated
dully
the
cigarette
lay
smoking
on
the
pavement
like
a
cut
piece
of
fuse
people
leaving
the
theater
glanced
over
at
them
the
man
standing
by
the
open
passenger
door
of
a
latemodel
fadeintothewoodwork
vega
the
woman
sitting
inside
her
hands
clasped
primly
in
her
lap
her
head
down
the
domelight
outlining
the
soft
fall
of
her
hair
in
gold
he
crushed
the
cigarette
out
he
smeared
it
against
the
blacktop
now
say
i'll
never
do
it
again
without
your
permission
i'll
never
her
voice
began
to
hitch
never
nnn
say
it
bev
never
ddo
it
again
without
your
ppermission
so
he
had
slammed
the
door
and
gone
back
around
to
the
driver
seat
he
got
behind
the
wheel
and
drove
them
back
to
his
downtown
apartment
neither
of
them
said
a
word
hah
the
relationship
had
been
set
in
the
parking
lot
the
second
half
was
set
forty
minutes
later
in
tom
bed
she
didn't
want
to
make
love
she
said
he
saw
a
different
truth
in
her
eyes
and
the
strutty
cock
of
her
legs
however
and
when
he
got
her
blouse
off
her
nipples
had
been
rock
hard
she
moaned
when
he
brushed
them
and
cried
out
softly
when
he
suckled
first
one
and
then
the
other
kneading
them
restlessly
as
he
did
so
she
grabbed
his
hand
and
thrust
it
between
her
legs
i
thought
you
didn't
want
to
he
said
and
she
had
turned
her
face
away
but
she
did
not
let
go
of
his
hand
and
the
rocking
motion
of
her
hips
actually
speeded
up
he
pushed
her
back
on
the
bed
and
now
he
was
gentle
not
ripping
her
underwear
but
removing
it
with
a
careful
consideration
that
was
almost
prissy
sliding
into
her
was
like
sliding
into
some
exquisite
oil
he
moved
with
her
using
her
but
letting
her
use
him
as
well
and
she
came
the
first
time
almost
at
once
crying
out
and
digging
her
nails
into
his
back
then
they
rocked
together
in
long
slow
strokes
and
somewhere
in
there
he
thought
she
came
again
tom
would
get
close
and
then
he
would
think
of
white
sox
batting
averages
or
who
was
trying
to
undercut
him
for
the
chesley
account
at
work
and
he
would
be
okay
again
then
she
began
to
speed
up
her
rhythm
finally
dissolving
into
an
excited
bucking
he
looked
at
her
face
the
raccoon
ringlets
of
mascara
the
smeared
lipstick
and
he
felt
himself
suddenly
shooting
deliriously
toward
the
edge
she
jerked
her
hips
up
harder
and
harder
there
had
been
no
beergut
between
them
in
those
days
and
their
bellies
clapped
hands
in
a
quickening
beat
near
the
end
she
screamed
and
then
bit
his
shoulder
with
her
small
even
teeth
how
many
times
did
you
come
he
asked
her
after
they
had
showered
she
turned
her
face
away
and
when
she
spoke
her
voice
was
so
low
he
almost
couldn't
hear
her
that
isn't
something
you're
supposed
to
ask
no
who
told
you
that
misterogers
he
took
her
face
in
one
hand
thumb
pressing
deep
into
one
cheek
fingers
pressing
into
the
other
palm
cupping
her
chin
in
between
you
talk
to
tom
he
said
you
hear
me
bev
talk
to
papa
three
she
said
reluctantly
good
he
said
you
can
have
a
cigarette
she
looked
at
him
distrustfully
her
red
hair
spread
over
the
pillows
wearing
nothing
but
a
pair
of
hiphugger
panties
just
looking
at
her
that
way
got
his
motor
turning
over
agan
he
nodded
go
on
he
said
that
all
right
they
had
been
married
in
a
civil
ceremony
three
months
later
two
of
his
friends
had
come
the
only
friend
of
hers
to
attend
had
been
kay
mccall
whom
tom
called
that
titsy
women
lib
bitch
all
of
these
memories
went
through
tom
mind
in
a
space
of
seconds
like
a
speededup
piece
of
film
as
he
stood
in
the
doorway
watching
her
she
had
gone
on
to
the
bottom
drawer
of
what
she
sometimes
called
her
weekend
bureau
and
now
she
was
tossing
underwear
into
the
suitcase
not
the
sort
of
stuff
he
liked
the
slippery
satins
and
smooth
silks
this
was
cotton
stuff
littlegirl
stuff
most
of
it
faded
and
with
little
puffs
of
popped
elastic
on
the
waistbands
a
cotton
nightie
that
looked
like
something
out
of
little
house
on
the
prairie
she
poked
in
the
back
of
this
bottom
drawer
to
see
what
else
might
be
lurking
in
there
tom
rogan
meanwhile
moved
across
the
shag
rug
toward
his
wardrobe
his
feet
were
bare
and
his
passage
noiseless
as
a
puff
of
breeze
it
was
the
cigarette
that
was
what
had
really
gotten
him
mad
it
had
been
a
long
time
since
she
had
forgotten
that
first
lesson
there
had
been
other
lessons
to
learn
since
a
great
many
and
there
had
been
hot
days
when
she
had
worn
longsleeved
blouses
or
even
cardigan
sweaters
buttoned
all
the
way
to
the
neck
gray
days
when
she
had
worn
sunglasses
but
that
first
lesson
had
been
so
sudden
and
fundamental
he
had
forgotten
the
telephone
call
that
had
wakened
him
out
of
his
deepening
sleep
it
was
the
cigarette
if
she
was
smoking
now
then
she
had
forgotten
tom
rogan
temporarily
of
course
only
temporarily
but
even
temporarily
was
too
damned
long
what
might
have
caused
her
to
forget
didn't
matter
such
things
were
not
to
happen
in
his
house
for
any
reason
there
was
a
wide
black
strip
of
leather
hanging
from
a
hook
inside
the
closet
door
there
was
no
buckle
on
it
he
had
removed
that
long
ago
it
was
doubled
over
at
one
end
where
a
buckle
would
have
gone
and
this
doubledover
section
formed
a
loop
into
which
tom
rogan
now
slipped
his
hand
tom
you
been
bad
his
mother
had
sometimes
said
well
sometimes
was
maybe
not
such
a
good
word
maybe
ofte
would
have
been
a
better
one
you
come
here
tommy
i
got
to
give
you
a
whuppin
his
life
as
a
child
had
been
punctuated
by
whuppins
he
had
finally
escaped
to
wichita
state
college
but
apparently
there
was
no
such
thing
as
a
complete
escape
because
he
continued
to
hear
her
voice
in
dreams
come
here
tommy
i
got
to
give
you
a
whuppin
whuppin
he
had
been
the
eldest
of
four
three
months
after
the
youngest
had
been
born
ralph
rogan
had
died
well
die
was
maybe
not
such
a
good
word
maybe
committed
suicide
would
have
been
a
better
way
to
put
it
since
he
had
poured
a
generous
quantity
of
lye
into
a
tumbler
of
gin
and
quaffed
this
devil
brew
while
sitting
on
the
bathroom
hopper
mrs
rogan
had
found
work
at
the
ford
plant
tom
although
only
eleven
became
the
man
of
the
family
and
if
he
screwed
up
if
the
baby
shat
her
didies
after
the
sitter
went
home
and
the
mess
was
still
in
them
when
mom
got
home
if
he
forgot
to
cross
megan
on
the
broad
street
corner
after
her
nursery
school
got
out
and
that
nosy
mrs
gant
saw
if
he
happened
to
be
watching
american
bandstand
while
joey
made
a
mess
in
the
kitchen
if
any
of
those
things
or
a
thousand
others
happened
then
after
the
smaller
children
were
in
bed
the
spanking
stick
would
come
out
and
she
would
call
the
invocation
come
here
tommy
i
got
to
give
you
a
whuppin
better
to
be
the
whupper
than
the
whupped
if
he
had
learned
nothing
else
on
the
great
tollroad
of
life
he
had
learned
that
so
he
flipped
the
loose
end
of
the
belt
over
once
and
pulled
the
loop
snug
then
he
closed
hs
fist
over
it
it
felt
good
it
made
him
feel
like
a
grownup
the
strip
of
leather
hung
from
his
clenched
fist
like
a
dead
blacksnake
his
headache
was
gone
she
had
found
that
one
last
thing
in
the
back
of
the
drawer
an
old
white
cotton
bra
with
gunshell
cups
the
thought
that
this
earlymorning
call
might
have
been
from
a
lover
surfaced
briefly
in
his
mind
and
then
sank
again
that
was
ridiculous
a
woman
going
away
to
meet
her
lover
did
not
pack
her
faded
ship
n
shore
blouses
and
her
cotton
kmart
undies
with
the
pops
and
snarls
in
the
elastic
also
she
wouldn't
dare
beverly
he
said
softly
and
she
turned
at
once
startled
her
eyes
wide
her
long
hair
swinging
the
belt
hesitated
dropped
a
little
he
stared
at
her
feeling
that
little
bloom
of
uneasiness
again
yes
she
had
looked
this
way
before
the
big
shows
and
then
he
hadn't
gotten
in
her
way
understanding
that
she
was
so
filled
with
a
mixture
of
fear
and
competitive
aggressiveness
that
it
was
as
if
her
head
was
full
of
illuminating
gas
a
single
spark
and
she
would
explode
she
had
seen
the
shows
not
as
a
chance
to
split
off
from
delia
fashions
to
make
a
livingor
even
a
fortune
on
her
own
if
that
had
been
all
she
would
have
been
fine
but
if
that
were
all
she
also
would
not
have
been
so
ungodly
talented
she
had
seen
those
shows
as
a
kind
of
superexam
on
which
she
would
be
graded
by
fierce
teachers
what
she
saw
on
those
occasions
was
some
creature
without
a
face
it
had
no
face
but
it
did
have
a
name
authority
all
of
that
wideeyed
nerviness
was
on
her
face
now
but
not
just
there
it
was
all
around
her
an
aura
that
seemed
almost
visible
a
hightension
charge
which
made
her
suddenly
both
more
alluring
and
more
dangerous
than
she
had
seemed
to
him
in
years
he
was
afraid
because
she
was
here
all
here
the
essential
she
as
apart
from
the
she
tom
rogan
wanted
her
to
be
the
she
he
had
made
beverly
looked
shocked
and
frightened
she
also
looked
almost
madly
exhilarated
her
cheeks
glowed
with
hectic
color
yet
there
were
stark
white
patches
below
her
lower
lids
which
looked
almost
like
a
second
pair
of
eyes
her
forehead
glowed
with
a
creamy
resonance
and
the
cigarette
was
still
jutting
out
of
her
mouth
now
at
a
slight
upangle
as
if
she
thought
she
was
goddam
franklin
delano
roosevelt
the
cigarette
just
looking
at
it
caused
dull
fury
to
wash
over
him
again
in
a
green
wave
faintly
far
back
in
his
mind
he
remembered
her
saying
something
to
him
one
night
out
of
the
dark
speaking
in
a
dull
and
listless
voice
someday
you're
going
to
kill
me
tom
do
you
know
that
someday
you're
just
going
to
go
too
far
and
that
will
be
the
end
you'll
snap
he
had
answered
you
do
it
my
way
bev
and
that
day
will
never
come
now
before
the
rage
blotted
out
everything
he
wondered
if
that
day
hadn't
come
after
all
the
cigarette
never
mind
the
call
the
packing
the
weird
look
on
her
face
they
would
deal
with
the
cigarette
then
he
would
fuck
her
then
they
could
discuss
the
rest
by
then
it
might
even
seem
important
to
she
said
tom
i
have
to
you're
smoking
he
said
his
voice
seemed
to
come
from
a
distance
as
if
over
a
pretty
good
radio
looks
like
you
forgot
babe
where
you
been
hiding
them
look
i'll
put
it
out
she
said
and
went
to
the
bathroom
door
she
flipped
the
cigarette
even
from
here
he
could
see
the
teethmarks
driven
deep
into
the
filter
into
the
bowl
of
the
john
fsssss
she
came
back
out
tom
that
was
an
old
friend
an
old
old
friend
i
have
to
shut
up
that
what
you
have
to
do
he
shouted
at
her
just
shut
u
but
the
fear
he
wanted
to
see
the
fear
of
him
was
not
on
her
face
there
was
fear
but
it
had
come
out
of
the
telephone
and
fear
was
not
supposed
to
come
to
beverly
from
that
direction
it
was
almost
as
if
she
didn't
see
the
belt
didn't
see
him
and
tom
felt
a
trickle
of
unease
was
he
here
it
was
a
stupid
question
but
was
he
this
question
was
so
terrible
and
so
elemental
that
for
a
moment
he
felt
in
danger
of
coming
completely
unwrapped
from
the
root
of
himself
and
just
floating
off
like
a
tumbleweed
in
a
high
breeze
then
he
caught
hold
of
himself
he
was
here
all
right
and
that
was
quite
enough
fucking
psychobabble
for
one
night
he
was
here
he
was
tom
rogan
tom
bygod
rogan
and
if
this
dippy
cunt
didn't
straighten
up
and
fly
right
in
the
next
thirty
seconds
or
so
she
was
going
to
look
like
she
got
pushed
out
of
a
fastmoving
boxcar
by
a
mean
railroad
dick
got
to
give
you
a
whuppi
he
said
sorry
about
that
babe
he
had
seen
that
mixture
of
fear
and
aggressiveness
before
yes
now
for
the
first
time
ever
it
flashed
out
at
him
put
that
thing
down
she
said
i
have
to
get
out
to
o'hare
as
fast
as
i
can
are
you
here
tom
are
you
he
pushed
the
thought
away
the
strip
of
leather
which
had
once
been
a
belt
swung
slowly
before
him
like
a
pendulum
his
eyes
flickered
and
then
held
fast
to
her
face
listen
to
me
tom
there
been
some
trouble
back
in
my
home
town
very
bad
trouble
i
had
a
friend
in
those
days
i
guess
he
would
have
been
my
boyfriend
except
we
weren't
quite
old
enough
for
that
he
was
only
an
eleven
yearold
kid
with
a
bad
stutter
back
then
he
a
novelist
now
you
even
read
one
of
his
books
i
think
the
black
rapids
'
she
searched
his
face
but
his
face
gave
no
sign
there
was
only
the
belt
penduluming
back
and
forth
back
and
forth
he
stood
with
his
head
lowered
and
his
stocky
legs
slightly
apart
then
she
ran
her
hand
restlessly
through
her
hair
distractedly
as
if
she
had
many
important
things
to
think
of
and
hadn't
seen
the
belt
at
all
and
that
haunting
awful
question
resurfaced
in
his
head
again
are
you
there
are
you
sure
that
book
laid
around
here
for
weeks
and
i
never
made
the
connection
maybe
i
should
have
but
we're
all
older
and
i
haven't
even
thought
about
derry
in
a
long
long
time
anyway
bill
had
a
brother
george
and
george
was
killed
before
i
really
knew
bill
he
was
murdered
and
then
the
next
summer
but
tom
had
istened
to
enough
craziness
from
within
and
from
without
he
moved
in
on
her
fast
cocking
his
right
arm
back
over
his
shoulder
like
a
man
about
to
throw
a
javelin
the
belt
hissed
a
path
through
the
air
beverly
saw
it
coming
and
tried
to
duck
away
but
ler
right
shoulder
struck
the
bathroom
doorway
and
there
was
a
meaty
whapl
as
the
belt
struck
her
left
forearm
leaving
a
red
weal
gonna
whup
you
tom
repeated
his
voice
was
sane
even
regretful
but
his
teeth
showed
in
a
white
and
frozen
smile
he
wanted
to
see
that
look
in
her
eyes
that
look
of
fear
and
terror
and
shame
that
look
that
said
yes
you're
right
i
deserved
it
that
look
that
said
yes
you're
there
all
right
i
feel
your
presence
then
love
could
come
back
and
that
was
right
and
good
because
he
did
love
her
they
could
even
have
a
discussion
if
she
wanted
it
of
exactly
who
had
called
and
what
all
this
was
about
but
that
must
come
later
for
now
school
was
in
session
the
old
onetwo
first
the
whuppin
then
the
fuckin
sorry
babe
tom
don't
do
th
he
swung
the
belt
sidearm
and
saw
it
lick
around
her
hip
there
was
a
satisfying
snap
as
it
finished
on
her
buttock
and
and
jesus
she
was
grabbing
at
it
she
was
grabbing
at
the
belt
for
a
moment
tom
rogan
was
so
astounded
by
this
unexpected
act
of
insubordination
that
he
almost
lost
his
punisher
would
have
lost
it
except
for
the
loop
which
was
tucked
securely
into
his
fist
he
jerked
it
back
don't
you
ever
try
to
grab
something
away
from
me
he
said
hoarsely
you
hear
me
you
ever
do
that
again
and
you'll
spend
a
month
pissing
raspberry
juice
tom
stop
it
she
said
and
her
very
tone
infuriated
him
she
sounded
like
a
playground
monitor
talking
down
to
a
tantrumy
sixyearold
i
have
to
go
this
is
no
joke
people
are
dead
and
i
made
a
promise
a
long
time
ago
tom
heard
little
of
this
he
bellowed
and
ran
at
her
with
his
head
down
the
belt
swinging
blindly
he
hit
her
with
it
driving
her
away
from
the
doorway
and
along
the
bedroom
wall
he
cocked
his
arm
back
hit
her
cocked
his
arm
back
hit
her
cocked
his
arm
back
hit
her
later
that
morning
he
would
not
be
able
to
raise
the
arm
above
eye
level
until
he
had
swallowed
three
codeine
tablets
but
for
now
he
was
aware
of
nothing
but
the
fact
that
she
was
defying
him
she
had
not
only
been
smoking
she
had
tried
to
grab
the
belt
away
from
him
and
oh
folks
oh
friends
and
neighbors
she
had
asked
for
it
and
he
would
testify
before
the
throne
of
god
almighty
that
she
was
going
to
get
it
he
drove
her
along
the
wall
swinging
the
belt
raining
blows
on
her
her
hands
were
up
to
protect
her
face
but
he
had
a
clear
shot
at
the
rest
of
her
the
belt
made
thick
bull
whip
cracks
in
the
quiet
room
but
she
did
not
scream
as
she
sometimes
did
and
she
did
not
beg
him
to
stop
as
she
usually
did
worst
of
all
she
did
not
cry
as
she
always
did
the
only
sounds
were
the
belt
and
their
breathing
his
heavy
and
hoarse
hers
quick
and
light
she
broke
for
the
bed
and
the
vanity
table
on
her
side
of
it
her
shoulders
were
red
from
the
belt
blows
her
hair
streamed
fire
he
lumbered
after
her
slower
but
big
very
big
he
had
played
squash
until
he
had
popped
an
achilles
tendon
two
years
ago
and
since
then
his
weight
had
gotten
out
of
hand
a
little
bit
or
maybe
a
lot
would
have
been
a
better
way
to
put
it
but
the
muscle
was
still
there
firm
cordage
sheathed
in
the
fat
still
he
was
a
little
alarmed
at
how
out
of
breath
he
was
she
reached
the
vanity
and
he
thought
she
would
crouch
there
or
maybe
try
to
crawl
under
it
instead
she
groped
turned
and
suddenly
the
air
was
full
of
flying
missiles
she
was
throwing
cosmetics
at
him
a
bottle
of
chantilly
struck
him
squarely
between
the
nipples
fell
to
his
feet
shattered
he
was
suddenly
enveloped
in
the
gagging
scent
of
flowers
quit
it
he
roared
quit
it
you
bitch
instead
of
quitting
it
her
hands
flew
along
the
vanity
littered
glass
top
grabbing
whatever
they
found
throwing
it
he
groped
his
chest
where
the
bottle
of
chantilly
had
struck
him
unable
to
believe
she
had
hit
him
with
something
even
as
other
objects
flew
around
him
the
bottle
glass
stopper
had
cut
him
it
was
not
much
of
a
cut
little
more
than
a
triangular
scratch
but
was
there
a
certain
redhaired
lady
who
was
going
to
see
the
sun
come
up
from
a
hospital
bed
oh
yes
there
was
a
certain
lady
who
a
jar
of
cream
struck
him
above
the
right
eyebrow
with
sudden
cracking
force
he
heard
a
dull
thud
seemingly
inside
his
head
white
light
exploded
over
that
eye
field
of
vision
and
he
fell
back
a
step
mouth
dropping
open
now
a
tube
of
nivea
cream
struck
his
belly
with
a
small
slapping
sound
and
she
was
was
she
was
it
possible
yes
she
was
yelling
at
him
t'm
going
to
the
airport
you
son
of
a
bitch
do
you
hear
me
i
have
business
and
i'm
going
you
want
to
get
out
of
my
way
because
i'm
going
blood
ran
into
his
right
eye
stinging
and
hot
he
knuckled
it
away
he
stood
there
for
a
moment
staring
at
her
as
if
he
had
never
seen
her
before
in
a
way
he
never
had
her
breasts
heaved
rapidly
her
face
all
flush
and
livid
pallor
blazed
her
lips
were
drawn
back
from
her
teeth
in
a
snarl
she
had
however
denuded
the
top
of
the
vanity
table
the
missile
silo
was
empty
he
could
still
read
the
fear
in
her
eyes
but
it
was
still
not
fear
of
him
you
put
those
clothes
back
he
said
struggling
not
to
pant
as
he
spoke
that
would
not
sound
good
that
would
sound
weak
then
you
put
the
suitcase
back
and
get
into
bed
and
if
you
do
those
things
maybe
i
won't
beat
you
up
too
bad
maybe
you'll
be
able
to
go
out
of
the
house
in
two
days
instead
of
two
weeks
tom
listen
to
me
she
spoke
slowly
her
gaze
was
very
clear
if
you
come
near
me
again
i'll
kill
you
do
you
understand
that
you
tub
of
guts
i'll
kill
you
and
suddenly
maybe
it
was
because
of
the
utter
loathing
on
her
face
the
contempt
maybe
because
she
had
called
him
a
tub
of
guts
or
maybe
only
because
of
the
rebellious
way
her
breasts
rose
and
fell
the
fear
was
suffocating
him
it
was
not
a
bud
or
a
bloom
but
a
whole
goddam
garden
the
fear
the
horrible
fear
that
he
was
not
here
tom
rogan
rushed
at
his
wife
not
bellowing
this
time
he
came
as
silently
as
a
torpedo
cutting
through
the
water
his
intent
now
was
probably
not
merely
to
beat
and
subjugate
but
to
do
to
her
what
she
had
so
rashly
said
she
would
do
to
him
he
thought
she
would
run
probably
for
the
bathroom
maybe
for
the
stairs
instead
she
stood
her
ground
her
hip
whacked
the
wall
as
she
threw
her
weight
against
the
vanity
table
pushing
it
up
and
toward
him
ripping
two
fingernails
down
to
the
quick
when
the
sweat
on
her
palms
caused
her
hands
to
slip
for
a
moment
the
table
tottered
on
an
angle
and
then
she
shoved
herself
forward
again
the
vanity
waltzed
on
one
leg
mirror
catching
the
light
and
reflecting
a
brief
swimmy
aquarium
shadow
across
the
ceiling
and
then
it
tilted
forward
and
outward
its
leading
edge
slammed
into
tom
upper
thighs
and
knocked
him
over
there
was
a
musical
jingle
as
bottles
tipped
over
and
shattered
inside
he
saw
the
mirror
strike
the
floor
on
his
left
and
threw
an
arm
up
to
shield
his
eyes
losing
the
belt
glass
coughed
across
the
floor
silver
on
the
back
he
felt
some
of
it
sting
him
drawing
blood
now
she
was
crying
her
breath
coming
in
high
screamy
sobs
time
after
time
she
had
seen
herself
leaving
him
leaving
tom
tyranny
as
she
had
left
that
of
her
father
stealing
away
in
the
night
bags
piled
in
the
trunk
of
her
cutlass
she
was
not
a
stupid
woman
certainly
not
stupid
enough
even
now
standing
on
the
rim
of
this
incredible
shambles
to
believe
that
she
had
not
loved
tom
and
did
not
in
some
way
love
him
still
but
that
did
not
preclude
her
fear
of
him
her
hate
of
him
and
her
contempt
of
herself
for
choosing
him
for
dim
reasons
buried
in
the
times
that
should
be
over
her
heart
was
not
breaking
it
seemed
rather
to
be
broiling
in
her
chest
melting
she
was
afraid
the
heat
from
her
heart
might
soon
destroy
her
sanity
in
fire
but
above
all
this
yammering
steadily
in
the
back
of
her
mind
she
could
hear
mike
hanlon
dry
steady
voice
it
come
back
beverly
it
come
back
and
you
promised
the
vanity
heaved
up
and
down
once
twice
a
third
time
it
looked
as
if
it
were
breathing
moving
with
careful
agility
her
mouth
turned
down
at
the
comers
and
jerking
as
if
in
prelude
to
some
sort
of
convulsion
she
skirted
the
vanity
toestepping
through
the
broken
glass
and
grabbed
the
belt
just
as
tom
heaved
the
vanity
off
to
one
side
then
she
backed
up
sliding
her
hand
into
the
loop
she
shook
her
hair
out
of
her
eyes
and
watched
to
see
what
he
would
do
tom
got
up
some
of
the
mirrorglass
had
cut
one
of
his
cheeks
a
diagonal
cut
traced
a
line
as
fine
as
thread
across
his
brow
he
squinted
at
her
as
he
rose
slowly
to
his
feet
and
she
saw
drops
of
blood
on
his
boxer
shorts
you
just
give
me
that
belt
he
said
instead
she
took
two
turns
of
it
around
her
hand
and
looked
at
him
defiantly
quit
it
bev
right
now
if
you
come
for
me
i'm
going
to
strap
the
shit
out
of
you
the
words
were
coming
out
of
her
mouth
but
she
couldn't
believe
it
was
her
saying
them
and
just
who
was
this
caveman
in
the
bloody
undershorts
anyway
her
husband
her
father
the
lover
she
had
taken
in
college
who
had
broken
her
nose
one
night
apparently
on
a
whim
oh
god
help
me
she
thought
god
help
me
now
and
still
her
mouth
went
on
i
can
do
it
too
you're
fat
and
slow
tom
i'm
going
and
i
think
maybe
i'll
stay
gone
i
think
maybe
it
over
who
this
guy
denbrough
forget
it
i
was
she
realized
almost
too
late
that
the
question
had
been
a
distraction
he
was
coming
for
her
before
the
last
word
was
out
of
his
mouth
she
whickered
the
belt
through
the
air
in
an
arc
and
the
sound
it
made
when
it
smashed
across
his
mouth
was
the
sound
of
a
stubborn
cork
coming
out
of
a
bottle
he
squealed
and
clapped
his
hands
to
his
mouth
his
eyes
huge
hurt
and
shocked
blood
began
to
pour
between
his
fingers
and
over
the
backs
of
his
hands
you
broke
my
mouth
you
bitch
he
screamed
muffled
ah
god
you
broke
my
mouth”
he
came
at
her
again
hands
reaching
his
mouth
a
wet
red
smear
his
lips
appeared
to
have
burst
in
two
places
the
crown
had
been
knocked
from
one
of
his
front
teeth
as
she
watched
he
spit
it
to
one
side
part
of
her
was
backing
away
from
this
scene
sick
and
moaning
wanting
to
shut
her
eyes
but
that
other
beverly
felt
the
exultation
of
a
deathrow
convict
freed
in
a
freak
earthquake
that
beverly
liked
all
of
this
just
fine
j
wish
you'd
swallowed
it
that
one
thought
wish
you'd
choked
on
it
it
was
this
latter
beverly
who
swung
the
belt
for
the
last
time
the
belt
he
had
used
on
her
buttocks
her
legs
her
breasts
the
belt
he
had
used
on
her
times
without
number
over
the
last
four
years
how
many
strokes
you
got
depended
on
how
badly
you'd
screwed
up
tom
comes
home
and
dinner
is
cold
two
with
the
belt
bev
working
late
at
the
studio
and
forgets
to
call
home
three
with
the
belt
oh
hey
look
at
this
beverly
got
another
parking
ticket
one
with
the
belt
across
the
breasts
he
was
good
he
rarely
bruised
it
didn't
even
hurt
that
much
except
for
the
humiliation
that
hurt
and
what
hurt
worse
was
knowing
that
part
of
her
craved
the
hurt
craved
the
humiliation
last
time
pays
for
all
she
thought
and
swung
she
brought
the
belt
in
low
brought
it
in
sidearm
and
it
whacked
across
his
balls
with
a
brisk
yet
heavy
sound
the
sound
of
a
woman
striking
a
rug
with
a
carpet
beater
that
was
all
it
took
all
the
fight
promptly
went
out
of
tom
rogan
he
uttered
a
thin
strengthless
shriek
and
fell
on
his
knees
as
if
to
pray
his
hands
were
between
his
legs
his
head
was
thrown
back
cords
stood
out
on
his
neck
his
mouth
was
a
tragedygrimace
of
pain
his
left
knee
came
down
squarely
on
a
heavy
pointed
hook
of
shattered
perfume
bottle
and
he
rolled
silently
over
on
one
side
like
a
whale
one
hand
left
his
balls
to
grab
his
squirting
knee
the
blood
she
thought
dear
lord
he
bleeding
everywhere
he'll
live
this
new
beverly
the
beverly
who
seemed
to
have
surfaced
at
mike
hanlon
phone
call
replied
coldly
guys
like
him
always
live
you
just
get
the
hell
out
of
here
before
he
decides
he
wants
to
tango
some
more
or
before
he
decides
to
go
down
cellar
and
get
his
winchester
she
backed
away
and
felt
pain
stab
her
foot
as
she
stepped
on
a
chunk
of
glass
from
the
broken
vanity
mirror
she
bent
down
to
grab
the
handle
of
her
suitcase
she
never
took
her
eyes
off
him
she
backed
out
the
door
and
she
backed
down
the
hall
she
was
holding
the
suitcase
in
front
of
her
in
both
hands
and
it
banged
her
shins
as
she
backed
her
cut
foot
printed
bloody
heelprints
when
she
reached
the
stairs
she
turned
around
and
went
down
quickly
not
letting
herself
think
she
suspected
she
had
no
coherent
thoughts
left
inside
anyway
at
least
for
the
time
being
she
felt
a
light
pawing
against
her
leg
and
screamed
she
looked
down
and
saw
it
was
the
end
of
the
belt
it
was
still
wrapped
around
her
hand
in
this
dim
light
it
looked
more
like
a
dead
snake
than
ever
she
threw
it
over
the
bannister
her
face
a
wince
of
disgust
and
saw
it
land
in
an
s
on
the
rug
of
the
downstairs
hallway
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
she
grasped
the
hem
of
her
white
lace
nightgown
crosshanded
and
pulled
it
over
her
head
it
was
bloody
and
she
would
not
wear
it
one
second
longer
no
matter
what
she
tossed
it
aside
and
it
bilowed
onto
the
rubberplant
by
the
doorway
to
the
living
room
like
a
lacy
parachute
she
bent
naked
to
the
suitcase
her
nipples
were
cold
hard
as
bullets
beverly
you
get
your
ass
upstairs
she
gasped
jerked
then
bent
back
to
the
suitcase
if
he
was
strong
enough
to
scream
that
loud
her
time
was
a
good
deal
shorter
than
she
had
thought
she
opened
the
case
and
pawed
out
panties
a
blouse
an
old
pair
of
levi
she
jerked
these
on
standing
by
the
door
her
eyes
never
leaving
the
stairs
but
tom
did
not
appear
at
the
top
of
them
he
bawled
her
name
twice
more
and
each
time
she
flinched
away
from
that
sound
her
eyes
hunted
her
lips
pulling
back
from
her
teeth
in
an
unconscious
snarl
she
jabbed
the
buttons
of
the
blouse
through
the
hoks
as
fast
as
she
could
the
top
two
buttons
were
gone
it
was
ironic
how
little
of
her
own
sewing
ever
got
done
and
she
supposed
she
looked
quite
a
bit
like
a
parttime
hooker
looking
for
one
last
quickie
before
calling
it
a
night
but
it
would
have
to
do
tll
kill
you
you
bitch
you
fucking
bitch
she
slammed
the
suitcase
closed
and
latched
it
the
arm
of
a
blouse
poked
out
like
a
tongue
she
looked
around
once
quickly
suspecting
that
she
would
never
see
this
house
again
she
discovered
only
relief
in
the
idea
and
so
opened
the
door
and
let
herself
out
she
was
three
blocks
away
walking
with
no
clear
sense
of
where
she
was
going
when
she
realized
her
feet
were
still
bare
the
one
she
had
cut
the
left
throbbed
dully
she
had
b
get
something
on
her
feet
and
it
was
nearly
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
her
wallet
and
creditcards
were
at
home
she
felt
in
the
pockets
of
the
jeans
and
came
up
with
nothing
but
a
few
puffs
of
lint
she
didn't
have
a
dime
not
so
much
as
a
red
penny
she
looked
around
at
the
residential
neighborhood
she
was
in
nice
homes
manicured
lawns
and
plantings
dark
windows
and
suddenly
she
began
to
laugh
beverly
rogan
sat
on
a
low
stone
wall
her
suitcase
between
her
dirty
feet
and
laughed
the
stars
were
out
and
how
bright
they
were
she
tilted
her
head
back
and
laughed
at
them
that
wild
exhilaration
washing
through
her
again
like
a
tidal
wave
that
lifted
and
carried
and
cleansed
a
force
so
powerful
that
any
conscious
thought
was
lost
only
her
blood
thought
and
its
one
powerful
voice
spoke
to
her
in
some
inarticulate
way
of
desire
although
what
it
was
it
desired
she
neither
knew
nor
cared
it
was
enough
to
feel
that
warmth
filling
her
up
with
its
insistence
desire
she
thought
and
inside
her
that
tidal
wave
of
exhilaration
seemed
to
gather
speed
rushing
her
onward
toward
some
inevitable
crash
she
laughed
at
the
stars
frightened
but
free
her
terror
as
sharp
as
pain
and
as
sweet
as
a
ripe
october
apple
and
when
a
light
came
on
in
an
upstairs
bedroom
of
the
house
this
stone
wall
belonged
to
she
grabbed
the
handle
of
her
suitcase
and
fled
off
into
the
night
still
laughing
bill
denbrough
takes
time
out
leave
audra
repeated
she
looked
at
him
puzzled
a
bit
afraid
and
then
tucked
her
bare
feet
up
and
under
her
the
floor
was
cold
the
whole
cottage
was
cold
come
to
that
the
south
of
england
had
been
experiencing
an
exceptionally
dank
spring
and
more
than
once
on
his
regular
morning
and
evening
walks
bill
denbrough
had
found
himself
thinking
of
maine
thinking
in
a
surprised
vague
way
of
derry
the
cottage
was
supposed
to
have
central
heating
the
ad
had
said
so
and
there
certainly
was
a
furnace
down
there
in
the
tidy
little
basement
tucked
away
in
what
had
once
teen
a
coakbin
but
he
and
audra
had
discovered
early
on
in
the
shoot
that
the
british
idea
of
central
heating
was
not
at
all
the
same
as
the
american
one
it
seemed
the
brits
believed
you
had
central
heating
as
long
as
you
didn't
have
to
piss
away
a
scrim
of
ice
in
the
toilet
bowl
when
you
got
up
in
the
moming
it
was
morning
now
just
quarter
of
eight
bill
had
hung
the
phone
up
five
minutes
ago
bill
you
can't
just
leave
you
know
that
have
to
he
said
there
was
a
hutch
on
the
far
side
of
the
room
he
went
to
it
took
a
bottle
of
glenfiddich
from
the
top
shelf
and
poured
himself
a
drink
some
of
it
slopped
over
the
side
of
the
glass
tuck
he
muttered
who
was
that
on
the
telephone
what
are
you
scared
of
bill
tm
not
scared
oh
your
hands
always
shake
like
that
you
always
have
your
first
drink
before
breakfast
he
came
back
to
his
chair
robe
flapping
around
his
ankles
and
sat
down
he
tried
to
smile
but
it
was
a
poor
effort
and
he
gave
it
up
on
the
telly
the
bbc
announcer
was
wrapping
up
this
morning
batch
of
bad
news
before
going
on
to
last
evening
football
scores
when
they
had
arrived
in
the
small
suburban
village
of
fleet
a
month
before
the
shoot
was
scheduled
to
begin
they
had
both
marvelled
over
the
technical
quality
of
british
television
on
a
good
pye
color
set
it
really
did
look
as
though
you
could
climb
right
inside
more
lines
or
something
bill
had
said
i
don't
know
what
it
is
but
it
great
audra
had
replied
that
was
before
they
discovered
that
much
of
the
programming
consisted
of
american
shows
such
as
dallas
and
endless
british
sports
events
ranging
from
the
arcane
and
boring
champion
dartsthrowing
in
which
all
the
participants
looked
like
hypertensive
sumo
wrestlers
to
the
simply
boring
british
football
was
bad
cricket
was
even
worse
tve
been
thinking
about
home
a
lot
lately
bill
said
and
sipped
his
drink
home
she
said
and
looked
so
honestly
puzzled
that
he
laughed
poor
audra
married
almost
eleven
years
to
the
guy
and
you
don't
know
doodley
squat
about
him
what
do
you
know
about
that
he
laughed
again
and
swallowed
the
rest
of
his
drink
his
laughter
had
a
quality
she
cared
for
as
little
as
seeing
him
with
a
glass
of
scotch
in
his
hand
at
this
hour
of
the
morning
the
laugh
sounded
like
something
that
really
wanted
to
be
a
howl
of
pain
i
wonder
if
any
of
the
others
have
got
husbands
and
wives
who
are
just
finding
out
how
little
they
know
i
suppose
they
must
billy
i
know
that
i
love
you
she
said
for
eleven
years
that
been
enough
i
know
he
smiled
at
her
the
smile
was
sweet
tired
and
scared
please
please
tell
me
what
this
is
about
she
looked
at
him
with
her
lovely
gray
eyes
sitting
there
in
a
tatty
leasedhouse
chair
with
her
feet
curled
beneath
the
hem
of
her
nightgown
a
woman
he
had
loved
married
and
still
loved
he
tried
to
see
through
her
eyes
to
see
what
she
knew
he
tried
to
see
it
as
a
story
he
could
but
he
knew
it
would
never
sell
here
is
a
poor
boy
from
the
state
of
maine
who
goes
to
the
university
on
a
scholarship
all
his
life
he
has
wanted
to
be
a
writer
but
when
he
enrolls
in
the
writing
courses
he
finds
himself
lost
without
a
compass
in
a
strange
and
frightening
land
there
one
guy
who
wants
to
be
updike
there
another
one
who
wants
to
be
a
new
england
version
of
faulkner
only
he
wants
to
write
novels
about
the
grim
lives
of
the
poor
in
blank
verse
there
a
girl
who
admires
joyce
carol
gates
but
feels
that
because
oates
was
mrtured
in
a
sexist
society
she
is
radioactive
in
a
literary
sense
oates
is
unable
to
be
clean
this
girl
says
she
will
be
cleaner
there
the
short
fat
grad
student
who
can't
or
won't
speak
above
a
mutter
this
guy
has
written
a
play
in
which
there
ae
nine
characters
each
of
them
says
only
a
single
word
little
by
little
the
playgoers
realize
that
when
you
put
the
single
words
together
you
come
out
with
war
is
the
tool
of
the
sexist
death
merchants
this
fellow
play
receives
an
a
from
the
man
who
teaches
eh
creative
writing
honors
seminar
this
instructor
has
published
four
books
of
poetry
and
his
master’s
thesis
all
with
the
university
press
he
smokes
pot
and
wears
a
peace
medallion
the
fat
mutterer
play
is
produced
by
a
guerrilla
theater
group
during
the
strike
to
end
the
war
which
shuts
down
the
campus
in
may
of
the
instructor
plays
one
of
the
characters
bill
denbrough
meanwhile
has
written
one
lockedroom
mystery
tale
three
science
fiction
stories
and
several
horror
tales
which
owe
a
great
deal
to
edgar
allan
poe
p
lovecraft
and
richard
matheson
in
later
years
he
will
say
those
stories
resembled
a
mid
s
funeral
hack
equipped
with
a
supercharger
and
painted
dayglo
red
one
of
the
sf
tales
earns
him
a
b
this
is
better
the
instructor
writes
on
the
title
page
in
the
alien
counterstrike
we
see
the
vicious
circle
in
which
violence
begets
violence
i
particularly
liked
the
needlenosed
spacecraft
as
a
symbol
of
sociosexual
incursion
while
this
remains
a
slightly
confused
undertone
throughout
it
is
interesting
all
the
others
do
no
better
than
a
c
finally
he
stands
up
in
class
one
day
after
the
discussion
of
a
sallow
young
woman
vignette
about
a
cow
examination
of
a
discarded
engine
block
in
a
deserted
field
this
may
or
may
not
be
after
a
nuclear
war
has
gone
on
for
seventy
minutes
or
so
the
sallow
girl
who
smokes
one
winston
after
another
and
picks
occasionally
at
the
pimples
which
nestle
in
the
hollows
of
her
temples
insists
that
the
vignette
is
a
sociopolitical
statement
in
the
manner
of
the
early
orwell
most
of
the
class
and
the
instructor
agree
but
still
the
discussion
drones
on
when
bill
stands
up
the
class
looks
at
him
he
is
tail
and
has
a
certain
presence
speaking
carefully
not
stuttering
he
has
not
stuttered
in
better
than
five
years
he
says
don't
understand
this
at
all
i
don't
understand
any
of
this
why
does
a
story
have
to
be
socio
anything
politics
culture
history
aren't
those
natural
ingredients
in
any
story
if
it
told
well
i
mean
he
looks
around
sees
hostile
eyes
and
realizes
dimly
that
they
see
this
as
some
sort
of
attack
maybe
it
even
is
they
are
thinking
he
realizes
that
maybe
there
is
a
sexist
death
merchant
in
their
midst
i
mean
can't
you
guys
just
let
a
story
be
a
story
no
one
replies
silence
spins
out
he
stands
there
looking
from
one
cool
set
of
eyes
to
the
next
the
sallow
girl
chuffs
out
smoke
and
snubs
her
cigarette
in
an
ashtray
she
has
brought
along
in
her
backpack
finally
the
instructor
says
softly
as
if
to
a
child
having
an
inexplicable
tantrum
do
you
believe
william
faulkner
was
just
telling
stories
do
you
believe
shakespeare
was
just
interested
in
making
a
buck
come
now
bill
tell
us
what
you
think
i
think
that
pretty
close
to
the
truth
bill
says
after
a
long
moment
in
which
he
honestly
considers
the
question
and
in
their
eyes
he
reads
a
kind
of
damnation
i
suggest
the
instructor
says
toying
with
his
pen
and
smiling
at
bill
with
halflidded
eyes
that
you
have
a
great
deal
to
learn
the
applause
starts
somewhere
in
the
back
of
the
room
bill
leaves
but
returns
the
next
week
determined
to
stick
with
it
in
the
time
between
he
has
written
a
story
called
the
dark
a
tale
about
a
small
boy
who
discovers
a
monster
in
the
cellar
of
his
house
the
little
boy
faces
it
battles
it
finally
kills
it
he
feels
a
land
of
holy
exaltation
as
he
goes
about
the
business
of
writing
this
story
he
even
feels
that
he
is
not
so
much
felling
the
story
as
he
is
allowing
the
story
to
flow
through
him
at
one
point
he
puts
his
pen
down
and
takes
his
hot
and
aching
hand
out
into
tendegree
december
cold
where
it
nearly
smokes
from
the
temperature
change
he
walks
around
green
cutoff
boots
squeaking
in
the
snow
like
tiny
shuttehinges
which
need
oil
and
his
head
seems
to
bulge
with
the
story
it
is
a
little
scary
the
way
it
needs
to
get
out
he
feels
that
if
it
cannot
escape
by
way
of
his
racing
hand
that
it
will
pop
his
eyes
out
in
its
urgency
to
escape
and
be
concrete
going
to
knock
the
shit
out
of
it
he
confides
to
the
blowing
winter
dark
and
laughs
a
little
a
shaky
laugh
he
is
aware
that
he
has
finally
discovered
how
to
do
just
that
after
ten
years
of
trying
he
has
suddenly
found
the
starter
button
on
the
vast
dead
bulldozer
taking
up
so
much
space
inside
his
head
it
has
started
up
it
is
revving
revving
it
is
nothing
pretty
this
big
machine
it
was
not
made
for
taking
pretty
girls
to
proms
it
is
not
a
status
symbol
it
means
business
it
can
knock
things
down
if
he
isn't
careful
it
will
knock
him
down
he
rushes
inside
and
finishes
the
dar
at
white
heat
writing
until
four
o'clock
in
the
morning
and
finally
falling
asleep
over
his
ringbinder
if
someone
had
suggested
to
him
that
he
was
really
writing
about
his
brother
george
he
would
have
been
surprised
he
has
not
thought
about
george
in
years
or
so
he
honestly
believes
the
story
comes
back
from
the
instructor
with
an
f
slashed
into
the
tide
page
two
words
are
scrawled
beneath
in
capital
letters
pulp
screams
one
crap
screams
the
other
bill
takes
the
fifteenpage
sheaf
of
manuscript
over
to
the
woodstove
and
opens
the
door
he
is
within
a
bare
inch
of
bssing
it
in
when
the
absurdity
of
what
he
is
doing
strikes
him
he
sits
down
in
his
rocking
chair
looks
at
a
grateful
dead
poster
and
starts
to
laugh
pulp
fine
let
it
be
pulp
the
woods
were
full
of
it
let
them
fucking
trees
fall
bill
exclaims
and
laughs
until
tears
spurt
from
his
eyes
and
roll
down
his
face
he
retypes
the
title
page
the
one
with
the
instructor
judgment
on
it
and
sends
it
off
to
a
men
magazine
named
white
tie
although
from
what
bill
can
see
it
really
should
be
titled
naked
girls
who
look
like
drug
users'
yet
his
battered
writer
market
says
they
buy
horror
stories
and
the
two
issues
he
has
bought
down
at
the
local
momandpop
store
have
indeed
contained
four
horror
stories
sandwiched
between
the
naked
girls
and
the
ads
for
dirty
movies
and
potency
pills
one
of
them
by
a
man
named
dennis
etchison
is
actually
quite
good
he
sends
the
dar
off
with
no
real
hopes
he
has
submitted
a
good
many
stories
to
magazines
before
with
nothing
to
show
for
it
but
repction
slips
and
is
flabbergasted
and
delighted
when
the
fiction
editor
of
white
tie
buys
it
for
two
hundred
dollars
payment
on
publication
the
assistant
editor
adds
a
short
note
which
calls
it
the
best
damned
horror
story
since
ray
bradbury
the
jar
he
adds
too
bad
only
about
seventy
people
coast
to
coast
will
read
it
but
bill
denbrough
does
not
care
two
hundred
dollars
he
goes
to
his
advisor
with
a
drop
card
for
eh
his
advisor
initials
it
bill
denbrough
staples
the
drop
card
to
he
assistant
fiction
editor
congratulatory
note
and
tacks
both
to
the
bulletin
board
on
the
creativewriting
instructor
door
in
the
corner
of
the
bulletin
board
he
sees
an
antiwar
cartoon
and
suddenly
as
if
moving
of
its
own
accord
his
fingers
pluck
his
pen
from
his
breast
pocket
and
across
the
cartoon
he
writes
this
jf
fiction
and
politics
ever
really
do
become
interchangeable
i'm
going
to
kill
myself
because
i
won't
know
what
else
to
do
you
see
politics
always
change
stories
never
do
he
pauses
and
then
feeling
a
bit
small
but
unable
to
help
himself
he
adds
j
suggest
you
have
a
lot
to
learn
his
drop
card
comes
back
to
him
in
the
campus
mail
three
days
later
the
instructor
has
initialed
it
on
the
space
marked
grade
at
time
of
drop
the
instructor
has
not
given
him
an
incomplete
or
the
low
c
to
which
his
run
of
grades
at
that
time
would
have
entitled
him
instead
another
f
is
slashed
angrily
across
the
grade
line
below
it
the
instructor
has
written
do
you
think
money
proves
anything
about
anything
denbrough
well
actually
yes
bill
denbrough
says
to
his
empty
apartment
and
once
more
begins
to
laugh
crazily
in
his
senior
year
of
college
he
dares
to
write
a
novel
because
he
has
no
idea
what
he
getting
into
he
escapes
the
experience
scratched
and
frightened
but
alive
and
with
a
manuscript
nearly
five
hundred
pages
long
he
sends
it
out
to
the
viking
press
knowing
that
it
will
be
the
first
of
many
stops
for
his
book
which
is
about
ghosts
but
he
likes
viking
ship
logo
and
that
makes
it
as
good
a
place
to
start
as
any
as
it
turns
out
the
first
stop
is
also
the
last
stop
viking
purchases
the
book
and
for
bill
denbrough
the
fairytale
begins
the
man
who
was
once
known
as
stuttering
bill
has
become
a
success
at
the
age
of
twenty
three
three
years
later
and
three
thousand
miles
from
northern
new
england
he
attains
a
queer
kind
of
celebrity
by
marrying
a
woman
who
is
a
moviestar
and
five
years
his
senior
at
hollywood
church
in
the
pines
the
gossip
columnists
give
it
seven
months
the
only
bet
they
say
is
whether
the
end
will
come
in
a
divorce
or
an
annulment
friends
and
enemies
on
both
sides
of
the
match
feel
about
the
same
the
age
difference
apart
the
disparities
are
startling
he
is
tall
already
balding
already
inclining
a
bit
toward
fat
he
speaks
slowly
in
company
and
at
times
seems
nearly
inarticulate
audra
on
the
other
hand
is
auburmhaired
statuesque
and
gorgeous
she
is
less
like
an
earthly
woman
than
a
creature
from
some
semi
divine
superrace
he
has
been
hired
to
do
the
screenplay
of
his
second
novel
the
black
rapids
mostly
because
the
right
to
do
at
least
the
first
draft
of
the
screenplay
was
an
immutable
condition
of
sale
in
spite
of
his
agent
moans
that
he
was
insane
and
his
draft
has
actually
turned
out
pretty
well
he
has
been
invited
out
to
universal
city
for
further
rewrites
and
production
meetings
his
agent
is
a
small
woman
named
susan
browne
she
is
exactly
five
feet
tall
she
is
violently
energetic
and
even
more
violently
emphatic
don't
do
it
billy
she
tells
him
kiss
it
off
they've
got
a
lot
of
money
tied
up
in
it
and
they'll
get
someone
good
to
do
the
screenplay
maybe
even
goldman
who
william
goldman
the
only
good
wrter
who
ever
went
out
there
and
did
both
what
are
you
talking
about
suze
he
stayed
there
and
he
stayed
good
she
said
the
odds
on
both
are
like
the
odds
on
beating
lung
cancer
it
can
be
done
but
who
wants
to
try
you'll
burn
out
on
sex
and
booze
or
some
of
the
nifty
new
drugs
susan
crazily
fascinating
brown
eyes
sparkle
vehemently
up
at
him
and
if
it
turns
out
to
be
some
meatball
who
gets
the
assignment
instead
of
someone
like
goldman
so
what
the
book
on
the
shelf
there
they
can't
change
a
word
susan
listen
to
me
billy
take
the
money
and
run
you're
young
and
strong
that
what
they
like
you
go
out
there
and
they
will
first
separate
you
from
your
selfrespect
and
then
from
your
ability
to
write
a
straight
line
from
point
a
to
point
b
last
but
not
least
they
will
take
your
testes
you
write
like
a
grownup
but
you're
just
a
kid
with
a
very
high
forehead
[have
to
go
did
someone
just
fart
in
here
she
returns
must
have
because
something
sure
stinks
but
i
do
[have
to
jesu
i
have
to
get
away
from
new
england
he
is
afraid
to
say
what
comes
next
it
like
mouthing
a
curse
but
he
owes
it
to
her
i
have
to
get
away
from
maine
why
for
god
sake
i
don't
know
i
just
do
are
you
telling
me
something
real
billy
or
just
talking
like
a
writer
it
real
they
are
in
bed
together
during
this
conversation
her
breasts
are
small
like
peaches
sweet
like
peaches
he
loves
her
a
lot
although
not
the
way
they
both
know
would
be
a
really
good
way
to
love
she
sits
up
with
a
pool
of
sheet
in
her
lap
and
lights
a
cigarette
she
crying
but
he
doubts
if
she
knows
he
knows
it
just
this
shine
in
her
eyes
it
would
be
tactful
not
to
mention
it
so
he
doesn't
he
doesn't
love
her
in
that
really
good
way
but
he
cares
a
mountain
for
her
go
on
then
she
says
in
a
dry
businesslike
voice
as
she
turns
back
to
him
give
me
a
call
when
you're
ready
and
if
you
still
have
the
strength
i'll
come
ad
pick
up
the
pieces
if
there
are
any
left
the
film
version
of
the
black
rapids
is
called
pit
of
the
black
demon
and
audra
phillips
is
cast
as
the
lead
the
title
is
horrible
but
the
movie
turns
out
to
be
quite
good
and
the
only
part
of
him
he
loses
in
hollywood
is
his
heart
bill
audra
said
again
bringing
him
out
of
these
memories
he
saw
she
had
snapped
off
the
tv
he
glanced
out
the
window
and
saw
fog
nuzzling
against
the
panes
ti
explain
as
much
as
i
ca
he
said
you
deserve
that
but
first
do
two
things
for
me
all
right
fix
yourself
another
cup
of
tea
and
tell
me
what
you
know
about
me
or
what
you
think
you
know
she
looked
at
him
puzzled
and
then
went
to
the
highboy
i
know
you're
from
maine
she
said
making
herself
tea
from
the
breakfast
pot
she
was
not
british
but
just
a
touch
of
clipped
british
had
crept
into
her
voice
a
holdover
from
the
part
she
played
in
attic
room
the
movie
they
had
come
over
here
to
do
it
was
bill
first
original
screenplay
he
had
been
offered
the
directorial
shot
as
well
thank
god
he
had
declined
that
his
leaving
now
would
have
completed
the
job
of
bitching
things
up
he
knew
what
they
would
all
say
the
whole
crew
billy
denbrough
finally
shows
his
true
colors
just
another
fucking
writer
crazier
than
a
shithouse
rat
god
knew
he
felt
crazy
right
about
now
i
know
you
had
a
brother
and
that
you
loved
him
very
much
and
that
he
died
audra
went
on
i
know
that
you
grew
up
in
a
town
called
derry
moved
to
bangor
about
two
years
after
your
brother
died
and
moved
to
portland
when
you
were
fourteen
i
know
your
dad
died
of
lung
cancer
when
you
were
seventeen
and
you
wrote
a
bestseller
while
you
were
still
in
college
paying
your
way
with
a
scholarship
and
a
parttime
job
in
a
textile
mill
that
must
have
seemed
very
strange
to
you
the
change
in
income
in
prospects
she
returned
to
his
side
of
the
room
and
he
saw
it
in
her
face
then
the
realization
of
the
hidden
spaces
between
them
i
know
that
you
wrote
the
black
rapids
a
year
later
and
came
out
to
hollywood
and
the
week
before
shooting
started
on
the
movie
you
met
a
very
mixedup
woman
named
audra
phillips
who
knew
a
little
bit
about
what
you
must
have
been
through
the
crazy
decompression
because
she
had
been
plain
old
audrey
philpott
five
years
before
and
this
woman
was
drowning
audra
don't
her
eyes
were
steady
holding
his
oh
why
not
let
us
tell
the
truth
and
shame
the
devil
i
was
drowning
i
discovered
poppers
two
years
before
i
met
you
and
then
a
year
later
i
discovered
coke
and
that
was
even
better
a
popper
in
the
morning
coke
in
the
afternoon
wine
at
night
a
valium
at
bedtime
audra’s
vitamins
too
many
important
interviews
too
many
good
parts
i
was
so
much
like
a
character
in
a
jacqueline
susann
novel
it
was
hilarious
do
you
know
how
i
think
about
that
time
now
bill
no
she
sipped
her
tea
her
eyes
never
leaving
his
and
grinned
it
was
like
running
on
the
walkway
at
la
international
you
get
it
not
exactly
no
a
moving
belt
she
said
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
long
i
know
the
walkway
he
said
but
i
don't
see
what
you're
you
just
stand
there
and
it
carries
you
all
the
way
to
the
baggageclaim
area
but
if
you
want
you
don't
have
to
just
stand
there
you
can
walk
on
it
or
run
and
it
seems
like
you're
just
doing
your
normal
walk
or
your
normal
jog
or
your
normal
run
or
your
normal
allout
sprint
whatever
because
your
body
forgets
that
what
you're
really
doing
is
topping
the
speed
the
walkway
already
making
that
why
they
have
those
signs
that
say
slow
down
moving
rampway
near
the
end
when
i
met
you
i
felt
as
if
i'd
run
right
off
the
end
of
that
thing
onto
a
floor
that
didn't
move
anymore
there
i
was
my
body
nine
miles
ahead
of
my
feet
you
can't
keep
your
balance
sooner
or
later
you
fall
right
on
your
face
except
i
didn't
because
you
caught
me
she
put
her
tea
aside
and
lit
a
cigarette
her
eyes
never
leaving
him
he
could
only
see
that
her
hands
were
shaking
in
the
minute
jitter
of
the
lighterflame
which
darted
first
to
the
nght
of
the
cigaretteend
and
then
to
the
left
before
finding
it
she
drew
deep
blew
out
a
fast
jet
of
smoke
what
do
i
know
about
you
i
know
you
seemed
to
have
it
all
under
control
i
know
that
you
never
seemed
to
be
in
a
hurry
to
get
to
the
next
drink
or
the
next
meeting
or
the
next
party
you
seemed
confident
that
all
those
things
would
be
there
if
you
wanted
them
you
talked
slow
part
of
it
was
the
maine
drawl
i
guess
but
most
of
it
was
just
you
you
were
the
first
man
i
ever
met
out
there
who
dared
to
talk
slow
i
had
to
slow
down
to
listen
i
looked
at
you
bill
and
i
saw
someone
who
never
ran
on
the
walkway
because
he
knew
it
would
get
him
there
you
seemed
utterly
untouched
by
the
hype
and
hysteria
you
didn't
lease
a
rolls
so
you
could
drive
down
rodeo
drive
on
saturday
afternoon
with
your
own
vanity
plates
on
some
glitzy
rental
company
car
you
didn't
have
a
press
agent
to
plant
items
in
variety
or
the
hollywood
reporter
you'd
never
done
the
carson
show
writers
can't
unless
they
also
do
cardtricks
or
bend
spoons
he
said
smiling
it
like
a
national
law
he
thought
she
would
smile
but
she
didn't
i
know
you
were
there
when
i
needed
you
when
i
came
flying
off
the
end
of
the
walkway
like
o
j
simpson
in
that
old
hertz
ad
maybe
you
saved
me
from
eating
the
wrong
pill
on
top
of
too
much
booze
or
maybe
i
would
have
made
it
out
the
other
side
on
my
own
and
it
all
a
big
dramatization
on
my
part
but
it
doesn't
feel
like
that
not
inside
where
i
am
she
snuffed
the
cigarette
only
two
puffs
gone
i
know
you've
been
there
ever
since
and
i've
been
there
for
you
we're
good
in
bed
that
used
to
seem
like
a
big
deal
to
me
but
we're
also
good
out
of
it
and
now
that
seems
like
a
bigger
deal
i
feel
as
if
i
could
grow
old
with
you
and
still
be
brave
i
know
you
drink
too
much
beer
and
don't
get
enough
exercise
i
know
that
some
nights
you
dream
badly
he
was
startled
nastily
startled
almost
frightened
i
never
dream
she
smiled
so
you
tell
the
interviewers
when
they
ask
where
you
get
your
ideas
but
it
not
true
unless
it
just
indigestion
when
you
start
groaning
in
the
night
and
i
don't
believe
that

do
i
talk
he
asked
cautiously
he
could
remember
no
dreams
no
dreams
at
all
good
or
bad
audra
nodded
sometimes
but
i
can
never
make
out
what
it
is
you
say
and
on
a
couple
of
occasions
you
have
wept
he
looked
at
her
blankly
there
was
a
bad
taste
in
his
mouth
it
trailed
back
along
his
tongue
and
down
his
throat
like
the
taste
of
melted
aspirin
so
now
you
know
how
fear
tastes
he
thought
time
you
found
out
considering
all
you've
written
on
the
subject
he
supposed
it
was
a
taste
he
would
get
used
to
if
he
lived
long
enough
memories
were
suddenly
trying
to
crowd
in
it
was
as
if
a
black
sac
in
his
mind
were
bulging
threatening
to
spew
noxious
dreams
images
up
from
his
subconscbus
and
into
the
mental
field
of
vision
commanded
by
his
rational
waking
mind
and
if
that
happened
all
at
once
it
would
drive
him
mad
he
tried
to
push
them
back
and
succeeded
but
not
before
he
heard
a
voice
it
was
as
if
someone
buried
alive
had
cried
out
from
the
ground
it
was
eddie
kaspbrak
voice
you
saved
my
life
bill
those
big
boys
they
drive
me
bugshit
sometimes
i
think
they
really
want
to
kill
me
your
arms
audra
said
bill
looked
down
at
them
the
flesh
there
had
humped
into
gooseflesh
not
little
bumps
but
huge
white
knobs
like
insect
eggs
they
both
stared
saying
nothing
as
if
looking
at
an
interesting
museum
exhibit
the
goosebumps
slowly
melted
away
in
the
silence
that
followed
audra
said
and
i
know
one
oher
thing
someone
called
you
this
morning
from
the
states
and
said
you
have
to
leave
me
he
got
up
looked
briefly
at
the
liquor
bottles
then
went
into
the
kitchen
and
came
back
with
a
glass
of
orange
juice
he
said
you
know
i
had
a
brother
and
you
know
he
died
but
you
don't
know
he
was
murdered
audra
took
in
a
quick
snatch
of
breath
murdered
oh
bill
why
didn't
you
ever
tell
you
he
laughed
that
barking
sound
again
i
don't
know
what
happened
we
were
living
in
derry
then
there
had
been
a
flood
but
it
was
mostly
over
and
george
was
bored
i
was
sick
in
bed
with
the
flu
he
wanted
me
to
make
him
a
boat
out
of
a
sheet
of
newspaper
i
knew
how
from
daycamp
the
year
before
he
said
he
was
going
to
sail
it
down
the
gutters
on
witcham
street
and
jackson
street
because
they
were
still
full
of
water
so
i
made
him
the
boat
and
he
thanked
me
and
he
went
out
and
that
was
the
last
time
i
ever
saw
my
brother
george
alive
if
i
hadn't
had
the
flu
maybe
i
could
have
saved
him
he
paused
right
palm
rubbing
at
his
left
cheek
as
if
testing
for
beardstubble
his
eyes
magnified
by
the
lenses
of
his
glasses
looked
thoughtful
but
he
was
not
looking
at
her
tt
happened
right
there
on
witcham
street
not
too
far
from
the
intersection
with
jackson
whoever
killed
him
pulled
his
left
arm
off
the
way
a
secondgrader
would
pull
a
wing
off
a
fly
medical
examiner
said
he
either
died
of
shock
or
bloodloss
far
as
i
could
ever
see
it
didn't
make
a
dime
worth
of
difference
which
it
was
christ
bill
i
imagine
you
wonder
why
i
never
told
you
the
truth
is
i
wonder
myself
here
we've
been
married
eleven
years
and
until
today
you
never
knew
what
happened
to
georgie
i
know
about
your
whole
family
even
your
aunts
and
uncles
i
know
your
grandfather
died
in
his
garage
in
iowa
city
frigging
around
with
his
chainsaw
while
he
was
drunk
i
know
those
things
because
married
people
no
matter
how
busy
they
are
get
to
know
almost
everything
after
awhile
and
if
they
get
really
bored
and
stop
listening
they
pick
it
up
anyway
by
osmosis
or
do
you
think
i'm
wrong
n
she
said
faintly
you're
not
wrong
bill
and
we've
always
been
able
to
talk
to
each
other
haven't
we
i
mean
neither
of
us
got
so
bored
it
ever
had
to
be
osmosis
right
well
she
said
until
today
i
always
thought
so
come
on
audra
you
know
everything
that
happened
to
me
over
the
last
eleven
years
of
my
life
every
deal
every
idea
every
cold
every
friend
every
guy
that
ever
did
me
wrong
or
tried
to
you
know
i
slept
with
susan
browne
you
know
that
sometimes
i
get
maudlin
when
i
drink
and
play
the
records
too
loud
especially
the
grateful
dea
she
said
and
he
laughed
this
time
she
smiled
back
you
know
the
most
important
stuff
too
the
things
i
hope
for
yes
i
think
so
but
this
she
paused
shook
her
head
thought
for
a
moment
how
much
does
this
call
have
to
do
with
your
brother
bill
let
me
get
to
it
ia
my
own
way
dont
try
to
rush
me
into
the
center
of
it
or
you'll
have
me
committed
it
so
big
and
so
so
quaintly
awful
that
i'm
trying
to
sort
of
creep
up
on
it
you
see
it
never
occurred
to
me
to
tell
you
about
georgie
she
looked
at
him
frowned
shook
her
head
faintly
i
don't
understand
what
i'm
trying
to
tell
you
audra
is
that
i
haven't
even
thought
of
george
in
twenty
years
or
more
but
you
told
me
you
had
a
brother
named
i
repeated
a
fact
he
said
that
was
all
his
name
was
a
word
it
cast
no
shadow
at
all
in
my
mind
but
i
think
maybe
it
cast
a
shadow
over
your
dreams
audra
said
her
voice
was
very
quiet
the
groaning
the
crying
she
nodded
i
suppose
you
could
be
right
he
said
in
fact
you're
almost
surely
right
but
dreams
you
don't
remember
don't
really
count
do
they
are
you
really
telling
me
you
never
thought
of
him
at
all
yes
i
am
she
shook
her
head
frankly
disbelieving
not
even
the
horrible
way
he
die
not
until
today
audra
she
looked
at
him
and
shook
her
head
again
you
asked
me
before
we
were
married
if
i
had
any
brothers
or
sisters
and
i
said
i
had
a
brother
who
died
when
i
was
a
kid
you
knew
my
parents
were
gone
and
you've
got
so
much
family
that
it
took
up
your
entire
field
of
attention
but
that
not
all
what
do
you
mean
tt
isn't
just
george
that
been
in
that
black
hole
i
haven't
thought
of
derry
itself
in
twenty
years
not
the
people
i
chummed
with
eddie
kaspbrak
and
richie
the
mouth
stan
uris
bev
marsh
he
ran
his
hands
through
his
hair
and
laughed
shakily
it
like
having
a
case
of
amnesia
so
bad
you
don't
know
you've
got
it
and
when
mike
hanlon
called
who
mike
hanlon
another
kid
that
we
chummed
with
that
i
chummed
with
after
georgie
died
of
course
he
no
kid
anymore
none
of
us
are
that
was
mike
on
the
phone
transatlantic
cable
he
said
hello
have
i
reached
the
denbrough
residence
and
i
said
yes
and
he
said
bill
is
that
you
and
i
said
yes
and
he
said
this
is
mike
hanlon
it
meant
nothing
to
me
audra
he
might
as
well
have
been
selling
encyclopedias
or
burl
ives
records
then
he
said
from
derry
and
when
he
said
that
it
was
like
a
door
opened
inside
ne
and
some
horrible
light
shined
out
and
i
remembered
who
he
was
i
remembered
georgie
i
remembered
all
the
others
all
this
happened
bill
snapped
his
fingers
like
that
and
i
knew
he
was
going
to
ask
me
to
come
come
back
to
derry
yeah
he
took
his
glasses
off
rubbed
his
eyes
looked
at
her
never
in
her
life
had
she
seen
a
man
who
looked
so
frightened
back
to
derry
because
we
promised
he
said
and
we
did
we
did
all
of
us
us
kids
we
stood
in
the
creek
that
ran
through
the
barrens
and
we
held
hands
in
a
circle
and
we
had
cut
our
palms
with
a
piece
of
glass
so
it
was
like
a
bunch
of
kids
playing
blood
brothers
only
it
was
real
he
held
his
palms
out
to
her
and
in
the
center
of
each
she
could
see
a
closeset
ladder
of
white
lines
that
could
have
been
scartissue
she
had
held
his
hand
both
his
hands
countless
times
but
she
had
never
noticed
these
scars
across
his
palms
before
they
were
faint
yes
but
she
would
have
believed
and
the
party
that
party
not
the
one
where
they
had
met
although
this
second
one
formed
a
perfect
bookend
to
that
first
one
because
it
had
been
the
wrap
party
at
the
end
of
the
pit
of
the
black
demon
shoot
it
had
been
loud
and
drunk
every
inch
the
topanga
canyon
do
rrhaps
a
little
less
bitchy
than
some
of
the
other
la
parties
she
had
been
to
because
the
shoot
had
gone
better
than
they
had
any
right
to
expect
and
they
all
knew
it
for
audra
phillips
it
had
gone
even
better
because
she
had
fallen
in
love
with
william
denbrough
what
was
the
name
of
the
selfproclaimed
palmist
she
couldn't
remember
now
only
that
she
had
been
one
of
the
makeup
man
two
assistants
she
remembered
the
girl
whipping
off
her
blouse
at
some
point
in
the
party
revealing
a
very
filmy
bra
beneath
and
tying
it
over
her
head
like
a
gypsy
scarf
high
on
pot
and
wine
she
had
read
palms
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
or
at
least
until
she
had
passed
out
audra
could
not
remember
now
if
the
girl
readings
had
been
good
or
bad
witty
or
stupid
she
had
been
pretty
high
herself
that
night
what
she
did
remember
was
that
at
one
point
the
girl
had
grabbed
bill
palm
and
her
own
and
had
declared
them
perfectly
matched
they
were
lifetwins
she
said
she
could
remember
watching
more
than
a
little
jealous
as
the
girl
traced
the
lines
on
his
palm
with
her
exquisitely
lacquered
fingernail
how
stupid
that
was
in
the
weird
la
film
subculture
where
men
patted
women
fannies
as
routinely
as
new
york
men
pecked
their
cheeks
but
there
had
been
something
intimate
and
lingering
about
that
tracery
there
had
been
no
little
white
scars
on
bill
palms
then
she
had
been
watching
the
charade
with
a
jealous
lover
eye
and
she
was
sure
of
the
memory
sure
of
the
fact
she
said
so
to
bill
now
he
nodded
you're
right
they
weren't
there
then
and
although
i
can't
absolutely
swear
to
it
i
don't
think
they
were
there
last
night
down
at
the
plow
and
barrow
ralph
and
i
were
handwrestling
for
beers
again
and
i
think
i
would
have
noticed
he
grinned
at
her
the
grin
was
dry
humorless
and
scared
i
think
they
came
back
when
mike
hanlon
called
that
what
i
think
bill
that
isn't
possible
but
she
reached
for
her
cigarettes
bill
was
looking
at
his
hands
stan
did
it
he
said
cut
our
palms
with
a
sliver
of
coke
bottle
i
can
remember
it
so
clearly
now
he
looked
up
at
audra
and
behind
his
glasses
his
eyes
were
hurt
and
puzzled
i
remember
how
that
piece
of
glass
flashed
in
the
sun
it
was
one
of
the
new
dear
ones
before
that
coke
bottles
used
to
be
green
you
remember
that
she
shook
her
head
but
he
didn't
see
her
he
was
still
studying
his
palms
i
can
remember
stan
doing
his
own
hands
last
pretending
he
was
going
to
slash
his
wrists
instead
of
just
cut
his
palms
a
little
i
guess
it
was
just
some
goof
but
i
almost
made
a
move
on
him
to
stop
him
because
for
a
second
or
two
there
he
looked
serious
bill
don't
she
said
in
a
low
voice
this
time
she
had
to
steady
the
lighter
in
her
right
hand
by
grasping
its
wrist
in
her
left
like
a
policeman
holding
a
gun
on
a
shooting
range
scars
can't
come
back
they
either
are
or
aren't
you
saw
them
before
huh
is
that
what
you're
telling
me
they're
very
faint
audra
said
more
sharply
than
she
had
intended
we
were
all
bleeding
he
said
we
were
standing
in
the
water
not
far
from
where
eddie
kaspbrak
and
ben
hanscom
and
i
built
the
dam
that
time
you
don't
mean
the
architect
do
you
is
there
one
by
that
name
god
bill
he
built
the
new
bbc
communications
center
they're
still
arguing
whether
it
a
dream
or
an
abortion
well
i
don't
know
if
it
the
same
guy
or
not
it
doesn't
seem
likely
but
i
guess
it
could
be
the
ben
i
knew
was
great
at
buildng
stuff
we
all
stood
there
and
i
was
holding
bev
marsh
left
hand
in
my
right
and
richie
tozier
right
hand
in
my
left
we
stood
out
there
in
the
water
like
something
out
of
a
southern
baptism
after
a
tent
meeting
and
i
remember
i
could
see
the
derry
standpipe
on
the
horizon
it
looked
as
white
as
you
imagine
the
robes
of
the
archangels
must
be
and
we
promised
we
swore
that
if
it
wasn't
over
that
if
it
ever
started
to
happen
again
we'd
go
back
and
we'd
do
it
again
and
stop
it
forever
stop
what
she
cried
suddenly
furious
with
him
stop
what
what
the
fuck
are
you
talking
about
i
wish
you
wouldn't
aaask
bill
began
and
then
stopped
she
saw
an
expression
of
bemused
horror
spread
over
his
face
like
a
stain
give
me
a
cigarette
she
passed
him
the
pack
he
lit
one
she
had
never
seen
him
smoke
a
cigarette
i
used
to
stutter
too
you
stuttere
yes
back
then
you
said
i
was
the
only
man
in
la
you
ever
knew
who
dared
to
speak
slowly
the
truth
is
i
didn't
dare
talk
fast
it
wasn't
reflection
it
wasn't
deliberation
it
wasn't
wisdom
all
reformed
stutterers
speak
very
slowly
it
one
of
the
tricks
you
learn
like
thinking
of
your
middle
name
just
before
you
introduce
yourself
because
stutterers
have
more
trouble
with
nouns
than
with
any
other
words
and
the
one
word
in
all
the
world
that
gives
them
the
most
trouble
is
their
own
first
name
stuttered
she
smiled
a
small
smile
as
if
he
had
told
a
joke
and
she
had
missed
the
point
until
georgie
died
i
stuttered
moderately
bill
said
and
already
he
had
begun
to
hear
words
double
in
his
mind
as
if
they
were
infinitesimally
separated
in
time
the
words
came
out
smoothly
in
his
ordinary
slow
and
cadenced
way
but
in
his
mind
he
heard
words
like
georgie
and
moderately
overlap
becoming
juhjuhgeorgie
and
mmoderately
i
mean
i
had
some
really
bad
moments
usually
when
i
was
called
on
in
class
and
especially
if
i
really
knew
the
answer
and
wanted
to
give
it
but
mostly
i
got
by
after
george
died
it
got
a
lot
worse
then
around
the
age
of
fourteen
or
fifteen
things
started
to
get
better
again
i
went
to
chevrus
high
in
portland
and
there
was
a
speech
therapist
there
mrs
thomas
who
was
really
great
she
taught
me
some
good
tricks
like
thinking
of
my
middle
name
just
before
i
said
hi
i'm
bill
denbrough
out
loud
i
was
taking
french
and
she
taught
me
to
switch
to
french
if
i
got
badly
stuck
on
a
word
so
if
you're
standing
there
feeling
like
the
world
grandest
asshole
saying
thththis
buhbuhbuhbuh
over
and
over
like
a
broken
record
you
switched
over
to
french
and
ce
livre
would
come
flowing
off
your
tongue
worked
every
time
and
as
soon
as
you
said
it
in
french
you
could
come
back
to
english
and
say
this
book
with
no
problem
at
all
if
you
got
stuck
on
an
sword
like
ship
or
skate
or
slum
you
could
lisp
it
thip
thkate
thlum
no
stutter
all
of
that
helped
but
mostly
it
was
just
forgetting
derry
and
everything
that
happened
there
because
that
when
the
forgetting
happened
when
we
were
living
in
portland
and
i
was
going
to
chevrus
i
didn't
forget
everything
at
once
but
looking
back
now
i'd
have
to
say
it
happened
over
a
remarkably
short
period
of
time
maybe
no
more
than
four
months
my
stutter
and
my
memories
faded
out
together
someone
washed
the
blackboard
and
all
the
old
equations
went
away
he
drank
what
was
left
of
his
juice
when
i
stuttered
on
ask
a
few
seconds
ago
that
was
the
first
time
in
maybe
twentyone
years
he
looked
at
her
first
the
scars
then
the
stuhhutter
do
you
hhear
it
you're
doing
that
on
purpose
she
said
badly
frightened
no
i
guess
there
no
way
to
convince
a
person
of
that
but
it
true
stuttering
funny
audra
spooky
on
one
level
you're
not
even
aware
it
happening
but
it
also
something
you
can
hear
in
your
mind
it
like
part
of
your
head
is
working
an
instant
ahead
of
the
rest
or
one
of
those
reverb
systems
kids
used
to
put
in
their
jalopies
back
in
the
fifties
when
the
sound
in
the
rear
speaker
would
come
just
a
split
second
aafter
the
sound
in
the
front
s
speaker
he
got
up
and
walked
restlessly
around
the
room
he
looked
tired
and
she
thought
with
some
unease
of
how
hard
he
had
worked
over
the
last
thirteen
years
or
so
as
if
it
might
be
possible
to
justify
the
moderateness
of
his
talent
by
working
furiously
almost
nonstop
she
found
herself
having
a
very
uneasy
thought
and
tried
to
push
it
away
but
it
wouldn't
go
suppose
bill
call
had
really
been
from
ralph
foster
inviting
him
down
to
the
plow
and
barrow
for
an
hour
of
armwrestling
or
backgammon
or
maybe
from
freddie
firestone
the
producer
of
attic
room
on
some
problem
or
other
perhaps
even
a
wrongrin
as
the
veddy
british
doctor
wife
down
the
lane
put
it
what
did
such
thoughts
lead
to
why
to
the
idea
that
all
this
derry
mike
hanlon
business
was
nothing
but
a
hallucination
a
hallucination
brought
on
by
an
incipient
nervous
breakdown
but
the
scars
audra
how
do
you
explain
the
scars
he
right
they
weren't
there
and
now
they
are
that
the
truth
and
you
know
it
tell
me
the
rest
she
said
who
killed
your
brother
george
what
did
you
and
these
other
children
do
what
did
you
promise
he
went
to
her
knelt
before
her
like
an
oldfashioned
suitor
about
to
propose
marriage
and
took
her
hands
i
think
i
could
tell
yo
he
said
softly
i
think
that
if
i
really
wanted
to
i
could
most
of
it
i
don't
remember
even
now
but
once
i
started
talking
it
would
come
i
can
sense
those
memories
waiting
to
be
bor
they're
like
clouds
filled
with
rain
only
this
rain
would
be
very
dirty
the
plants
that
grew
after
a
rain
like
that
would
be
monsters
maybe
i
can
face
that
with
the
others
do
they
know
mike
said
he
called
them
all
he
thinks
they'll
all
come
except
maybe
for
stan
he
said
stan
sounded
strange
it
all
sounds
strange
to
me
you're
frightening
me
very
badly
bill
tm
sorry
he
said
and
kissed
her
it
was
like
gettng
a
kiss
from
an
utter
stranger
she
found
herself
hating
this
man
mike
hanlon
i
thought
i
ought
to
explain
as
much
as
i
could
i
thought
that
would
be
better
than
just
creeping
off
into
the
night
i
suppose
some
of
them
may
do
just
that
but
i
have
to
go
and
i
think
stan
will
be
there
no
matter
how
strange
he
sounded
or
maybe
that
just
because
i
can't
imagine
not
going
myself
because
of
your
brother
bill
shook
his
head
slowly
i
could
tell
you
that
but
it
would
be
a
lie
i
loved
him
i
know
how
strange
that
must
sound
after
telling
you
i
haven't
thought
of
him
in
twenty
years
or
so
but
i
loved
the
hell
out
of
that
kid
he
smiled
a
little
he
was
a
spasmoid
but
i
loved
him
you
know
audra
who
had
a
younger
sister
nodded
i
know
but
it
isn't
george
i
can't
explain
what
it
is
i
he
looked
out
the
window
at
the
morning
fog
i
feel
like
a
bird
must
feel
when
fall
comes
and
it
knows
somehow
it
just
knows
it
has
to
fly
home
it
instinct
babe
and
i
guess
i
believe
instinct
the
iron
skeleton
under
all
our
ideas
of
free
will
unless
you're
willing
to
take
the
pipe
or
eat
the
gun
or
take
a
long
walk
off
a
short
dock
you
can't
say
no
to
some
things
you
can't
refuse
to
pick
up
your
option
because
there
is
no
option
you
can't
stop
it
from
happening
any
more
than
you
could
stand
at
home
plate
with
a
bat
in
your
hand
and
let
a
fastball
hit
you
i
have
to
go
that
promise
its
in
my
mind
like
a
fubfishhook
she
stood
up
and
walked
herself
carefully
to
him
she
felt
very
fragile
as
if
she
might
break
she
put
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
turned
him
to
her
take
me
with
you
then
the
expression
of
horror
that
dawned
on
his
face
then
not
horror
of
her
but
for
her
was
so
naked
that
she
stepped
back
really
afraid
for
the
first
time
n
he
said
don't
think
of
that
audra
don't
you
ever
think
of
that
you're
not
going
within
three
thousand
miles
of
derry
i
think
derry
going
to
be
a
very
bad
place
to
be
during
the
next
couple
of
weeks
you're
going
to
stay
here
and
carry
on
and
make
all
the
excuses
for
me
you
have
to
now
promise
me
that
should
i
promise
she
asked
her
eyes
never
leaving
his
should
i
bill
audra
should
i
you
made
a
promise
and
look
what
it
got
you
into
and
me
as
well
since
i'm
your
wife
and
i
love
you
his
big
hands
tightened
painfully
on
her
shoulders
promise
me
promise
ppuhpuh
pruhhuh
and
she
could
not
stand
that
that
broken
word
caught
in
his
mouth
like
a
gaffed
and
wriggling
fish
i
promise
okay
i
promise
she
burst
into
tears
are
you
happy
now
jesus
you're
crazy
the
whole
thing
is
crazy
but
i
promise
he
put
an
arm
around
her
and
led
her
to
the
couch
brought
her
a
brandy
she
sipped
at
it
getting
herself
under
control
a
little
at
a
time
when
do
you
go
then
today
he
said
concorde
i
can
just
make
it
if
i
drive
to
heathrow
instead
of
taking
the
train
freddie
wanted
me
omset
after
ranch
you
go
on
ahead
at
nine
and
you
don't
know
anything
you
see
she
nodded
reluctantly
til
be
in
new
york
before
anything
shows
up
funny
and
in
derry
before
sundown
with
the
right
ccconnections
and
when
do
i
see
you
again
she
asked
softly
he
put
an
arm
around
her
and
held
her
tightly
but
he
never
answered
her
question
derry
the
first
interlude
how
many
human
eyes
had
snatched
glimpses
of
their
secret
anatomies
down
the
passage
of
years
clive
barker
books
of
blood
the
segment
below
and
all
other
interlude
segments
are
drawn
from
derry
an
unauthorized
town
history
by
michael
hanlon
this
is
an
unpublished
set
of
notes
and
accompanying
fragments
of
manuscript
which
read
almost
like
diary
entries
found
in
the
derry
public
library
vault
the
title
given
is
the
one
written
on
the
cover
of
the
looseleaf
binder
in
which
these
notes
were
kept
prior
to
their
appearance
here
the
author
however
refers
to
the
work
several
times
within
his
own
notes
as
derry
a
look
through
hell
back
door
one
supposes
the
thought
of
popular
publication
had
done
more
than
cross
mr
hanlon
mind
january
nd
can
an
entire
city
be
haunted
haunted
as
some
houses
are
supposed
to
be
haunted
not
just
a
single
building
in
that
city
or
the
corner
of
a
single
street
or
a
single
basketball
court
in
a
single
pocketpark
the
netless
basket
jutting
out
at
sunset
like
some
obscure
and
bloody
instrument
of
torture
not
just
one
area
but
everything
the
whole
works
can
that
be
listen
haunted
often
visited
by
ghosts
or
spirits
funk
and
wagnalls
haunting
persistently
recurring
to
the
mind
difficult
to
forget
ditto
funk
and
friend
to
haunt
to
appear
or
recur
often
especially
as
a
ghost
but
and
listen
a
place
often
visited
resort
den
hangout
italics
are
of
course
mine
and
one
more
this
one
like
the
last
is
a
definition
of
haunt
as
a
noun
and
it
the
one
that
really
scares
me
.a
feeding
place
for
animals
like
the
animals
that
beat
up
adrian
mellon
and
then
threw
him
over
the
bridge
like
the
animal
that
was
waiting
underneath
the
bridge
a
feeding
place
for
animals
what
feeding
in
derry
what
feeding
on
derry
you
know
it
sort
of
interesting
i
didn't
know
it
was
possible
for
a
man
to
become
as
frightened
as
i
have
become
since
the
adrian
mellon
business
and
still
live
let
alone
function
it
as
if
i've
fallen
into
a
story
and
everyone
knows
you're
not
supposed
to
feel
this
afraid
until
the
end
of
the
story
when
the
haunter
of
the
dark
finally
comes
out
of
the
woodwork
to
feed
on
you
of
course
on
you
but
if
this
is
a
story
it
not
one
of
those
classic
screamers
by
lovecraft
or
bradbury
or
poe
i
know
you
see
not
everything
but
a
lot
i
ddn't
just
start
when
i
opened
the
derry
news
one
day
last
september
read
the
transcript
of
the
unwin
boy
preliminary
hearing
and
realized
that
the
clown
who
killed
george
denbrough
might
well
be
back
again
i
actually
started
around
i
think
that
is
when
some
part
of
me
which
had
been
asleep
woke
up
knowing
that
its
time
might
be
coming
round
again
what
part
the
watchman
part
i
suppose
or
maybe
it
was
the
voice
of
the
turtle
yes
i
rather
think
it
was
that
i
know
it
what
bill
denbrough
would
believe
i
discovered
news
of
old
horrors
in
old
books
read
intelligence
of
old
atrocities
in
old
periodicals
always
in
the
back
of
my
mind
every
day
a
bit
louder
i
heard
the
seashell
drone
of
some
growing
coalescing
force
i
seemed
to
smell
the
bitter
ozone
aroma
of
lightningsto
come
i
began
making
notes
for
a
book
i
will
almost
certainly
not
live
to
write
and
at
the
same
time
i
went
on
with
my
life
on
one
level
of
my
mind
i
was
and
am
living
with
the
most
grotesque
capering
horrors
on
another
i
have
continued
to
live
the
mundane
life
of
a
small
city
librarian
i
shelve
books
i
make
out
library
cards
for
new
patrons
i
turn
off
the
microfilm
readers
careless
users
sometimes
leave
on
i
joke
with
carole
danner
about
how
much
i
would
like
to
go
to
bed
with
her
and
she
jokes
back
about
how
much
she'd
like
to
go
to
bed
with
me
and
both
of
us
know
that
she
really
joking
and
i'm
really
not
just
as
both
of
us
know
that
she
won't
stay
in
a
little
place
like
derry
for
long
and
i
will
be
here
until
i
die
taping
torn
pages
in
business
week
sitting
down
at
monthly
acquisition
meetings
with
my
pipe
in
one
hand
and
a
stack
of
library
journals
in
the
other
and
waking
in
the
middle
of
the
night
with
my
fists
jammed
against
my
mouth
to
keep
in
the
screams
the
gothic
conventions
are
all
wrong
my
hair
has
not
turned
white
i
do
not
sleepwalk
i
have
not
begun
to
make
cryptic
comments
or
to
carry
a
planchette
around
in
my
sportcoat
pocket
i
think
i
laugh
a
little
more
that
all
and
sometimes
it
must
seem
a
little
shrill
and
strange
because
sometimes
people
look
at
me
oddly
when
i
laugh
part
of
me
the
part
bill
would
call
the
voice
of
the
turtle
says
i
should
call
them
all
tonight
but
am
i
even
now
completely
sure
do
i
want
to
be
completely
sure
no
of
course
not
but
god
what
happened
to
adrian
mellon
is
so
much
like
what
happened
to
stuttering
bill
brother
george
in
the
fail
of
if
it
has
started
again
i
will
call
them
i'll
have
to
but
not
yet
it
too
early
anyway
last
time
it
began
slowly
and
didn't
really
get
going
until
the
summer
of
so
i
wait
and
fill
up
the
waiting
with
words
in
this
notebook
and
long
moments
of
looking
into
the
mirror
to
see
the
stranger
the
boy
became
the
boy
face
was
bookish
and
timid
the
man
face
is
the
face
of
a
bank
teller
in
a
western
movie
the
fellow
who
never
has
any
lines
the
one
who
just
gets
to
put
his
hands
up
and
look
scared
when
the
robbers
come
in
and
if
the
script
calls
anyone
to
get
shot
by
the
bad
guys
he
the
one
same
old
mike
a
little
starey
in
the
eyes
maybe
and
a
little
punchy
from
broken
sleep
but
not
so
you'd
notice
without
a
good
close
look
like
kissingdistance
close
and
i
haven't
been
that
close
to
anyone
in
a
very
long
time
if
you
took
a
casual
glance
at
me
you
might
think
he
been
reading
too
many
books
but
that
all
i
doubt
you'd
guess
how
hard
the
man
with
the
mild
bankteller
face
is
now
struggling
just
to
hold
on
to
hold
on
his
own
mind
if
i
have
to
make
those
calls
it
may
kill
some
of
them
that
one
of
the
things
i've
had
to
face
on
the
long
nights
when
sleep
won't
come
nights
when
i
lie
there
in
bed
wearing
my
conservative
blue
pajamas
my
spectacles
reatly
folded
up
and
lying
on
the
nighttable
next
to
the
glass
of
water
i
always
put
there
in
case
i
wake
up
thirsty
in
the
night
i
lie
there
in
the
dark
and
i
take
small
sips
of
the
water
and
i
wonder
how
much
or
how
little
they
remember
i
am
somehow
convinced
that
they
don't
remember
any
of
it
because
they
don't
need
to
remember
i'm
the
only
one
that
hears
the
voice
of
the
turtle
the
only
one
who
remembers
because
i'm
the
only
one
who
stayed
here
in
derry
and
because
they're
scattered
to
the
four
winds
they
have
no
way
of
knowing
the
identical
patterns
their
lives
have
taken
to
bring
them
back
to
show
them
that
pattern
yes
it
might
kill
some
of
them
it
might
kill
all
of
them
so
i
go
over
it
and
over
it
in
my
mind
i
go
over
them
trying
to
recreate
them
as
they
were
and
as
they
might
now
be
trying
to
decide
which
of
them
is
the
most
vulnerable
richie
trashmout
tozier
i
think
sometimes
he
was
the
one
criss
huggins
and
bowers
seemed
to
catch
up
with
the
most
often
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
ben
was
so
fat
bowers
was
the
one
richie
was
the
most
scared
of
the
one
we
were
all
the
most
scared
of
but
the
others
used
to
really
put
the
fear
of
god
into
him
too
if
i
call
him
out
there
in
california
would
he
see
it
as
some
horrible
return
of
the
big
bullies
two
from
the
grave
and
one
from
the
madhouse
in
juniper
hill
where
he
raves
to
this
day
sometimes
i
think
eddie
was
the
weakest
eddie
with
his
domineering
tank
of
a
mother
and
his
terrible
case
of
asthma
beverly
she
always
tried
to
talk
so
tough
but
she
was
as
scared
as
the
rest
of
us
stuttering
bill
faced
with
a
horror
that
won't
go
away
when
he
puts
the
cover
on
his
typewriter
stan
uris
there
a
guillotine
blade
hanging
over
their
lives
razorsharp
but
the
more
i
think
about
it
the
more
i
think
they
don't
know
that
blade
is
there
i'm
the
one
with
my
hand
on
the
lever
i
can
pull
it
just
by
opening
my
telephone
notebook
and
calling
them
one
after
the
other
maybe
i
won't
have
to
do
it
i
hold
on
to
the
waning
hope
that
i've
mistaken
the
rabbity
cries
of
my
own
timid
mind
for
the
deeper
truer
voice
of
the
turtle
after
all
what
do
i
have
mellon
in
july
a
child
found
dead
on
neibolt
street
last
october
another
found
in
memorial
park
in
early
december
just
before
the
first
snowfall
maybe
it
was
a
tramp
as
the
papers
say
or
a
crazy
who
since
left
derry
or
killed
himself
out
of
remorse
and
self
disgust
as
some
of
the
books
say
the
real
jack
the
ripper
may
have
done
maybe
but
the
albrecht
girl
was
found
directly
across
the
street
from
that
damned
old
house
on
neibolt
street
and
she
was
killed
on
the
same
day
as
george
denbrough
was
twenty
seven
years
before
and
then
the
johnson
boy
found
in
memorial
park
with
one
of
his
legs
missing
below
the
knee
memorial
park
is
of
course
the
home
of
the
derry
standpipe
and
the
boy
was
found
almost
at
its
foot
the
standpipe
is
within
a
shout
of
the
barrens
the
standpipe
is
also
where
stan
uris
saw
those
boys
those
dead
boys
still
it
could
all
be
nothing
but
smoke
and
mirages
could
be
or
coincidence
or
perhaps
something
between
the
two
a
kind
of
malefic
echo
could
that
be
i
sense
that
it
could
be
here
in
derry
anything
could
be
i
think
what
was
here
before
is
still
here
the
thing
that
was
here
in
and
the
thing
that
was
here
in
and
in
when
the
black
spot
was
burned
down
by
the
maine
legion
of
white
decency
the
thing
that
was
here
ha
and
and
early
at
least
until
the
kitchener
ironworks
exploded
the
thing
that
was
here
in
and
the
thing
that
has
shown
up
every
twentyseven
years
or
so
sometimes
it
comes
a
little
sooner
sometimes
a
little
later
but
it
always
comes
as
one
goes
back
the
wrong
notes
are
harder
and
harder
to
find
because
the
records
grow
poorer
and
the
mothholes
in
the
narrative
history
of
the
area
grow
bigger
but
knowing
where
to
look
and
when
to
look
goes
a
long
way
toward
solving
the
problem
it
always
comes
back
you
see
it
so
yes
i
think
i'll
have
to
make
those
calls
i
think
it
was
meant
to
be
us
somehow
for
some
reason
we're
the
ones
who
have
been
elected
to
stop
it
forever
blind
fate
blind
luck
or
is
it
that
damned
turtle
again
does
it
perhaps
command
as
well
as
speak
i
don't
know
and
i
doubt
if
it
matters
all
those
years
ago
bill
said
the
turtle
can't
help
us
and
if
it
was
true
then
it
must
be
true
now
i
think
of
us
standing
in
the
water
hands
clasped
making
that
promise
to
come
back
if
it
ever
started
again
standing
there
almost
like
druids
in
a
ring
our
hands
bleeding
their
own
promise
palm
to
palm
a
ritual
that
is
perhaps
as
old
as
mankind
itself
an
unknowing
tap
driven
into
the
tree
of
all
power
the
one
that
grows
on
the
borderline
between
the
land
of
all
we
know
and
that
of
all
we
suspect
because
the
similarities
but
i'm
doing
my
own
bill
denbrough
here
stuttering
over
the
same
ground
again
and
again
reciting
a
few
facts
and
a
lot
of
unpleasant
and
rather
gaseous
suppositions
growing
more
and
more
obsessive
with
every
paragraph
no
good
useless
dangerous
even
but
it
is
so
very
hard
to
wait
on
events
this
notebook
is
supposed
to
be
an
effort
to
get
beyond
that
obsession
by
widening
the
focus
of
my
attention
after
all
there
is
more
to
this
story
than
six
boys
and
one
girl
none
of
them
happy
none
of
them
accepted
by
their
peers
who
stumbled
into
a
nightmare
during
one
hot
summer
when
eisenhower
was
still
president
it
is
an
attempt
to
pull
the
camera
back
a
little
if
you
will
to
see
the
whole
city
a
place
where
nearly
thirtyfive
thousand
people
work
and
eat
and
sleep
and
copulate
and
shop
and
drive
around
and
walk
and
go
to
school
and
go
to
jail
and
sometimes
disappear
into
the
dark
to
know
what
a
place
is
i
really
do
believe
one
has
to
know
what
it
was
and
if
i
had
to
name
a
day
when
all
of
this
really
started
again
for
me
it
would
be
the
day
in
the
early
spring
of
when
i
went
to
see
albert
carson
who
died
last
summer
at
ninetyone
he
was
full
of
years
as
well
as
honors
he
was
head
librarian
here
from
to
an
incredible
span
but
he
was
an
incredible
man
and
i
felt
that
if
anyone
would
know
which
history
of
this
area
was
the
best
one
to
start
with
albert
carson
would
i
asked
him
my
question
as
we
sat
on
his
porch
and
he
gave
me
my
answer
speaking
in
a
croak
he
was
already
fighting
the
throat
cancer
which
would
eventually
kill
him
not
one
of
them
is
worth
a
shit
as
you
damn
well
know
then
where
should
i
start
start
what
for
christ
sake
researching
the
history
of
the
area
of
derry
township
oh
well
start
with
the
fricke
and
the
michaud
they're
supposed
to
be
the
best
and
after
i
read
those
read
them
christ
no
throw
em
in
the
wastebasket
that
your
first
step
then
read
buddinger
branson
buddinger
was
a
damned
sloppy
researcher
and
afflicted
with
a
terminal
boner
if
half
of
what
i
heard
when
i
was
a
kid
was
true
but
when
it
came
to
derry
his
heart
was
in
the
right
place
he
got
most
of
the
facts
wrong
but
he
got
them
wrong
with
feeling
hanlon
i
laughed
a
little
and
carson
grinned
with
his
leathery
lips
an
expression
of
good
humor
that
was
actually
a
little
frightening
in
that
instant
he
looked
like
a
vulture
happily
guarding
a
freshly
killed
animal
waiting
for
it
to
reach
exactly
the
right
stage
of
tasty
decomposition
before
beginning
to
dine
when
you
finish
with
buddinger
read
ives
make
notes
on
all
the
people
he
talked
to
sandy
ives
is
still
at
the
universty
of
maine
folklorist
after
you
read
him
go
see
him
buy
him
a
dinner
i'd
take
him
to
the
orinoka
because
dinner
at
the
orinoka
seems
to
never
end
pump
him
fill
up
a
notebook
with
names
and
addresses
talk
to
the
oldtimers
he
talked
to
those
that
are
still
left
there
are
a
few
of
us
ahhahhahhah
and
get
some
more
names
from
them
by
then
you'll
have
all
the
place
to
stand
you'll
need
if
you're
half
as
bright
as
i
think
you
are
if
you
chase
down
enough
people
you'll
find
out
a
few
things
that
aren't
in
the
histories
and
you
may
find
they
disturb
your
sleep
derry
what
about
it
derry
not
right
is
it
right
he
asked
in
that
whispery
croak
what
right
what
does
that
word
mean
is
right
pretty
pictures
of
the
kenduskeag
at
sunset
kodachrome
by
soandso
fstop
such
andsuch
if
so
then
derry
is
right
because
there
are
pretty
pictures
of
it
by
the
score
is
right
a
damned
committee
of
dryboxed
old
virgins
to
save
the
governor
mansion
or
to
put
a
commemorative
plaque
in
front
of
the
standpipe
if
that
right
then
derry
right
as
rain
because
we've
got
more
than
our
share
of
old
kittycats
minding
everybody
business
is
right
that
ugly
plastic
statue
of
paul
bunyan
in
front
of
city
center
oh
if
i
had
a
truckful
of
napalm
and
my
old
zippo
lighter
i'd
take
care
of
that
fucking
thing
i
assure
you
but
if
one
aesthetic
is
broad
enough
to
include
plastic
statues
then
derry
is
right
the
question
is
what
does
right
mean
to
you
hanlon
eh
more
to
the
point
what
does
right
not
mean
i
could
only
shake
my
head
he
either
knew
or
he
didn't
he
would
either
tell
or
he
wouldn't
do
you
mean
the
unpleasant
stories
you
may
hear
or
the
ones
you
already
know
there
are
always
unpleasant
stories
a
town
history
is
like
a
rambling
old
mansion
filled
with
rooms
and
cubbyholes
and
laundrychutes
and
garrets
and
all
sorts
of
eccentric
little
hiding
places
not
to
mention
an
occasional
secret
passage
or
two
if
you
go
exploring
mansion
derry
you'll
find
all
sorts
of
things
yes
you
may
be
sorry
later
but
you'll
find
them
and
once
a
thing
is
found
it
can't
be
unfound
can
it
some
of
the
rooms
are
locked
but
there
are
keys
there
are
keys
his
eyes
glinted
at
me
with
an
old
man
shrewdness
you
may
come
to
think
you've
stumbled
on
the
worst
of
derry
secrets
but
there
is
always
one
more
and
one
more
and
one
more
do
you
i
think
i
shall
have
to
ask
you
to
excuse
me
just
now
my
throat
is
very
bad
today
it
time
for
my
medicine
and
my
nap
in
other
words
here
is
a
knife
and
a
fork
my
friend
go
see
what
you
can
cut
with
them
i
started
with
the
fricke
history
and
the
michaud
history
i
followed
carson
advice
and
threw
them
in
the
wastebasket
but
i
read
them
first
they
were
as
bad
as
he
had
suggested
i
read
the
buddinger
history
copied
out
the
footnotes
and
chased
them
down
that
was
more
satisfactory
but
footnotes
are
peculiar
things
you
know
like
footpaths
twisting
through
a
wild
and
anarchic
country
they
split
then
they
split
again
at
any
point
you
may
take
a
wrong
turn
which
leads
you
either
to
a
bramblechoked
dead
end
or
into
swampy
quickmud
if
you
find
a
footnote
a
libraryscience
prof
once
told
a
class
of
which
i
was
a
part
step
on
its
head
and
kill
it
before
it
can
breed
they
do
breed
and
sometimes
the
breeding
is
a
good
thing
but
i
think
that
more
often
it
is
not
those
in
buddinger
stiffly
written
a
history
of
old
derry
orono
university
of
maine
press

wander
through
one
hundred
year
worth
of
forgotten
books
and
dusty
master
dissertations
in
the
fields
of
history
and
folklore
through
articles
in
defunct
magazines
and
amid
brainnumbing
stacks
of
town
reports
and
ledgers
my
conversations
with
sandy
ives
were
more
interesting
his
sources
crossed
buddinger
from
time
to
time
but
a
crossing
was
all
it
ever
was
ives
had
spent
a
good
part
of
his
lifetime
setting
down
oral
histories
yarns
in
other
words
almost
verbatim
a
practice
branson
buddinger
would
undoubtedly
have
seen
as
taking
the
low
road
ives
had
written
a
cycle
of
articles
on
derry
during
the
years
most
of
the
old
timers
he
talked
to
then
were
dead
by
the
time
i
started
my
own
investigations
but
they
had
sons
daughters
nephews
cousins
and
of
course
one
of
the
great
true
facts
of
the
world
is
this
for
every
oldtimer
who
dies
there
a
new
oldtimer
coming
along
and
a
good
story
never
dies
it
is
always
passed
down
i
sat
on
a
lot
of
porches
ad
back
stoops
drank
a
lot
of
tea
black
label
beer
homemade
beer
homemade
rootbeer
tapwater
springwater
i
did
a
lot
of
listening
and
the
wheels
of
my
tape
player
turned
both
buddinger
and
ives
agreed
completely
on
one
point
the
original
party
of
white
settlers
numbered
about
three
hundred
they
were
english
they
had
a
charter
and
were
formally
known
as
the
derrie
company
the
land
granted
them
covered
what
is
today
derry
most
of
newport
and
little
slices
of
the
surrounding
towns
and
in
the
year
everyone
in
derry
township
just
disappeared
they
were
there
in
june
of
that
year
a
community
which
at
that
time
numbered
about
three
hundred
and
forty
souls
but
come
october
they
were
gone
the
little
village
of
wooden
homes
stood
utterly
deserted
one
of
them
which
once
stood
roughly
at
the
place
where
witcham
and
jackson
streets
intersect
today
was
burned
to
the
ground
the
michaud
history
states
firmly
that
all
of
the
villagers
were
slaughtered
by
indians
but
there
is
no
basis
save
the
one
burned
house
for
that
idea
more
likely
someone
stove
just
got
too
hot
and
the
house
went
up
in
flames
indian
massacre
doubtful
no
bones
no
bodies
flood
not
that
year
disease
no
word
of
it
in
the
surrounding
towns
they
just
disappeared
all
of
them
all
three
hundred
and
forty
of
them
without
a
trace
so
far
as
i
know
the
only
case
remotely
like
it
in
american
history
is
the
disappearance
of
the
colonists
on
roanoke
island
virginia
every
schookchild
in
the
country
knows
about
that
one
but
who
knows
about
the
derry
disappearance
not
even
the
people
who
live
here
apparently
i
quizzed
several
juniorhigh
students
who
are
taking
the
required
mainehistory
course
and
none
of
them
knew
a
thing
about
it
then
i
checked
the
text
maine
then
and
now
there
are
better
than
forty
index
entries
for
derry
most
of
them
concerning
the
boom
years
of
the
lumber
industry
nothing
about
the
disappearance
of
the
original
colonists
and
yet
that
what
shall
i
call
it
that
quiet
fits
the
pattern
too
there
is
a
kind
of
curtain
of
quiet
which
cloaks
much
of
what
has
happened
here
and
yet
people
do
talk
i
guess
nothing
can
stop
people
from
talking
but
you
have
to
listen
hard
and
that
is
a
rare
skill
i
flatter
myself
that
i've
developed
it
over
the
last
four
years
if
i
haven't
then
my
aptitude
for
the
job
must
be
poor
indeed
because
i've
had
enough
practice
an
old
man
told
me
about
how
his
wife
had
heard
voices
speaking
to
her
from
the
drain
of
her
kitchen
sink
in
the
three
weeks
before
their
daughter
died
that
was
in
the
early
winter
of
the
girl
he
spoke
of
was
one
of
the
early
victims
in
the
murderspree
which
began
with
george
denbrough
and
did
not
end
until
the
following
summer
a
whole
slew
of
voices
all
of
em
babblin
together
he
told
me
he
owned
a
gulf
station
on
kansas
street
and
talked
in
between
slow
limping
trips
out
to
the
pumps
where
he
filled
gastanks
checked
oillevels
and
wiped
windshields
said
she
spoke
back
once
even
though
she
was
ascairt
leaned
right
over
the
dram
she
did
and
hollered
down
into
it
who
the
hell
are
you
she
calls
what
your
name
and
all
these
voices
answered
back
she
said
grunts
and
babbles
and
howls
and
yips
screams
and
laughin
don't
you
know
and
she
said
they
were
sayin
what
the
possessed
man
said
to
jesus
our
name
is
legion”
they
said
she
wouldn't
go
near
that
sink
for
two
years
for
them
two
years
i'd
spend
twelve
hours
a
day
down
here
bustin
my
hump
then
have
to
go
home
and
warsh
all
the
damn
dishes
he
was
drinking
a
can
of
pepsi
from
the
machine
outside
the
office
door
a
man
of
seventytwo
or
three
in
faded
gray
work
fatigues
rivers
of
wrinkles
flowing
down
from
the
comers
of
his
eyes
and
mouth
by
now
you
prob'ly
think
i'm
as
crazy
as
a
bedbug
he
said
but
i'll
tell
you
sumpin
else
if
you'll
turn
off
y
whirligig
there
i
turned
off
my
taperecorder
and
smiled
at
him
considering
some
of
the
things
i've
heard
over
the
last
couple
of
years
you'd
have
b
go
a
fair
country
distance
to
convince
me
you're
crazy
i
said
he
smiled
back
but
there
was
no
humor
in
it
was
doin
the
dishes
one
night
same
as
usual
this
was
in
the
fall
of
after
things
had
settled
down
again
my
wife
was
upstair
sleepin
betty
was
the
only
kid
god
ever
saw
fit
to
give
us
and
after
she
was
killed
my
wife
spent
a
lot
of
her
time
sleepin
anyway
i
pulled
the
plug
and
the
water
started
runnin
out
of
the
sink
you
know
the
sound
real
soapy
water
makes
when
it
goes
down
the
drain
kind
of
a
suckin
sound
it
is
it
was
makin
that
noise
but
i
wasn't
thinkin
about
it
only
about
goin
out
and
choppin
some
kindlin
in
the
shed
and
just
as
that
sound
started
to
die
off
i
heard
my
daughter
down
in
there
i
heard
betty
somewhere
down
in
those
friggin
pipes
laughin
she
was
somewheres
down
there
in
the
dark
laughin
only
it
sounded
more
like
she
was
screamin
once
you
listened
a
bit
or
both
screamin
and
laughin
down
there
in
the
pipes
that
the
only
time
i
ever
heard
anything
like
that
maybe
i
just
imagined
it
but
i
don't
think
so
he
looked
at
me
and
i
looked
at
him
the
light
falling
through
the
dirty
plateglass
windows
onto
his
face
filled
him
up
with
years
made
him
look
as
ancient
as
methuselah
i
remember
how
cold
i
felt
at
that
moment
how
cold
you
think
i'm
storying
you
along
the
old
man
asked
me
the
old
man
who
would
have
been
just
about
fortyfive
in
the
old
man
to
whom
god
had
given
a
single
daughter
betty
ripsom
by
name
betty
had
been
found
on
outer
jackson
street
just
after
christmas
of
that
year
frozen
her
remains
ripped
wide
open
n
i
said
i
don't
think
you're
just
storying
me
along
mr
ripsom
and
you're
tellin
the
truth
to
he
said
with
a
land
of
wonder
i
can
see
it
on
y'face
i
think
he
meant
to
tell
me
something
more
then
but
the
bell
behind
us
dinged
sharply
as
a
car
rolled
over
the
hose
on
the
tarmac
and
pulled
up
to
the
pumps
when
the
bell
rang
both
of
us
jumped
and
i
uttered
a
thin
little
cry
ripsom
got
to
his
feet
and
limped
out
to
the
car
wiping
his
hands
on
a
ball
of
waste
when
he
came
back
in
he
looked
at
me
as
though
i
were
a
rather
unsavory
stranger
who
had
just
happened
to
wander
in
off
the
street
i
made
my
goodbyes
and
left
buddinger
and
ives
agree
on
some
tiling
else
things
really
are
not
right
here
in
derry
things
in
derry
have
never
been
right
i
saw
albert
carson
for
the
last
time
a
scant
month
before
he
died
his
throat
had
gotten
much
worse
all
he
could
manage
was
a
hissing
little
whisper
still
thinking
about
writing
a
history
of
derry
hanlon
still
toying
with
the
idea
i
said
but
i
had
of
course
never
planned
to
write
a
history
of
the
township
not
exactly
and
i
think
he
knew
it
it
would
take
pu
twenty
years
he
whispered
and
no
one
would
read
it
no
one
would
want
to
read
it
let
it
go
hanlon
he
paused
a
moment
and
then
added
buddinger
committed
suicide
you
know
of
course
i
had
known
that
but
only
because
people
always
talk
and
i
had
learned
to
listen
the
article
in
the
news
had
called
it
a
falling
accident
and
it
was
true
that
branson
buddinger
had
taken
a
fall
what
the
news
neglected
to
mention
was
that
he
fell
from
a
stool
in
his
closet
and
he
had
a
noose
around
his
neck
at
the
time
you
know
about
the
cycle
i
looked
at
him
startled
oh
yes
carson
whispered
i
know
every
twentysix
or
twentyseven
years
buddinger
knew
too
a
lot
of
the
oldtimers
do
although
that
is
one
thing
they
won't
talk
about
even
if
you
load
them
up
with
booze
let
it
go
hanlon
he
reached
out
with
one
birdclaw
hand
he
closed
it
around
my
wrist
and
i
could
feel
the
hot
cancer
that
was
loose
and
raving
through
his
body
eating
anything
and
everything
left
that
was
still
good
to
eat
not
that
there
could
have
been
much
by
that
time
albert
carson
cupboards
were
almost
bare
michael
this
is
nothing
you
want
to
mess
into
there
are
things
here
in
derry
that
bite
let
it
go
let
it
go
tcan't
then
beware
he
said
suddenly
the
huge
and
frightened
eyes
of
a
child
were
looking
out
of
his
dying
oldman
face
beware
derry
my
home
town
named
after
the
county
of
the
same
name
in
ireland
derry
i
was
born
here
in
derry
home
hospital
attended
derry
elementary
school
went
to
junior
high
at
ninth
street
middle
school
to
high
school
at
derry
high
i
went
to
the
university
of
maine
ain't
in
derry
but
it
just
down
the
rud
the
oldtimers
say
and
then
i
came
right
back
here
to
the
derry
public
library
i
am
a
smalltown
man
living
a
smalltown
life
one
among
millions
but
but
in
a
crew
of
lumber
jacks
found
the
remains
of
another
crew
that
had
spent
the
winter
snowed
in
at
a
camp
on
the
upper
kenduskeag
at
the
tip
of
what
the
kids
still
call
the
barrens
there
were
nine
of
them
in
all
all
nine
hacked
to
pieces
heads
had
rolled
not
to
mention
arms
a
foot
or
two
and
a
man’s
penis
had
been
nailed
to
one
wall
of
the
cabin
but
in
john
markson
killed
his
entire
family
with
poison
and
then
sitting
in
the
middle
of
the
circle
he
had
made
with
their
corpses
he
gobbled
an
entire
whitenightshade
mushroom
his
death
agonies
must
have
been
intense
the
town
constable
who
found
him
wrote
in
his
report
that
at
first
he
believed
the
corpse
was
grinning
at
him
he
wrote
of
markson
awful
white
smile
the
white
smile
was
an
entire
mouthful
of
the
killer
mushroom
markson
had
gone
on
eating
even
as
the
cramps
and
the
excruciating
muscle
spasms
must
have
been
wracking
his
dying
body
but
on
easter
sunday
the
owners
of
the
kitchener
ironworks
which
stood
where
the
brandspankingnew
derry
mall
now
stands
held
an
easteregg
hunt
for
all
the
good
children
of
derry
the
hunt
took
place
in
the
huge
ironworks
building
dangerous
areas
were
closed
off
and
employees
volunteered
their
time
to
stand
guard
and
make
sure
no
adventurous
boy
or
girl
decided
to
duck
under
the
barriers
and
explore
five
hundred
chocolate
easter
eggs
wrapped
in
gay
ribbons
were
hidden
about
the
rest
of
the
works
according
to
buddinger
there
was
at
least
one
child
present
for
each
of
those
eggs
they
ran
giggling
and
whooping
and
yelling
through
the
sundaysilent
ironworks
finding
the
eggs
under
the
giant
tippervats
inside
the
desk
drawers
of
the
foreman
balanced
between
the
great
rusty
teeth
of
gearwheels
inside
the
molds
on
the
third
floor
in
the
old
photographs
these
molds
look
like
cupcake
tins
from
some
giant
kitchen
three
generations
of
kitcheners
were
there
to
watch
the
gay
riot
and
to
award
prizes
at
the
end
of
the
hunt
which
was
to
come
at
four
o'clock
whether
all
the
eggs
had
been
found
or
not
the
end
actually
came
fortyfive
minutes
early
at
quarter
past
three
that
was
when
the
ironworks
exploded
seventytwo
people
were
pulled
dead
from
the
wreckage
before
the
sun
went
down
the
final
toll
was
a
hundred
and
two
eightyeight
of
the
dead
were
children
on
the
following
wednesday
while
the
city
still
lay
in
stunned
silent
@ntemplation
of
the
tragedy
a
woman
found
the
head
of
nineyearold
robert
dohay
caught
in
the
limbs
of
her
backyard
apple
tree
there
was
chocolate
on
the
dohay
lad
teeth
and
blood
in
his
hair
he
was
the
last
of
the
known
dead
eight
children
and
one
adult
were
never
accounted
for
it
was
the
worst
tragedy
in
derry
history
even
worse
than
the
fire
at
the
black
spot
in
and
it
was
never
explained
all
four
of
the
ironworks
boilers
were
shut
down
not
just
banked
shut
down
but
the
murder
rate
in
derry
is
six
times
the
murder
rate
of
any
other
town
of
comparable
size
in
new
england
i
found
my
tentative
conclusions
in
this
matter
so
difficult
to
believe
that
i
turned
my
figures
over
to
one
of
the
highschool
hackers
who
spends
what
time
he
doesn't
spend
in
front
of
his
commodore
here
in
the
library
he
went
several
steps
further
scratch
a
hacker
find
an
overachiever
by
adding
another
dozen
small
cities
to
what
he
called
the
stat
poo
and
presenting
me
with
a
computer
generated
lar
graph
where
derry
slicks
out
like
a
sore
thumb
people
must
have
wicked
short
tempers
here
mr
hanlon
was
his
only
comment
i
didn't
reply
if
i
had
i
might
have
told
him
that
something
in
derry
has
a
wicked
short
temper
anyway
here
in
derry
children
disappear
unexplained
and
unfound
at
the
rate
of
forty
to
sixty
a
year
most
are
teenagers
they
are
assumed
to
be
runaways
i
suppose
some
of
them
even
are
and
during
what
albert
carson
would
undoubtedly
have
called
the
time
of
the
cycle
the
rate
of
disappearance
shoots
nearly
out
of
sight
in
the
year
for
instance
the
year
the
black
spot
burned
there
were
better
than
one
hundred
and
seventy
child
disappearances
in
derry
and
you
must
remember
that
these
are
only
the
disappearances
which
were
reported
to
the
police
and
thus
documented
nothing
surprising
about
it
the
current
chief
of
police
told
me
when
i
showed
him
the
statistic
jt
was
the
depression
most
of
em
probably
got
tired
of
eating
potato
soup
or
going
flat
hungry
at
home
and
went
off
riding
the
rods
looking
for
something
better
during
a
hundred
and
twentyseven
children
ranging
in
age
from
three
to
nineteen
were
reported
missing
in
derry
was
there
a
depression
in
i
asked
chief
rademacher
no
he
said
but
people
move
around
a
lot
hanlon
kids
in
particular
get
itchy
feet
have
a
fight
with
the
folks
about
coming
in
late
after
a
date
and
boom
they're
gone
i
showed
chief
rademacher
the
picture
of
chad
lowe
which
had
appeared
in
the
derry
news
in
april
you
think
this
one
ran
away
after
a
fight
with
his
folks
about
coming
in
late
chief
rademacher
he
was
three
and
a
half
when
he
dropped
out
of
sight
rademacher
fixed
me
with
a
sour
glance
and
told
me
it
sure
had
been
nice
talking
with
me
but
if
there
was
nothing
else
he
was
busy
i
left
haunted
haunting
haunt
often
visited
by
ghosts
or
spirits
as
in
the
pipes
under
the
sink
to
appear
or
recur
often
as
every
twentyfive
twentysix
or
twentyseven
years
a
feeding
place
for
animals
as
in
the
cases
of
george
denbrough
adrian
mellon
betty
ripsom
the
albrecht
girl
the
johnson
boy
a
feeding
place
for
animals
yes
that
the
one
that
haunts
me
if
anything
else
happens
anything
at
all
i'll
make
the
calls
i'll
have
to
in
the
meantime
i
have
my
suppositions
my
broken
rest
and
my
memories
my
damned
memories
oh
and
one
other
thing
i
have
this
notebook
don't
i
the
wall
i
wail
to
and
here
i
sit
my
hand
shaking
so
badly
i
can
hardly
write
in
it
here
i
st
in
the
deserted
library
after
closing
listening
to
faint
sounds
in
the
dark
stacks
watching
the
shadows
thrown
by
the
dim
yellow
globes
to
make
sure
they
don't
move
don't
change
here
i
sit
next
to
the
telephone
i
put
my
free
hand
on
it
let
it
slide
down
touch
the
holes
in
the
dial
that
could
put
me
in
touch
with
all
of
them
my
old
pals
we
went
deep
together
we
went
into
the
black
together
would
we
come
out
of
the
black
if
we
went
in
a
second
time
i
don't
think
so
please
god
i
don't
have
to
call
them
please
god

takes
a
fall
around
pm
one
of
the
stews
serving
first
class
on
the
omahatochicago
run
united
airlines
flight
gets
one
hell
of
a
shock
she
thinks
for
a
few
moments
that
the
man
in
la
has
died
when
he
boarded
at
omaha
she
thought
to
herself
oh
boy
here
comes
trouble
he
just
as
drunk
as
a
lord
the
stink
of
whiskey
around
his
head
reminded
her
fleetingly
of
the
cloud
of
dust
that
always
surrounds
the
dirty
little
boy
in
the
peanuts
strip
pig
pen
his
name
is
she
was
nervous
about
first
service
which
is
the
booze
service
she
was
sure
he
would
ask
for
a
drink
and
probably
a
double
then
she
would
have
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
serve
him
also
just
to
add
to
the
fun
there
have
been
thunderstorms
all
along
the
route
tonight
and
she
is
quite
sure
that
at
some
point
the
man
a
lanky
guy
dressed
in
jeans
and
chambray
would
begin
upchucking
but
when
first
service
came
along
the
tall
man
ordered
nothing
more
than
a
glass
of
club
soda
just
as
polite
as
you
could
want
his
service
light
has
not
gone
on
and
the
stew
forgets
all
about
him
soon
enough
because
the
flight
is
a
busy
one
the
flight
is
in
fact
the
kind
you
want
to
forget
as
soon
as
it
over
one
of
those
during
which
you
just
might
if
you
had
time
have
a
few
questions
about
the
possibility
of
your
own
survival
united
slaloms
between
the
ugly
pockets
of
thunder
and
lightning
like
a
good
skier
going
downhill
the
air
is
very
rough
the
passengers
exclaim
and
make
uneasy
jokes
about
the
lightning
they
can
see
flickering
on
and
off
in
the
thick
pillars
of
cloud
around
the
plane
mommy
is
god
taking
pictures
of
the

little
boy
asks
and

looking

green

shakily
first
service
turns
out
to
be
the
only
service
on
that
night
the
seatbelt
sign
goes
on
twenty
minutes
into
the
flight
and
stays
on
all
the
same
the
stewardesses
stay
in
the
aisles
answering
the
callbuttons
which
go
off
like
strings
of
polite
society
firecrackers
ralph
is
busy
tonight
the
head
stew
says
to
her
as
they
pass
in
the
aisle
the
head
stew
is
going
back
to
tourist
with
a
fresh
supply
of
airsick
bags
it
is
halfcode
halfjoke
ralph
is
always
busy
on
bumpy
flights
the
plane
lurches
someone
cries
out
softly
the
stewardess
turns
a
bit
and
puts
out
a
hand
to
catch
her
balance
and
looks
directly
into
the
staring
sightless
eyes
of
the
man
in
ia
oh
my
dear
god
he
dead
she
thinks
the
liquor
before
he
got
on
then
the
bumps
his
heart
scared
to
death
the
lanky
man
eyes
are
on
hers
but
they
are
not
seeing
her
they
do
not
move
they
are
perfectly
glazed
surely
they
are
the
eyes
of
a
dead
man
the
stew
turns
away
from
that
awful
gaze
her
own
heart
pumping
away
in
her
throat
at
a
runaway
rate
wondering
what
to
do
how
to
proceed
and
thanking
god
that
at
least
the
man
has
no
seatmate
to
perhaps
scream
and
start
a
panic
she
decides
she
will
have
to
notify
first
the
head
stew
and
then
the
male
crew
up
front
perhaps
they
can
wrap
a
blanket
around
him
and
close
his
eyes
the
pilot
will
keep
the
belt
light
on
even
if
the
air
smooths
out
so
no
one
can
come
forward
to
use
the
john
and
when
the
other
passengers
deplane
they'll
think
he
just
asleep
these
thoughts
go
through
her
mind
rapidly
and
she
turns
back
for
a
confirming
look
the
dead
sightless
eyes
fix
upon
hers
and
then
the
corpse
picks
up
his
glass
of
club
soda
and
sips
from
it
just
then
the
plane
staggers
again
tilts
and
the
stew
little
scream
of
surprise
is
lost
in
other
heartier
cries
of
fear
the
man
eyes
move
then
not
much
but
enough
so
she
understands
that
he
is
alive
and
seeing
her
and
she
thinks
why
i
thought
when
he
got
on
that
he
was
in
his
midfifties
but
he
nowhere
near
that
old
in
spite
of
the
graying
hair
she
goes
to
him
although
she
can
hear
the
impatient
chime
of
callbuttons
behind
her
ralph
is
indeed
busy
tonight
after
their
perfectly
safe
landing
at
o'hare
thirty
minutes
from
now
the
stews
will
dispose
of
over
seventy
airsick
bags
everything
okay
si
she
asks
smiling
the
smile
feels
false
unreal
everything
is
fine
and
well
the
lanky
man
says
she
glances
at
the
firstclass
stub
tacked
into
the
little
slot
on
his
seatback
and
sees
that
his
name
is
hanscom
fine
and
well
but
it
a
bit
bumpy
tonight
isn't
it
you've
got
your
work
cut
out
for
you
i
think
don't
bother
with
me
i'm
he
offers
her
a
ghastly
smile
a
smile
that
makes
her
think
of
scarecrows
flapping
in
dead
november
fields
i'm
fine
and
well
you
looke
dead
a
little
under
the
weather
was
thinking
of
the
old
day
he
says
i
only
realized
earlier
tonight
that
there
were
such
things
as
old
days
at
least
as
far
as
i
myself
am
concerned
more
callbuttons
chime
pardon
me
stewardess
'
someone
calls
nervously
well
if
you're
quite
sure
you're
all
right
was
thinking
about
a
dam
i
built
with
some
friends
of
min
ben
hanscom
says
the
first
friends
i
ever
had
i
guess
they
were
building
the
dam
when
i
he
stops
looks
startled
then
laughs
it
is
an
honest
laugh
almost
the
carefree
laugh
of
a
boy
and
it
sounds
very
odd
in
this
jouncing
bucking
plane
when
i
dropped
in
on
them
and
that
almost
literally
what
i
did
anyhow
they
were
making
a
helluva
mess
with
that
dam
i
remember
that
stewardess
excuse
me
sir
i
ought
to
get
about
my
appointed
rounds
again
of
course
you
should
she
hurries
away
glad
to
be
rid
of
that
gaze
that
deadly
almost
hypnotic
gaze
ben
hanscom
turns
his
head
to
the
window
and
looks
out
lightning
goes
off
inside
huge
thunderheads
nine
miles
off
the
starboard
wing
in
the
stutterflashes
of
light
the
clouds
look
like
huge
transparent
brains
filled
with
bad
thoughts
he
feels
in
the
pocket
of
his
vest
but
the
silver
dollars
are
gone
out
of
his
pocket
and
into
ricky
lee
suddenly
he
wishes
he
had
saved
at
least
one
of
them
it
might
have
come
in
handy
of
course
you
could
go
down
to
any
bank
at
least
when
you
weren't
bumping
around
at
twentyseven
thousand
feet
you
could
and
get
a
handful
of
silver
dollars
but
you
couldn't
do
anything
with
the
lousy
copper
sandwiches
the
government
was
trying
to
pass
off
as
real
coins
these
days
and
for
werewolves
and
vampires
and
all
manner
of
things
that
squirm
by
starlight
it
was
silver
you
wanted
honest
silver
you
needed
silver
to
stop
a
monster
you
needed
he
closed
his
eyes
the
air
around
him
was
full
of
chimes
the
plane
rocked
and
rolled
and
bumped
and
the
air
was
full
of
chimes
chimes
no
bells
it
was
bells
it
was
the
bell
the
bell
of
all
bells
the
one
you
waited
for
all
year
once
the
new
wore
off
school
again
and
that
always
happened
by
the
end
of
the
first
week
the
bell
the
one
that
signalled
freedom
again
the
apotheosis
of
all
school
bells
ben
hanscom
sits
in
his
firstclass
seat
suspended
amid
the
thunders
at
twentyseven
thousand
feet
his
face
turned
to
the
window
and
he
feels
the
wall
of
time
grow
suddenly
thin
some
terrible/wonderful
peristalsis
has
begun
to
take
place
he
thinks
my
god
i
am
being
digested
by
my
own
past
the
lightning
plays
fitfully
across
his
face
and
although
he
does
not
know
it
the
day
has
just
turned
may
th
has
become
may
th
over
the
dark
and
stormy
country
that
is
western
illinois
tonight
farmers
backsore
with
plantings
sleep
like
the
dead
below
and
dream
their
quicksilver
dreams
and
who
hows
what
may
move
in
their
barns
and
their
cellars
and
their
fields
as
the
lightning
walks
and
the
thunder
talks
no
one
knows
these
things
they
know
only
that
power
is
loose
in
the
night
and
the
air
is
crazy
with
the
big
volts
of
the
storm
but
its
bells
at
twentyseven
thousand
feet
as
the
plane
breaks
into
the
clear
again
as
its
motion
steadies
again
it
is
bells
it
is
the
bell
as
ben
hanscom
sleeps
and
as
he
sleeps
the
wall
between
past
and
present
disappears
completely
and
he
tumbles
backward
through
years
like
a
man
falling
down
a
deep
wellwells
time
traveller
perhaps
falling
with
a
broken
iron
rung
in
one
hand
down
and
down
into
the
land
of
the
morlocks
where
machines
pound
on
and
on
in
the
tunnels
of
the
night
it
and
suddenly
he
is
here
here
in
june
of
bright
summerlight
is
everywhere
and
behind
sleeping
eyelids
ben
hanscom
pupils
contract
at
the
command
of
his
dreaming
brain
which
sees
not
the
darkness
which
lies
over
western
illinois
but
the
bright
sunlight
of
a
june
day
in
derry
maine
twentyseven
yean

bells
the
bell
school
school
is
school
is
out
the
sound
of
the
bell
went
burring
up
and
down
the
halls
of
derry
school
a
big
brick
building
which
stood
on
jackson
street
and
at
its
sound
the
children
in
ben
hanscom
fifth
grade
classroom
raised
a
spontaneous
cheer
and
mrs
douglas
usually
the
strictest
of
teachers
made
no
effort
to
quell
them
perhaps
she
knew
it
would
have
been
impossible
children
she
called
when
the
cheer
died
may
i
have
your
attention
for
a
final
moment
now
a
babble
of
excited
chatter
mixed
with
a
few
groans
rose
in
the
classroom
mrs
douglas
was
holding
their
report
cards
in
her
hand
sure
hope
i
pass
sally
mueller
said
chirpily
to
bev
marsh
who
sat
in
the
next
row
sally
was
bright
pretty
vivacious
bev
was
also
pretty
but
there
was
nothing
vivacious
about
her
this
afternoon
last
day
of
school
or
not
she
sat
looking
moodily
down
at
her
penny
loafers
there
was
a
fading
yellow
bruise
on
one
of
her
cheeks
don't
give
a
shit
if
i
do
or
not
bev
said
sally
sniffed
ladies
don't
use
such
language
the
sniff
said
then
she
turned
to
greta
bowie
it
had
probably
only
been
the
excitement
of
the
bell
signalling
the
end
of
another
school
year
that
had
caused
sally
to
slip
and
speak
to
beverly
anyhow
ben
thought
sally
mueller
and
greta
bowie
both
came
from
rich
families
with
houses
on
west
broadway
while
bev
came
to
school
from
one
of
those
shimmy
apartment
buildings
on
lower
main
street
lower
main
street
and
west
broadway
were
only
a
mile
and
a
half
apart
but
even
a
kid
like
ben
knew
that
the
real
distance
was
like
the
distance
between
earth
and
the
planet
pluto
all
you
had
to
do
was
look
at
beverly
marsh
cheap
sweater
her
toobig
skirt
that
probably
came
from
the
salvation
army
thriftbox
and
her
scuffed
pennyloafers
to
know
just
how
far
one
was
from
the
other
but
ben
still
liked
beverly
better
a
lot
better
sally
and
greta
had
nice
clothes
and
he
guessed
they
probably
had
their
hair
permed
or
waved
or
something
every
month
or
so
but
he
didn't
think
that
changed
the
basic
facts
at
all
they
could
get
their
hair
permed
every
day
and
they'd
still
be
a
couple
of
conceited
snots
he
thought
beverly
was
nicer
and
much
prettier
although
he
never
in
a
million
years
would
have
dared
say
such
a
thing
to
her
but
still
sometimes
in
the
heart
of
winter
when
the
light
outside
seemed
yellowsleepy
like
a
cat
curled
up
on
a
sofa
when
mrs
douglas
was
droning
on
about
mathematics
how
to
carry
down
in
long
division
or
how
to
find
the
common
denominator
of
two
fractions
so
you
could
add
them
or
reading
the
questions
from
shining
bridges
or
talking
about
tin
deposits
in
paraguay
on
those
days
when
it
seemed
that
school
would
never
end
and
it
didn't
matter
if
it
didn't
because
all
the
world
outside
was
slush
on
those
days
ben
would
sometimes
look
sideways
at
beverly
stealing
her
face
and
his
heart
would
both
hurt
desperately
and
somehow
gow
brighter
at
the
same
time
he
supposed
he
had
a
crush
on
her
or
was
in
love
with
her
and
that
was
why
it
was
always
beverly
he
thought
of
when
the
penguins
came
on
the
radio
singing
earth
angel
my
darling
dear
/
love
you
all
the
time
yeah
it
was
stupid
all
right
sloppy
as
a
used
kleenex
but
it
was
all
right
too
because
he
would
never
tell
he
thought
that
fat
boys
were
probably
only
allowed
to
love
pretty
girls
inside
if
he
told
anyone
how
he
felt
not
that
he
had
anyone
to
tell
that
person
would
probably
laugh
until
he
had
a
heartattack
and
if
he
ever
told
beverly
she
would
either
laugh
herself
bad
or
make
retching
noises
of
disgust
worse
now
please
come
up
as
soon
as
i
call
your
name
paul
andersen
carla
bordeaux
greta
bowie
calvin
clark
cissy
clark

as
she
called
their
names
mrs
douglas
fifthgrade
class
came
forward
one
by
one
except
for
the
clark
twins
who
came
together
as
always
hand
in
hand
indistinguishable
except
for
the
length
of
their
whiteblonde
hair
and
the
fact
that
she
wore
a
dress
while
he
wore
jeans
took
their
buffcolored
report
cards
with
the
american
flag
and
the
pledge
of
allegiance
on
the
front
and
the
lord
prayer
on
the
back
walked
sedately
out
of
the
classroom
and
then
pounded
down
the
hall
to
where
the
big
front
doors
had
been
chocked
open
and
then
they
simply
ran
out
into
summer
and
were
gone
some
on
bikes
some
skipping
some
riding
invisible
horses
and
slapping
their
hands
against
the
sides
of
their
thighs
to
manufacture
hoofbeats
some
with
arms
slung
about
each
other
singing
mine
eyes
have
seen
the
glory
of
the
burning
of
the
school
to
the
tune
of
the
battle
hymn
of
the
republic
marcia
fadden
frank
frick
ben
hanscom

he
rose
stealing
his
last
glance
at
beverly
marsh
for
the
summer
or
so
he
thought
then
and
went
forward
to
mrs
douglas
desk
an
elevenyearold
kid
with
a
can
roughly
the
size
of
new
mexico
said
can
packed
into
a
pair
of
horrid
new
bluejeans
that
shone
little
darts
of
light
from
the
copper
rivets
and
went
whsshtwhsshtwhssht
as
his
big
thighs
brushed
together
his
hips
swung
girlishly
his
stomach
slid
from
side
to
side
he
was
wearing
a
baggy
sweatshirt
although
the
day
was
warm
he
almost
always
wore
baggy
sweatshirts
because
he
was
deeply
ashamed
of
his
chest
and
had
been
since
the
first
day
of
school
after
the
christmas
vacation
when
he
had
worn
one
of
the
new
ivy
league
shuts
his
mother
had
given
him
and
belch
huggins
who
was
a
sixthgrader
had
cawed
hey
you
guys
lookit
what
santy
claus
brought
ben
hanscom
for
christmas
a
big
set
of
titties
belch
had
nearly
collapsed
with
the
deliciousness
of
his
wit
others
had
laughed
as
well
a
few
of
them
girls
if
a
hole
leading
into
the
underworld
had
opened
before
him
at
that
very
moment
ben
would
have
dropped
into
it
without
a
sound
or
perhaps
with
the
faintest
murmur
of
gratitude
since
that
day
he
wore
sweatshirts
he
had
four
of
them
the
baggy
brown
the
baggy
green
and
two
baggy
blues
it
was
one
of
the
few
things
on
which
he
had
managed
to
stand
up
to
his
mother
one
of
the
few
lines
he
had
ever
in
the
course
of
his
mostly
complacent
childhood
felt
compelled
to
draw
in
the
dust
if
he
had
seen
beverly
marsh
giggling
with
the
others
that
day
he
supposed
he
would
have
died
its
been
a
pleasure
having
you
this
year
benjamin
mrs
douglas
said
as
she
handed
him
his
report
card
thank
you
mrs
douglas
a
mocking
falsetto
wavered
from
somewhere
at
the
back
of
the
room
sankooo
missus
dougwiss
it
was
henry
bowers
of
course
henry
was
in
ben
fifthgrade
class
instead
of
in
the
sixth
grade
with
his
friends
belch
huggins
and
victor
criss
because
he
had
been
kept
back
the
year
before
ben
had
an
idea
that
bowers
was
going
to
stay
back
again
his
name
had
not
been
called
when
mrs
douglas
handed
out
the
rankcards
and
that
meant
trouble
ben
was
uneasy
about
this
because
if
henry
did
stay
back
again
ben
himself
would
be
partly
responsible
and
henry
knew
it
during
the
year
final
tests
the
week
before
mrs
douglas
had
reseated
them
at
random
by
drawing
their
names
from
a
hat
on
her
desk
ben
had
ended
up
sitting
next
to
henry
bowers
in
the
last
row
as
always
ben
curled
his
arm
around
his
paper
and
then
bent
close
to
it
feeling
the
somehow
comforting
press
of
his
gut
against
his
desk
licking
his
bebop
pencil
occasionally
for
inspiration
about
halfway
through
tuesday
examination
which
happened
to
be
math
a
whisper
drifted
across
the
aisle
to
ben
it
was
as
low
and
uncarrying
and
expert
as
the
whisper
of
a
veteran
con
passing
a
message
in
the
prison
exercise
yard
let
me
copy
ben
had
looked
to
his
left
and
directly
into
the
black
and
furious
eyes
of
henry
bowers
henry
was
a
big
boy
even
for
twelve
his
arms
and
legs
were
thick
with
farmmuscle
his
father
who
was
reputed
to
be
crazy
had
a
little
spread
out
at
the
end
of
kansas
street
near
the
newport
town
line
and
henry
put
in
at
least
thirty
hours
a
week
hoeing
weeding
planting
digging
rocks
cutting
wood
and
reaping
if
there
was
anything
to
reap
henry
hair
was
cut
in
an
angry
looking
flattop
short
enough
for
the
white
of
his
scalp
to
show
through
he
butchwaxed
the
front
with
a
tube
he
always
carried
in
the
hip
pocket
of
his
jeans
and
as
a
result
the
hair
just
above
his
forehead
looked
like
the
teeth
of
an
oncoming
powermower
an
odor
of
sweat
and
juicy
fruit
gum
always
hung
about
him
he
wore
a
pink
motorcycle
jacket
with
an
eagle
on
the
back
to
school
once
a
fourthgrader
was
unwise
enough
to
laugh
at
that
jacket
henry
had
turned
on
the
little
squirt
umber
as
a
weasel
and
quick
as
an
adder
and
doublepumped
the
squirt
with
one
workgrimed
fist
the
squirt
lost
three
front
teeth
henry
got
a
twoweek
vacation
from
school
ben
had
hoped
with
the
unfocused
yet
burning
hope
of
the
downtrodden
and
terrorized
that
henry
would
be
expelled
instead
of
suspended
no
such
luck
bad
pennies
always
turned
up
his
suspension
over
henry
had
swaggered
back
into
the
schoolyard
balefully
resplendent
in
his
pink
motorcycle
jacket
hair
butchwaxed
so
heavily
that
it
seemed
to
scream
up
from
his
skull
both
eyes
bore
the
puffed
colorful
traces
of
the
beating
his
crazy
father
had
administered
for
fighting
in
the
playyard
the
traces
of
the
beating
eventually
faded
for
the
kids
who
had
to
somehow
coexist
with
henry
at
derry
the
lesson
did
not
to
the
best
of
ben
knowledge
no
one
had
said
anything
about
henry
pink
motorcycle
jacket
with
the
eagle
on
the
back
since
then
when
he
whispered
grimly
at
ben
to
let
him
copy
three
thoughts
had
gone
skyrocketing
through
ben
mind
which
was
every
bit
as
lean
and
quick
as
his
body
was
obese
ina
space
of
seconds
the
first
was
that
if
mrs
douglas
caught
henry
cheating
answers
off
his
paper
both
of
them
would
get
zeros
on
their
tests
the
second
was
that
if
he
didn't
let
henry
copy
henry
would
almost
surely
catch
him
after
school
and
administer
the
fabled
double
pump
to
him
probably
with
huggins
holding
one
of
his
arms
and
criss
holding
the
other
these
were
the
thoughts
of
a
child
and
there
was
nothing
surprising
about
that
because
he
was
achild
the
third
and
last
thought
however
was
more
sophisticated
almost
adult
he
might
get
me
all
right
but
maybe
i
can
keep
out
of
his
way
for
the
last
week
of
school
i'm
pretty
sure
i
can
if
i
really
try
and
he'll
forget
over
the
summer
i
think
yeah
he
pretty
stupid
if
he
flunks
this
test
maybe
he'll
stay
back
again
and
if
he
stays
back
i'll
get
ahead
of
him
i
won't
be
in
the
same
room
with
him
anymore
i'll
get
to
junior
high
before
he
does
i
i
might
be
free
let
me
copy
henry
whispered
again
his
black
eyes
were
now
blazing
demanding
ben
shook
his
head
and
curled
his
arm
more
tightly
around
his
paper
tl
get
you
fatboy
henry
whispered
a
little
louder
now
his
paper
was
so
far
an
utter
blank
save
for
his
name
he
was
desperate
if
he
flunked
his
exams
and
stayed
back
again
his
father
would
beat
his
brans
out
you
let
me
copy
or
i'll
get
you
bad
ben
shook
his
head
again
his
jowls
quivering
he
was
scared
but
he
was
also
determined
he
realized
that
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
had
consciously
committed
himself
to
a
course
of
action
and
that
also
frightened
him
although
he
didn't
exactly
know
why
it
would
be
long
years
before
he
would
realize
it
was
the
coldbloodedness
of
his
calculations
the
careful
and
pragmatic
counting
of
the
cost
with
its
intimations
of
onrushing
adulthood
that
had
scared
him
even
more
than
henry
had
scared
him
henry
he
might
be
able
to
dodge
adulthood
where
he
would
probably
think
in
such
a
way
almost
all
the
time
would
get
him
in
the
end
is
someone
talking
back
there
mrs
douglas
had
said
then
very
dearly
if
so
i
want
it
to
stop
right
now
silence
had
prevailed
for
the
next
ten
minutes
young
heads
remained
studiously
bent
over
examination
sheets
which
smelled
of
fragrant
purple
mimeograph
ink
and
then
henry
whisper
had
floated
across
the
aisle
again
thin
just
audible
chilling
in
the
calm
assurance
of
its
promise
you're
dead
fatboy
ben
took
his
rankcard
and
escaped
grateful
to
whatever
gods
there
are
for
eleven
yearold
fatboys
that
henry
bowers
had
not
by
virtue
of
alphabetical
order
been
allowed
to
escape
the
classroom
first
so
he
could
lay
for
ben
outside
he
did
not
run
down
the
corridor
like
the
other
children
he
could
run
and
quite
fast
for
a
kid
his
size
but
he
was
acutely
aware
of
how
funny
he
looked
when
he
dd
he
walked
fast
though
and
emerged
from
the
cool
booksmelling
hall
and
into
the
bright
june
sunshine
he
stood
with
his
face
turned
up
into
that
sunshine
for
a
moment
grateful
for
its
warmth
and
his
freedom
september
was
a
million
years
from
today
the
calendar
might
say
something
different
but
what
the
calendar
said
was
a
lie
the
summer
would
be
much
longer
than
the
sum
of
its
days
and
it
belonged
to
him
he
felt
as
tall
as
the
standpipe
and
as
wide
as
the
whole
town
someone
bumped
him
bumped
him
hard
pleasant
thoughts
of
the
summer
lying
before
him
were
driven
from
ben
mind
as
he
tottered
wildly
for
balance
on
the
edge
of
the
stone
steps
he
grabbed
the
iron
railing
just
in
time
to
save
himself
from
a
nasty
tumble
get
out
of
my
vay
you
tub
of
guts
it
was
victor
criss
his
hair
combed
back
in
an
elvis
pompadour
and
gleaming
with
brylcreem
he
went
down
the
steps
and
along
the
walk
to
the
front
gate
hands
in
the
pockets
of
his
jeans
shirtcollar
turned
up
hoodstyle
cleats
on
his
engineer
boots
dragging
and
tapping
ben
his
heart
still
beating
rapidly
from
his
fright
saw
that
belch
huggins
was
standing
across
the
street
having
a
butt
he
raised
a
hand
to
victor
and
passed
him
the
cigarette
when
victor
joined
him
victor
took
a
drag
handed
it
back
to
belch
then
pointed
to
where
ben
stood
now
halfway
down
the
steps
he
said
something
and
they
both
broke
up
ben
face
flamed
dully
they
always
got
you
it
was
like
fate
or
something
you
like
this
place
so
well
you're
gonna
stand
here
all
day
a
voice
said
at
his
elbow
ben
turned
and
his
face
became
hotter
still
it
was
beverly
marsh
her
auburn
hair
a
dazzling
cloud
around
her
head
and
upon
her
shoulders
her
eyes
a
lovely
graygreen
her
sweater
pushed
to
her
elbows
was
frayed
around
the
neck
and
almost
as
baggy
as
ben
sweatshirt
too
baggy
certainly
to
tell
if
she
was
getting
any
chestworks
yet
but
ben
didn't
care
when
love
comes
before
puberty
it
can
come
in
waves
so
clear
and
so
powerful
that
no
one
can
stand
against
its
simple
imperative
and
ben
made
no
effort
to
do
so
now
he
simply
gave
in
he
felt
both
foolish
and
exalted
as
miserably
embarrassed
as
he
had
ever
been
in
his
life
and
yet
inarguably
blessed
these
hopeless
emotions
mixed
in
a
heady
brew
that
left
him
feeling
both
sick
and
joyful
n
he
croaked
guess
not
a
large
grin
spread
across
his
face
he
knew
how
idiotic
it
must
look
but
he
could
not
seem
to
pull
it
back
well
good
cause
school
out
you
know
thank
god
have

another
croak
he
had
to
clear
his
throat
and
his
blush
deepened
have
a
nice
summer
beverly
you
too
ben
see
you
next
year
she
went
quickly
down
the
steps
and
ben
saw
everything
with
his
lover
eye
the
bright
tartan
of
her
skirt
the
bounce
of
her
red
hair
against
the
back
of
her
sweater
her
milky
complexion
a
small
healing
cut
across
the
back
of
one
calf
and
for
some
reason
this
last
caused
another
wave
of
feeling
to
sweep
him
so
powerfully
he
had
to
grope
for
the
railing
again
the
feeling
was
huge
inarticulate
mercifully
brief
perhaps
a
sexual
presignal
meaningless
to
his
body
where
the
endocrine
glands
still
slept
almost
without
dreaming
yet
as
bright
as
summer
heat
lightning
a
bright
golden
anklebracelet
she
wore
just
above
her
right
loafer
winking
back
the
sun
in
brilliant
little
flashes
a
sound
some
sort
of
sound
escaped
him
he
went
down
the
steps
like
a
feeble
old
man
and
stood
at
the
bottom
watching
until
she
turned
left
and
disappeared
beyond
the
high
hedge
that
separated
the
schoolyard
from
the
sidewalk
he
only
stood
there
for
a
moment
and
then
while
the
kids
were
still
streaming
past
in
yelling
running
groups
he
remembered
henry
bowers
and
hurried
around
the
building
he
crossed
the
littlekid
playground
running
his
fingers
across
the
swingchains
to
make
them
jingle
and
stepping
over
the
teetertotter
boards
he
went
out
the
much
smaller
gate
which
gave
on
charter
street
and
headed
off
to
the
left
never
looking
back
at
the
stone
pile
where
he
had
spent
most
of
his
weekdays
over
the
last
nine
months
he
stuffed
his
rankcard
in
his
back
pocket
and
started
to
whistle
he
was
wearing
a
pair
of
keds
but
so
far
as
he
could
tell
their
soles
never
touched
the
sidewalk
for
eight
blocks
or
so
school
had
let
out
just
past
noon
his
mother
would
not
be
home
until
at
least
six
because
on
fridays
she
went
right
to
the
shop
n
save
after
work
the
rest
of
the
day
was
his
he
went
down
to
mccarron
park
for
awhile
and
sat
under
a
tree
not
doing
anything
but
occasionally
whispering
i
love
beverly
marsh
under
his
breath
feeling
more
lightheaded
and
romantic
each
time
he
said
it
at
one
point
as
a
bunch
of
boys
drifted
into
the
park
and
began
choosing
up
sides
for
a
scratch
baseball
game
he
whispered
the
words
beverly
hanscom
twice
and
then
had
to
put
his
face
into
the
grass
until
it
cooled
his
burning
cheeks
shortly
after
that
he
got
up
and
headed
across
the
park
toward
costello
avenue
a
walk
of
five
more
blocks
would
take
him
to
the
public
library
which
he
supposed
had
been
his
destination
all
along
he
was
almost
out
of
the
park
when
a
sixthgrader
named
peter
gordon
saw
him
and
yelled
hey
tits
wanna
play
we
need
somebody
to
be
rightfield
there
was
an
explosion
of
laughter
ben
escaped
it
as
fast
as
he
could
hunching
his
neck
down
into
his
collar
like
a
turtle
drawing
into
its
shell
still
he
considered
himself
lucky
all
in
all
on
another
day
the
boys
might
have
chased
him
maybe
just
to
rank
him
out
maybe
to
roll
him
in
the
dirt
and
see
if
he
would
cry
today
they
were
too
absorbed
in
getting
the
game
going
whether
or
not
you
could
use
fingers
or
get
topsies
when
you
threw
the
bat
for
first
picks
which
team
would
get
their
guaranteed
last
ups
all
the
rest
ben
happily
left
them
to
the
arcana
preceding
the
first
ballgame
of
the
summer
and
went
on
his
way
three
blocks
down
costello
he
spied
something
interesting
perhaps
even
profitable
under
someone
front
hedge
glass
gleamed
through
the
ripped
side
of
an
old
paper
bag
ben
hooked
the
bag
out
onto
the
sidewalk
with
his
foot
it
seemed
his
luck
really
was
in
there
were
four
beer
bottles
and
four
big
soda
bottles
inside
the
biggies
were
worth
a
nickel
each
the
rheingolds
two
pennies
twentyeight
cents
under
someone
hedge
just
waiting
for
some
kid
to
come
along
and
scoff
it
up
some
lucky
kid
that
me
ben
said
happily
having
no
idea
what
the
rest
of
the
day
had
in
store
he
got
moving
again
holding
the
bag
by
the
bottom
so
it
wouldn't
break
open
the
costello
avenue
market
was
a
block
farther
down
the
street
and
ben
turned
in
he
swapped
the
bottles
for
cash
and
most
of
the
cash
for
candy
he
stood
at
the
pennycandy
window
pointing
delighted
as
always
by
the
ratcheting
sound
the
sliding
door
made
when
the
storekeeper
slid
it
along
its
track
which
was
lined
with
balbearings
he
got
five
red
licorice
whips
and
five
black
ten
rootbeer
barrels
two
for
a
penny
a
nickel
strip
of
buttons
five
to
a
row
five
rows
on
a
nickel
strip
and
you
ate
them
right
off
the
paper
a
packet
of
likem
ade
and
a
package
of
pez
for
his
pezgun
at
home
ben
walked
out
with
a
small
brown
paper
sack
of
candy
in
his
hand
and
four
cents
in
the
right
front
pocket
of
his
new
jeans
he
looked
at
the
brown
bag
with
its
load
of
sweetness
and
a
thought
suddenly
tried
to
surface
you
keep
eating
this
way
beverly
marsh
is
never
going
to
look
at
you
but
it
was
an
unpleasant
thought
and
so
he
pushed
it
away
it
went
easily
enough
his
was
a
thought
used
to
being
banished
if
someone
had
asked
him
ben
are
you
lonely
he
would
have
looked
at
that
someone
with
real
surprise
the
question
had
never
even
occurred
to
him
he
had
no
friends
but
he
had
his
books
and
his
dreams
he
had
his
revell
models
he
had
a
gigantic
set
of
lincoln
logs
and
built
all
sorts
of
stuff
with
them
his
mother
had
exclaimed
more
than
once
that
ben
lincoln
logs
houses
looked
better
than
some
real
ones
that
came
from
blueprints
he
had
a
pretty
good
hector
set
too
he
was
hoping
for
the
super
set
when
his
birthday
came
around
in
october
with
that
one
you
could
build
a
clock
that
really
told
time
and
a
car
with
real
gears
in
it
lonely
he
might
have
asked
in
return
honestly
foozled
huh
what
a
child
blind
from
birth
doesn't
even
know
he
blind
until
someone
tells
him
even
then
he
has
only
the
most
academic
idea
of
what
blindness
is
only
the
formerly
sighted
have
a
real
grip
on
the
thing
ben
hanscom
had
no
sense
of
being
lonely
because
he
ind
never
been
anything
but
if
the
condition
had
been
new
or
more
localized
he
might
have
understood
but
loneliness
both
encompassed
his
life
and
overreached
it
it
simply
was
like
his
double
jointed
thumb
or
the
funny
little
jag
inside
one
of
his
front
teeth
the
little
jag
his
tongue
began
running
over
whenever
he
was
nervous
beverly
was
a
sweet
dream
the
candy
was
a
sweet
reality
the
candy
was
his
friend
so
he
told
the
alien
thought
to
take
a
hike
and
it
went
quietly
without
causing
any
fuss
whatsoever
and
between
the
costello
avenue
market
and
the
library
he
gobbled
all
of
the
candy
in
the
sack
he
honestly
meant
to
save
the
pez
for
watching
tv
that
night
he
liked
to
load
them
into
the
little
plastic
pezgun
handgrip
one
by
one
liked
to
hear
the
accepting
click
of
the
small
spring
inside
and
liked
most
of
all
to
shoot
them
into
his
mouth
one
by
one
like
a
kid
committing
suicide
by
sugar
whirlybirds
was
on
tonight
with
kenneth
tobey
as
the
fearless
helicopter
pilot
and
dragnet
where
the
cases
were
true
but
the
names
had
been
changed
to
protect
the
innocent
and
his
favorite
cop
show
of
all
time
highway
patrol
which
starred
broderick
crawford
as
highway
patrolman
dan
matthews
broderick
crawford
was
ben
personal
hero
broderick
crawford
was
fast
broderick
crawford
was
mean
broderick
crawford
took
absolutely
no
shit
from
nobody
and
best
of
all
broderick
crawford
was
fat
he
arrived
at
the
corner
of
costello
and
kansas
street
where
he
crossed
to
the
public
library
it
was
really
two
buildings
the
old
stone
structure
in
front
built
with
lumber
baron
money
in
and
the
new
low
sandstone
building
behind
which
housed
the
children
library
the
adult
library
in
front
and
the
children
library
behind
were
connected
by
a
glass
corridor
this
close
to
downtown
kansas
street
was
oneway
so
ben
only
looked
in
one
direction
right
before
crossing
if
he
had
looked
left
he
would
have
gotten
a
nasty
shock
standing
in
the
shade
of
a
big
old
oak
tree
on
the
lawn
of
the
derry
community
house
a
block
down
were
belch
huggins
victor
criss
and
henry
bowers
let
get
him
hank
victor
was
almost
panting
henry
watched
the
fat
little
prick
scutter
across
the
street
his
belly
bouncing
the
cowlick
at
the
back
of
his
head
springing
back
and
forth
like
a
goddam
slinky
his
ass
wiggling
like
a
girl
inside
his
new
bluejeans
he
estimated
the
distance
between
the
three
of
them
here
on
the
community
house
lawn
and
hanscom
and
between
hanscom
and
the
safety
of
the
library
he
thought
they
could
probably
get
him
before
he
made
it
inside
but
hanscom
might
start
screaming
he
wouldn't
put
it
past
the
little
pansy
if
he
did
an
adult
might
interfere
and
henry
wanted
no
interference
the
douglas
bitch
had
told
henry
he
had
flunked
both
english
and
math
she
was
passing
him
she
said
but
he
would
have
to
take
four
weeks
of
summer
makeup
henry
would
rather
have
stayed
back
if
he'd
stayed
back
his
father
would
have
beaten
him
up
once
with
henry
at
school
four
hours
a
day
for
four
weeks
of
the
farm
busiest
season
his
father
was
apt
to
beat
him
up
half
a
dozen
times
maybe
even
more
he
was
reconciled
to
this
grim
future
only
because
he
intended
to
pass
everything
on
to
that
fat
little
babyfag
this
afternoon
with
interest
yeah
let
go
belch
said
we'll
wait
for
him
to
come
out
they
watched
ben
open
one
of
the
big
double
doors
and
go
inside
and
then
they
sat
down
and
smoked
cigarettes
and
told
travellingsalesman
jokes
and
waited
for
him
to
come
back
out
eventually
henry
knew
he
would
and
when
he
did
henry
was
going
to
make
him
sorry
he
was
ever
born
ben
loved
the
library
he
loved
the
way
it
was
always
cool
even
on
the
hottest
day
of
a
long
hot
summer
he
loved
its
murmuring
quiet
broken
only
by
occasional
whispers
the
faint
thud
of
a
librarian
stamping
books
and
cards
or
the
riffle
of
pages
being
turned
in
the
periodicals
room
where
the
old
men
hung
out
reading
newspapers
which
had
been
threaded
into
long
sticks
he
loved
the
quality
of
the
light
which
slanted
through
the
high
narrow
windows
in
the
afternoons
or
glowed
in
lazy
pools
thrown
by
the
chainhung
globes
on
winter
evenings
while
the
wind
whined
outside
he
liked
the
smell
of
the
books
a
spicy
smell
faintly
fabulous
he
would
sometimes
walk
through
the
adult
stacks
looking
at
the
thousands
of
volumes
and
imagining
a
world
of
lives
inside
each
one
the
way
he
sometimes
walked
along
his
street
in
the
burning
smokehazed
twilight
of
a
lateoctober
afternoon
the
sun
only
a
bitter
orange
line
on
the
horizon
imagining
the
lives
going
on
behind
all
the
windows
people
laughing
or
arguing
or
arranging
flowers
or
feeding
kids
or
pets
or
their
own
faces
while
they
watched
the
boobtube
he
liked
the
way
the
glass
corridor
connecting
the
old
building
with
the
children
library
was
always
hot
even
in
the
winter
unless
there
had
been
a
couple
of
cloudy
days
mrs
starrett
the
head
children
librarian
told
him
that
was
caused
by
something
called
the
greenhouse
effect
ben
had
been
delighted
with
the
idea
years
later
he
would
build
the
hotly
debated
bbc
communications
center
in
london
and
the
arguments
might
rage
for
a
thousand
years
and
still
no
one
would
know
except
for
ben
himself
that
the
communications
center
was
nothing
but
the
glass
corridor
of
the
derry
public
library
stood
on
end
he
liked
the
children
library
as
well
although
it
had
none
of
the
shadowy
charm
he
felt
in
the
old
library
with
its
globes
and
curving
iron
staircases
too
narrow
for
two
people
to
pass
upon
them
one
always
had
to
back
up
the
children
library
was
bright
and
sunny
a
little
noisier
in
spite
of
the
let
be
quiet
shall
we
signs
that
were
posted
around
most
of
the
noise
usually
came
from
pooh
corner
where
the
little
kids
went
to
look
at
picturebooks
when
ben
came
in
today
story
hour
had
just
begun
there
miss
davies
the
pretty
young
librarian
was
reading
the
three
billy
goats
gruff
who
is
that
triptrapping
upon
my
bridge
'
miss
davies
spoke
in
the
low
growling
tones
of
the
troll
in
the
story
some
of
the
little
ones
covered
their
mouths
and
giggled
but
most
only
watched
her
solemnly
accepting
the
voice
of
the
troll
as
they
accepted
the
voices
of
their
dreams
and
their
grave
eyes
reflected
the
eternal
fascination
of
the
fairytale
would
the
monster
be
bested
or
would
it
feed
bright
posters
were
tacked
everywhere
here
was
a
good
cartoon
kid
who
had
brushed
his
teeth
until
his
mouth
foamed
like
the
muzzle
of
a
mad
dog
here
was
a
bad
cartoon
kid
who
was
smoking
cigarettes
when
i
grow
up
i
want
to
be
sick
a
lot
just
like
my
dad
it
said
underneath
here
was
a
wonderful
photograph
of
a
billion
tiny
pinpoints
of
light
flaring
in
darkness

motto
beneath

there
were
invitations
to
join
the
scouting
experience
a
poster
advancing
the
idea
that
the
girls
clubs
of
today
build
the
women
of
tomorrow
there
were
softball
signup
sheets
and
community
house
children
theater
signup
sheets
and
of
course
one
inviting
kids
to
join
the
summer
reading
program
ben
was
a
big
fan
of
the
summer
reading
program
you
got
a
map
of
the
united
states
when
you
signed
up
then
for
every
book
you
read
and
made
a
report
on
you
got
astate
sticker
to
lick
and
put
on
your
map
the
sticker
came
complete
with
info
like
the
state
bird
the
state
flower
the
year
admitted
to
the
union
and
what
presidents
if
any
had
ever
come
from
that
state
when
you
got
all
fortyeight
stuck
on
your
map
you
got
a
free
book
helluva
good
deal
ben
planned
to
do
just
as
the
poster
suggested
waste
no
time
sign
up
today
conspicuous
amid
this
bright
and
amiable
riot
of
color
was
a
simple
stark
poster
taped
to
the
checkout
desk
no
cartoons
or
fancy
photographs
here
just
black
print
on
white
poster
paper
reading
remember
the
curfew
p.m
derry
police
department
just
looking
at
it
gave
ben
a
chill
in
the
excitement
of
getting
his
rankcard
worrying
about
henry
bowers
talking
with
beverly
and
starting
summer
vacation
he
had
forgotten
all
about
the
curfew
and
the
murders
people
argued
about
how
many
there
had
been
but
everyone
agreed
that
there
had
been
at
least
four
since
last
winter
five
if
you
counted
george
denbrough
many
held
the
opinion
that
the
little
denbrough
boy
death
must
have
been
some
kind
of
bizarre
freak
accident
the
first
everyone
was
sure
of
was
betty
ripsom
who
had
been
found
the
day
after
christmas
in
the
area
of
turnpike
construction
on
outer
jackson
street
the
girl
who
was
thirteen
had
been
found
mutilated
and
frozen
into
the
muddy
earth
this
had
not
been
in
the
paper
nor
was
it
a
thing
any
adult
had
spoken
of
to
ben
it
was
just
something
he
had
picked
up
around
the
corners
of
overheard
conversations
about
three
and
a
half
months
later
not
long
after
the
troutfishing
season
had
begun
a
fisherman
working
the
bank
of
a
stream
twenty
miles
east
of
derry
had
hooked
onto
something
he
believed
at
first
to
be
a
stick
it
had
turned
out
to
be
the
hand
wrist
and
first
four
inches
of
a
girl
forearm
his
hook
had
snagged
this
awful
trophy
by
the
web
of
flesh
between
the
thumb
and
first
finger
the
state
police
had
found
the
rest
of
cheryl
lamonica
seventy
yards
farther
downstream
caught
in
a
tree
that
had
fallen
across
the
stream
the
previous
winter
it
was
only
luck
that
the
body
had
not
been
washed
into
the
penobscot
and
then
out
to
sea
in
the
spring
runoff
the
lamonica
girl
had
been
sixteen
she
was
from
derry
but
did
not
attend
school
three
years
before
she
had
given
birth
to
a
daughter
andrea
she
and
her
daughter
lived
at
home
with
cheryl
parents
cheryl
was
a
little
wild
sometimes
but
she
was
a
good
girl
at
heart
her
sobbing
father
had
told
police
andi
keeps
asking
where
my
mommy
and
i
don't
know
what
to
tell
her
the
girl
had
been
reported
missing
five
weeks
before
the
body
was
found
the
police
investigation
of
cheryl
lamonica’s
death
began
with
a
logical
enough
assumption
that
she
had
been
murdered
by
one
of
her
boyfriends
she
had
lots
of
boyfriends
many
were
from
the
air
base
up
bangor
way
they
were
nice
boys
most
of
them
cheryl
mother
said
one
of
the
nice
boy
had
been
a
fortyyearold
air
force
colonel
with
a
wife
and
three
children
in
new
mexico
another
was
currently
serving
time
in
shawshank
for
armed
robbery
a
boyfriend
the
police
thought
or
just
possibly
a
stranger
a
sexfiend
if
it
was
a
sexfiend
he
was
apparently
a
fiend
for
boys
as
well
in
late
april
a
juniorhigh
teacher
on
a
mture
walk
with
his
eighthgrade
class
had
spied
a
pair
of
red
sneakers
and
a
pair
of
blue
corduroy
rompers
protruding
from
the
mouth
of
a
culvert
on
merit
street
that
end
of
merit
had
been
blocked
off
with
sawhorses
the
asphalt
had
been
bulldozed
up
the
previous
fall
the
turnpike
extension
would
cross
there
as
well
on
its
way
north
to
bangor
the
body
had
been
that
of
threeyearold
matthew
clements
reported
missing
by
his
parents
only
the
day
before
his
picture
had
been
on
the
front
page
of
the
derry
news
a
dark
haired
little
kid
grinning
brashly
into
the
camera
a
red
sox
cap
perched
on
his
head
the
clements
family
lived
on
kansas
street
all
the
way
on
the
other
side
of
town
his
mother
so
stunned
by
her
grief
that
she
seemed
to
exist
in
a
glass
ball
of
utter
calm
told
police
that
matty
had
been
riding
his
tricycle
up
and
down
the
sidewalk
beside
the
house
which
stood
on
the
comer
of
kansas
street
and
kossuth
lane
she
went
to
put
her
washing
in
the
drier
and
when
she
next
looked
out
the
window
to
check
on
matty
he
was
gone
there
had
only
been
his
overturned
trike
on
the
grass
between
the
sidewalk
and
the
street
one
of
the
back
wheels
was
still
spinning
lazily
as
she
looked
it
came
to
a
stop
that
was
enough
for
chief
borton
he
proposed
the
seven
o'clock
curfew
at
a
special
session
of
the
city
council
the
following
evening
it
was
adopted
unanimously
and
went
into
effect
the
next
day
small
children
were
to
be
watched
by
a
qualified
adult
at
all
times
according
to
the
story
which
reported
the
curfew
in
the
news
at
ben
school
there
had
been
a
special
assembly
a
month
ago
the
chief
went
on
stage
hooked
his
thumbs
into
his
gunbelt
and
assured
the
children
they
had
nothing
at
all
to
worry
about
as
long
as
they
followed
a
few
smple
rules
don't
talk
to
strangers
don't
accept
rides
with
people
unless
you
know
them
well
always
remember
that
the
policeman
is
your
friend
and
obey
the
curfew
two
weeks
ago
a
boy
ben
knew
only
vaguely
he
was
in
the
other
fifthgrade
classroom
at
derry
elementary
had
looked
into
one
of
the
stormdrains
out
by
neibolt
street
and
had
seen
what
looked
like
a
lot
of
hair
floating
around
in
there
this
boy
whose
name
was
either
frankie
or
freddy
ross
or
maybe
roth
had
been
out
prospecting
for
goodies
with
a
gadget
of
his
own
invention
which
he
called
the
fabulous
gumstick
when
he
talked
about
it
you
could
tell
he
thought
about
it
like
that
in
capital
letters
and
maybe
neon
as
well
the
fabulous
gumstick
was
a
birch
branch
with
a
big
wad
of
bubblegum
stuck
on
the
tip
in
his
spare
time
freddy
or
frankie
walked
around
derry
with
it
peering
into
sewers
and
drains
sometimes
he
saw
money
pennies
mostly
but
sometimes
a
dime
or
even
a
quarter
he
referred
to
these
latter
for
some
reason
known
only
to
him
as
quaymonsters'
once
the
money
was
spotted
frankieorfreddy
and
the
fabulous
gumstick
would
swing
into
action
one
downward
poke
through
the
grating
and
the
coin
was
as
good
as
in
his
pocket
ben
had
heard
rumors
of
frankieorfreddy
and
his
gum
stick
long
before
the
kid
had
vaulted
into
the
limelight
by
discovering
the
body
of
veronica
grogan
he
really
gross
a
kid
named
richie
tozier
had
confided
to
ben
one
day
during
activity
period
tozier
was
a
scrawny
kid
who
wore
glasses
ben
thought
that
without
them
tozier
probably
saw
every
bit
as
well
as
mr
magoo
his
magnified
eyes
swam
behind
the
thick
lenses
with
an
expression
of
perpetual
surprise
he
also
had
huge
front
teeth
that
had
earned
him
the
nickname
bucky
beaver
he
was
in
the
same
fifthgrade
class
as
freddyorfrankie
pokes
that
gum
stick
of
his
down
sewerdrains
all
day
long
and
then
chews
the
gum
from
the
end
of
it
at
night
oh
gosh
that
bad
ben
had
exclaimed
dat
wight
wabbi
tozier
said
and
walked
away
frankieorfreddy
had
worked
the
fabulous
gumstick
back
and
forth
through
the
grate
of
the
stormdrain
believing
he'd
found
a
wig
he
thought
maybe
he
could
dry
it
out
and
give
it
to
his
mother
for
her
birthday
or
something
after
a
few
minutes
of
poking
and
prodding
just
as
he
was
about
to
give
up
a
face
had
floated
out
of
the
murky
water
in
the
plugged
drain
a
face
with
dead
leaves
plastered
to
its
white
cheeks
and
dirt
in
its
staring
eyes
freddyorfrankie
ran
home
screaming
veronica
grogan
had
been
in
the
fourth
grade
at
the
neibolt
street
church
school
which
was
run
by
people
ben
mother
called
the
christers
she
was
buried
on
what
would
have
been
her
tenth
birthday
after
this
most
recent
horror
arlene
hanscom
had
taken
ben
into
the
living
room
one
evening
and
sat
beside
him
on
the
couch
she
picked
up
his
hands
and
looked
intently
into
his
face
ben
looked
back
feeling
a
little
uneasy
ben
she
said
presently
are
you
a
fool
no
mamma
ben
said
feeling
more
uneasy
than
ever
he
_
hadnt
the
slightest
idea
what
this
was
about
he
could
not
remember
ever
seeing
his
mamma
look
so
grave
n
she
echoed
i
don't
believe
you
are
she
fell
silent
for
a
long
time
then
not
looking
at
ben
but
pensively
out
the
window
ben
wondered
briefly
if
she
had
forgotten
all
about
him
she
was
a
young
woman
still
only
thirtytwo
but
raising
a
boy
by
herself
had
put
a
mark
on
her
she
worked
forty
hours
a
week
in
the
spookandbale
room
at
stark
mills
in
newport
and
after
workdays
when
the
dust
and
lint
had
been
particularly
bad
she
sometimes
coughed
so
long
and
hard
that
ben
would
become
frightened
on
those
nights
he
would
lie
awake
for
a
long
time
looking
through
the
window
beside
his
bed
into
the
darkness
wondering
what
would
become
of
him
if
she
died
he
would
be
an
orphan
then
he
supposed
he
might
become
a
state
kid
he
thought
that
meant
you
had
to
go
live
with
farmers
who
made
you
work
from
sunup
to
sunset
or
he
might
be
sent
to
the
bangor
orphan
asylum
he
tried
to
tell
himself
it
was
foolish
to
worry
about
such
things
but
the
telling
did
absolutely
no
good
nor
was
it
just
himself
he
was
worried
about
he
worried
for
her
as
well
she
was
a
hard
woman
his
mamma
and
she
insisted
on
having
her
own
way
about
most
things
but
she
was
a
good
mamma
he
loved
her
very
much
you
know
about
these
murders
she
said
looking
back
at
last
he
nodded
at
first
people
thought
they
were
she
hesitated
over
the
next
word
never
spoken
in
her
son
presence
before
but
the
circumstances
were
unusual
and
she
forced
herself
sex
crimes
maybe
they
were
and
maybe
they
weren't
maybe
they're
over
and
maybe
they're
not
no
one
can
be
sure
of
anything
anymore
except
that
some
crazy
man
who
preys
on
little
children
is
out
there
do
you
understand
me
ben
he
nodded
and
you
know
what
i
mean
when
i
say
they
may
have
been
sex
crimes
he
didn't
at
least
not
exactly
but
he
nodded
again
if
his
mother
felt
she
had
to
talk
to
him
about
the
birds
and
bees
as
well
as
this
other
business
he
thought
he
would
die
of
embarrassment
i
worry
about
you
ben
i
worry
that
i'm
not
doing
right
by
you
ben
squirmed
and
said
nothing
you're
on
your
own
a
lot
too
much
i
guess
you
mamma
hush
while
i'm
talking
to
you
she
said
and
ben
hushed
you
have
to
be
careful
benny
summer
coming
and
i
don't
want
to
spoil
your
vacation
but
you
have
to
be
careful
i
want
you
in
by
suppertime
every
day
what
time
do
we
eat
supper
six
o'clock
right
with
eversharp
so
hear
what
i'm
saying
if
i
set
the
table
and
pour
your
milk
and
see
that
there
no
ben
washing
his
hands
at
the
sink
i'm
going
to
go
right
away
to
the
telephone
and
call
the
police
and
report
you
missing
do
you
understand
that
yes
mamma
and
you
believe
i
mean
exactly
what
i
sa
yes
tt
would
probably
turn
out
that
i
did
it
for
nothing
if
i
ever
had
to
do
it
at
all
i'm
not
entirely
ignorant
cout
the
ways
of
boys
i
know
they
get
wrapped
up
in
their
own
games
and
projects
during
summer
vacation
lining
bees
back
to
their
hives
or
playing
ball
or
kickthe
can
or
whatever
i
have
a
pretty
good
idea
what
you
and
your
friends
are
up
to
you
see
ben
nodded
soberly
thinking
that
if
she
didn't
know
he
had
no
friends
she
probably
didn't
know
anywhere
near
as
much
about
his
boyhood
as
she
thought
she
did
but
he
would
never
have
dreamed
of
saying
such
a
thing
to
her
not
in
ten
thousand
years
of
dreaming
she
took
something
from
the
pocket
of
her
housedress
and
handed
it
to
him
it
was
a
small
plastic
box
ben
opened
it
when
he
saw
what
was
inside
his
mouth
dropped
open
wow
he
said
his
admiration
totally
unaffected
thank
it
was
a
timex
watch
with
small
silver
numbers
and
an
imitationleather
band
she
had
set
it
and
wound
it
he
could
hear
it
ticking
jeez
it
the
coolest
he
gave
her
an
enthusiastic
hug
and
a
loud
kiss
on
the
cheek
she
smiled
pleased
that
he
was
pleased
and
nodded
then
she
grew
grave
again
put
it
on
keep
it
on
wear
it
wind
it
mind
it
don't
lose
it
okay
now
that
you
have
a
watch
you
have
no
reason
to
be
late
home
remember
what
i
said
if
you're
not
on
time
the
police
will
be
looking
for
you
on
my
behalf
at
least
until
they
catch
the
bastard
who
is
killing
children
around
here
don't
you
dare
be
a
single
minute
late
or
i'll
be
on
that
telephone
yes
mamma
one
other
thing
i
don't
want
you
going
around
alone
you
know
enough
not
to
accept
candy
or
rides
from
strangers
we
both
agree
that
you're
no
fool
and
you're
big
for
your
age
but
a
grown
man
particularly
a
crazy
one
can
overpower
a
child
if
he
really
wants
to
when
you
go
to
the
park
or
the
library
go
with
one
of
your
friends
will
mamma
she
looked
out
the
window
again
and
uttered
a
sigh
that
was
full
of
trouble
things
have
come
to
a
pretty
pass
when
a
thing
like
this
can
go
on
there
something
ugly
about
this
town
anyway
i've
always
thought
so
she
looked
back
at
him
brows
drawn
down
you're
such
a
wanderer
ben
you
must
know
almost
everyplace
in
derry
don't
you
the
town
part
of
it
at
least
ben
didn't
think
he
knew
anywhere
near
all
the
places
but
he
did
know
a
lot
of
them
and
he
was
so
thrilled
by
the
unexpected
gift
of
the
timex
that
he
would
have
agreed
with
his
mother
that
night
if
she
had
suggested
john
wayne
should
play
adolf
hitler
in
a
musical
comedy
about
world
war
ii
he
nodded
you've
never
seen
anything
have
you
she
asked
anything
or
anyone
well
suspicious
anything
out
of
the
ordinary
anything
that
scared
you
and
in
his
pleasure
over
the
watch
his
feeling
of
love
for
her
his
smallboy
gladness
at
her
concern
which
was
at
the
same
time
a
little
frightening
in
its
unhidden
unabashed
fierceness
he
almost
told
her
about
the
thing
that
had
happened
last
january
he
opened
his
mouth
and
then
something
some
powerful
intuition
closed
it
again
what
was
that
something
exactly
intuition
no
more
than
that
and
no
less
even
children
may
intuit
love
more
complex
responsibilities
from
time
to
time
and
to
sense
that
in
some
cases
it
may
be
kinder
to
remain
quiet
that
was
part
of
the
reason
ben
closed
his
mouth
but
there
was
something
else
as
well
something
not
so
noble
she
could
be
hard
his
mamma
she
could
be
a
boss
she
never
called
nun
fat
she
called
him
big
sometimes
amplified
to
big
for
his
age’
and
when
there
were
leftovers
from
supper
she
would
often
bring
them
to
him
while
he
was
watching
tv
or
doing
his
homework
and
he
would
eat
them
although
some
dim
part
of
him
hated
himself
for
doing
so
but
never
his
mamma
for
putting
the
food
before
him
ben
hanscom
would
not
have
dared
to
hate
his
mamma
god
would
surely
strike
him
dead
for
feeling
such
a
brutish
ungrateful
emotion
even
for
a
second
and
perhaps
some
even
dimmer
part
of
him
the
faroff
tibet
of
ben
deeper
thoughts
suspected
her
motives
in
this
constant
feeding
was
it
just
love
could
it
be
anything
else
surely
not
but
he
wondered
more
to
the
point
she
didn't
know
he
had
no
friends
that
lack
of
knowledge
made
nun
distrust
her
made
him
unsure
of
what
her
reaction
would
be
to
his
story
of
the
thing
which
had
happened
to
him
in
january
if
anything
had
happened
coming
in
at
six
and
staying
in
was
not
so
bad
maybe
he
could
read
watch
tv
eat
build
stuff
with
his
logs
and
erector
set
but
having
to
stay
in
all
day
as
well
would
be
very
bad
and
if
he
told
her
what
he
had
seen
or
thought
he
had
seen
in
january
she
might
make
him
do
just
that
so
for
a
variety
of
reasons
ben
withheld
the
story
no
mamma
he
said
just
mr
mckibbon
rooting
around
in
other
people
garbage
that
made
her
laugh
she
didn't
like
mr
mckibbon
who
was
a
republican
as
well
as
a
christer
and
her
laugh
closed
the
subject
that
night
ben
had
lain
awake
late
but
no
thoughts
of
being
cast
adrift
and
parentless
in
a
hard
world
troubled
him
he
felt
loved
and
safe
as
he
lay
in
his
bed
looking
at
the
moonlight
which
came
in
through
the
window
and
spilled
across
the
bed
onto
the
floor
he
alternately
put
his
watch
to
his
ear
so
he
could
listen
to
it
tick
and
held
it
close
to
his
eyes
so
he
could
admire
its
ghostly
radium
dial
he
had
finally
fallen
asleep
and
dreamed
he
was
playing
baseball
with
the
other
boys
in
the
vacant
lot
behind
tracker
brothers
truck
depot
he
had
just
hit
a
basesclearing
home
run
swinging
from
his
heels
and
getting
every
inch
of
that
litte
honey
and
his
cheering
teammates
met
him
in
a
mob
at
home
plate
they
pummelled
him
and
clapped
him
on
the
back
they
hoisted
him
onto
their
shoulders
and
carried
him
toward
the
place
where
their
equipment
was
scattered
in
the
dream
he
was
almost
bursting
with
pride
and
happiness
and
then
he
had
looked
out
toward
center
field
where
a
chainlink
fence
marked
the
boundary
between
the
cindery
lot
and
the
weedy
ground
beyond
that
sloped
into
the
barrens
a
figure
was
standing
in
those
tangled
weeds
and
low
bushes
almost
out
of
sight
it
held
a
clutch
of
balloons
red
yellow
blue
green
in
one
whitegloved
hand
it
beckoned
with
the
other
he
couldn't
see
the
figure
face
but
he
could
see
the
baggy
suit
with
the
big
orange
pompon
buttons
down
the
front
and
the
floppy
yellow
bowtie
it
was
a
clown
dot
wight
wabbit
a
phantom
voice
agreed
when
ben
awoke
the
next
morning
he
had
forgotten
the
dream
but
his
pillow
was
damp
to
the
touch
as
if
he
had
wept
in
the
night
he
went
up
to
the
main
desk
in
the
children
library
shaking
the
train
of
thought
the
curfew
sign
had
begun
as
easily
as
a
dog
shakes
water
after
a
swim
hullo
benny
mrs
starrett
said
like
mrs
douglas
at
school
she
genuinely
liked
ben
grownups
especially
those
who
sometimes
needed
to
discipline
children
as
part
of
their
jobs
generally
liked
him
because
he
was
polite
softspoken
thoughtful
sometimes
even
funny
in
a
very
quiet
way
these
were
all
the
same
reasons
most
kids
thought
he
was
a
puke
you
tired
of
summer
vacation
yet
ben
smiled
this
was
a
standard
witticism
with
mrs
starrett
not
yet
he
said
since
summer
vacation
only
been
going
on
he
looked
at
his
watch
one
hour
and
seventeen
minutes
give
me
another
hour
mrs
starrett
laughed
covering
her
mouth
so
it
wouldn't
be
too
loud
she
asked
ben
if
he
wanted
to
sign
up
for
the
summer
reading
program
and
ben
said
he
did
she
gave
him
a
map
of
the
united
states
and
ben
thanked
her
very
much
he
wandered
off
into
the
stacks
pulling
a
book
here
and
there
looking
at
it
putting
it
back
choosing
books
was
serious
business
you
had
to
be
careful
if
you
were
a
grownup
you
could
have
as
many
as
you
wanted
but
kids
could
only
take
out
three
at
a
time
if
you
picked
a
dud
you
were
stuck
with
it
he
finally
picked
out
his
three
bulldozer
the
black
stallion
and
one
that
was
sort
of
a
shot
in
the
dark
a
book
called
hot
rod
by
a
man
named
henry
gregor
felsen
you
may
not
like
this
one
mrs
starrett
remarked
stamping
the
book
it
extremely
bloody
i
urge
it
on
the
teenagers
especially
the
ones
who
have
just
got
their
driving
licenses
because
it
gives
them
something
to
think
about
i
imagine
it
slows
some
of
them
down
for
a
whole
week
well
i'll
give
it
a
whirl
ben
said
and
took
his
books
over
to
one
of
the
tables
away
from
pooh
corner
where
big
billy
goat
gruff
was
in
the
process
of
giving
a
double
dose
of
dickens
to
the
troll
under
the
bridge
he
worked
on
hot
rod
for
awhile
and
it
was
not
too
shabby
not
too
shabby
at
all
it
was
about
a
kid
who
was
a
really
great
driver
but
there
was
this
partypooper
cop
who
was
always
trying
to
slow
him
down
ben
found
out
there
were
no
speed
limits
in
iowa
where
the
book
was
set
that
was
sort
of
cool
he
looked
up
after
three
chapters
and
his
eye
was
caught
by
a
brandnew
display
the
poster
on
top
the
library
was
gungho
for
posters
all
right
showed
a
happy
mailman
delivering
a
letter
to
a
happy
kid
libraries
are
for
writing
too
the
poster
said
why
not
write
a
friend
today
the
smiles
are
guaranteed
beneath
the
poster
were
slots
filled
with
prestamped
postcards
prestamped
envelopes
and
stationery
with
a
drawing
of
the
derry
public
library
on
top
in
blue
ink
the
pre
stamped
envelopes
were
a
nickel
each
the
postcards
three
cents
the
paper
was
two
sheets
for
a
penny
ben
felt
in
his
pocket
the
remaining
four
cents
of
his
bottle
money
was
still
there
he
marked
his
place
in
hot
rod
and
went
back
to
the
desk
may
i
have
one
of
those
postcards
please
certainly
ben
as
always
mrs
starrett
was
charmed
by
his
grave
politeness
and
a
little
saddened
by
his
size
her
mother
would
have
said
the
boy
was
digging
his
grave
with
a
knife
and
fork
she
gave
him
the
card
and
watched
him
go
back
to
his
seat
it
was
a
table
that
could
seat
six
but
ben
was
the
only
one
there
she
had
never
seen
ben
with
any
of
the
other
boys
it
was
too
bad
because
she
believed
ben
hanscom
had
treasures
buried
inside
he
would
yield
them
up
to
a
kind
and
patient
prospector
if
one
ever
came
along
ben
took
out
his
ballpoint
pen
clicked
the
point
down
and
addressed
the
card
simply
enough
miss
beverly
marsh
lower
main
street
derry
maine
zone
he
did
not
know
the
exact
number
of
her
building
but
his
mamma
had
told
him
that
most
postmen
had
a
pretty
good
idea
of
who
their
customers
were
once
they'd
been
on
their
beats
a
little
while
if
the
postman
who
had
lower
main
street
could
deliver
this
card
that
would
be
great
if
not
it
would
just
go
to
the
deadletter
office
and
he
would
be
out
three
cents
it
would
certainly
never
come
back
to
him
because
he
had
no
intention
of
putting
his
name
and
address
on
it
carrying
the
card
with
the
address
turned
inward
he
was
taking
no
chances
even
though
he
didn't
see
anyone
he
recognized
he
got
a
few
square
slips
of
paper
from
the
wooden
box
by
the
cardfile
he
took
these
back
to
his
seat
and
began
to
scribble
to
cross
out
and
then
to
scribble
again
during
the
last
week
of
school
before
exams
they
had
been
reading
and
writing
haiku
in
english
class
haiku
was
a
japanese
form
of
poetry
brief
disciplined
a
haiku
mrs
douglas
said
could
be
just
seventeen
syllables
long
no
more
no
less
it
usually
concentrated
on
one
clear
image
which
was
linked
to
one
specific
emotion
sadness
joy
nostalgia
happiness
love
ben
had
been
utterly
charmed
by
the
concept
he
enjoyed
his
english
classes
although
mild
enjoyment
was
generally
as
far
as
it
went
he
could
do
the
work
but
as
a
rule
there
was
nothing
in
it
which
gripped
him
yet
there
was
something
in
the
concept
of
haiku
that
fired
his
imagination
the
idea
made
him
feel
happy
the
way
mrs
starrett
explanation
of
the
greenhouse
effect
had
made
him
happy
haiku
was
good
poetry
ben
felt
because
it
was
structured
poetry
there
were
no
secret
rules
seventeen
syllables
one
image
linked
to
one
emotion
and
you
were
out
bingo
it
was
clean
it
was
utilitarian
it
was
entirely
contained
within
and
dependent
upon
its
own
rules
he
even
liked
the
word
itself
a
slide
of
air
broken
as
if
along
a
dotted
line
by
the
ksound
at
the
very
back
of
your
mouth
haiku
her
hair
he
thought
and
saw
her
going
down
the
school
steps
again
with
it
bouncing
on
her
shoulders
the
sun
did
notso
much
glint
on
it
as
seem
to
burn
within
it
working
carefully
over
a
twentyminute
period
with
one
break
to
go
back
and
get
more
workslips
striking
out
words
that
were
too
long
changing
deleting
ben
came
up
with
this
your
hair
is
winter
fire
january
embers
my
heart
bums
there
too
he
wasn't
crazy
about
it
but
it
was
the
best
he
could
do
he
was
afraid
that
if
he
fngged
around
with
it
too
long
worried
it
too
much
he
would
end
up
getting
the
jitters
and
doing
something
much
worse
or
wt
doing
it
at
all
he
didn’t
want
that
to
happen
the
moment
she
had
taken
to
speak
to
him
had
been
a
striking
moment
for
ben
he
wanted
to
mark
it
in
his
memory
probably
beverley
had
a
crush
on
some
bigger
boy
a
sixth
or
maybe
even
a
seventhgrader
and
she
would
think
that
maybe
that
boy
had
sent
the
haiku
that
would
make
her
happy
and
so
the
day
she
got
it
would
be
marked
in
her
memory
and
although
she
would
never
know
it
had
been
ben
hanscom
who
marked
it
for
her
that
was
all
right
he
would
know
he
copied
his
completed
poem
onto
the
back
of
the
postcard
printing

as
if
copying
out
a
ransom
note
rather
than
a
love
poem
clipped
his
pen
back
into
his
pocket
and
stuck
the
card
in
the
back
of
hot
rod
he
got
up
then
and
said
goodbye
to
mrs
starrett
on
his
way
out
goodbye
ben
mrs
starrett
said
enjoy
your
summer
vacation
but
don't
forget
about
the
curfew
won't
he
strolled
through
the
glassedin
passageway
between
the
two
buildings
enjoying
the
heat
there
greenhouse
effect
he
thought
smugly
followed
by
the
cool
of
the
adult
library
an
old
man
was
reading
the
news
in
one
of
the
ancient
comfortably
overstuffed
chairs
in
the
reading
room
alcove
the
headline
just
below
the
masthead
blazed
dulles
pledges
us
troops
to
help
lebanon
if
needed
there
was
also
a
photo
of
ike
shaking
hands
with
an
arab
in
the
rose
garden
ben
mamma
said
that
when
the
country
elected
hubert
humphrey
president
in
maybe
things
would
get
moving
again
ben
was
vaguely
aware
that
there
was
something
called
a
recession
going
on
and
his
mamma
was
afraid
she
might
get
laid
off
a
smaller
headline
on
the
bottom
half
of
page
one
read
police
hunt
for
psychopath
goes
on
ben
pushed
open
the
library
big
front
door
and
stepped
out
there
was
a
mailbox
at
the
foot
of
the
walk
ben
fished
the
postcard
from
the
back
of
the
book
and
mailed
it
he
felt
his
heartbeat
speed
up
a
little
as
it
slipped
out
of
his
fingers
what
if
she
knows
it
me
somehow
don't
be
a
stupe
he
responded
a
little
alarmed
at
how
exciting
that
idea
seemed
to
him
he
walked
off
up
kansas
street
hardly
aware
of
where
he
was
going
and
not
caring
at
all
a
fantasy
had
begun
to
form
in
his
mind
in
it
beverly
marsh
walked
up
to
him
her
gray
green
eyes
wide
her
auburn
hair
tied
back
in
a
ponytail
z
want
to
ask
you
a
question
ben
this
makebelieve
girl
said
in
his
mind
and
you've
got
to
swear
to
tell
the
truth
she
held
up
the
postcard
did
you
write
this
this
was
a
terrible
fantasy
this
was
a
wonderful
fantasy
he
wanted
it
to
stop
he
didn't
want
it
to
ever
stop
his
face
was
starting
to
burn
again
ben
walked
and
dreamed
and
shifted
his
library
books
from
one
arm
to
the
other
and
began
to
whistle
you'll
probably
think
i'm
horrible
beverly
said
but
i
think
i
want
to
kiss
you
her
lips
parted
slightly
ben
own
lips
were
suddenly
too
dry
to
whistle
think
i
want
you
to
he
whispered
and
smiled
a
dopey
dizzy
and
absolutely
beautiful
grin
if
he
had
looked
down
at
the
sidewalk
just
then
he
would
have
seen
that
three
other
shadows
had
grown
around
his
own
if
he
had
been
listening
he
would
have
heard
the
sound
of
victor
cleats
as
he
belch
and
henry
closed
in
but
he
neither
heard
nor
saw
ben
was
far
away
feeling
beverly
lips
slip
softly
against
his
mouth
raising
his
timid
hands
to
touch
the
dim
irish
fire
of
her
hair
like
many
cities
small
and
large
derry
had
not
been
planned
like
topsy
it
just
growed
city
planners
never
would
have
located
it
where
it
was
in
the
first
place
downtown
derry
was
in
a
valley
formed
by
the
kenduskeag
stream
which
ran
through
the
business
district
on
a
diagonal
from
southwest
to
northeast
the
rest
of
the
town
had
swarmed
up
the
sides
of
the
surrounding
hills
the
valley
the
township
original
settlers
came
to
had
been
swampy
and
heavily
grown
over
the
stream
and
the
penobscot
river
into
which
the
kenduskeag
emptied
were
great
things
for
traders
bad
ones
for
those
who
sowed
crops
or
built
their
houses
too
close
to
them
the
kenduskeag
in
particular
because
it
flooded
every
three
or
four
years
the
city
was
still
prone
to
flooding
in
spite
of
the
vast
amounts
of
money
spent
over
the
last
fifty
years
to
control
the
problem
if
the
floods
had
been
qused
only
by
the
stream
itself
a
system
of
dams
might
have
taken
care
of
things
there
were
however
other
factors
the
kenduskeag
low
banks
were
one
the
entire
area
logy
drainage
was
another
since
the
turn
of
the
century
there
had
been
many
serious
floods
in
derry
and
one
disastrous
one
in
to
make
matters
worse
the
hills
on
which
much
of
derry
was
built
were
honeycombed
with
small
streams
torrault
stream
in
which
the
body
of
cheryl
lamonica
had
been
found
was
one
of
them
during
periods
of
heavy
rain
they
were
all
apt
to
overflow
their
banks
if
it
rains
two
weeks
the
whole
damn
town
gets
a
sinus
infection
stuttering
bill
dad
had
said
once
the
kenduskeag
was
caged
in
a
concrete
canal
two
miles
long
as
it
passed
through
downtown
this
canal
dived
under
main
street
at
the
intersection
of
main
and
canal
becoming
an
underground
river
for
half
a
mile
or
so
before
surfacing
again
at
bassey
park
canal
street
where
most
of
derry
bars
were
ranked
like
felons
in
a
police
lineup
paralleled
the
canal
on
its
way
out
of
town
and
every
few
weeks
or
so
the
police
would
have
to
fish
some
drunk
car
out
of
the
water
which
was
polluted
to
dropdead
levels
by
sewage
and
mill
wastes
fish
were
caught
from
time
to
time
in
the
canal
but
they
were
inedible
mutants
on
the
northeastern
side
of
town
the
canal
side
the
river
had
been
managed
to
at
least
some
degree
a
thriving
commerce
went
on
all
along
it
in
spite
of
the
occasional
flooding
people
walked
beside
the
canal
sometimes
hand
in
hand
if
the
wind
was
right
that
was
if
it
was
wrong
the
stench
took
much
of
the
romance
out
of
such
strolling
and
at
bassey
park
which
faced
the
high
school
across
the
canal
there
were
sometimes
boy
scout
campouts
and
cub
scout
wiener
roasts
in
the
citizens
would
be
shocked
and
sickened
to
discover
that
hippies
one
of
them
had
actually
sewed
an
american
flag
on
the
seat
of
his
pants
and
that
pinkofaggot
was
busted
before
you
could
say
gene
mccarthy
were
smoking
dope
and
trading
pills
up
there
by
bassey
park
had
become
a
regular
openair
pharmacy
you
just
wait
people
said
somebody'll
get
killed
before
they
put
a
stop
to
it
and
of
course
someone
finally
did
a
seventeenyearold
boy
had
been
found
dead
by
the
canal
his
veins
full
of
almost
pure
heroin
what
the
kids
called
a
tight
white
rail
after
that
the
druggies
began
to
drift
away
from
bassey
park
and
there
were
even
stories
that
the
kid
ghost
was
haunting
the
area
the
story
was
stupid
of
course
but
if
it
kept
the
speedfreaks
and
the
nodders
away
it
was
at
least
a
useful
stupid
story
on
the
southwestern
side
of
town
the
river
presented
even
more
of
a
problem
here
the
hills
had
been
deeply
cut
open
by
the
passing
of
the
great
glacier
and
further
wounded
by
the
endless
water
erosion
of
the
kenduskeag
and
its
webwork
of
tributaries
the
bedrock
showed
through
in
many
places
like
the
halfunearthed
bones
of
dinosaurs
veteran
employees
of
the
derry
public
works
department
knew
that
following
the
fall
first
hard
frost
they
could
count
on
a
good
deal
of
sidewalk
repair
on
the
southwestern
side
of
town
the
concrete
would
contract
and
grow
brittle
and
then
the
bedrock
would
suddenly
shatter
up
through
it
as
if
the
earth
meant
to
hatch
something
what
grew
best
in
the
shallow
soil
which
remained
was
plants
with
shallow
rootsystems
and
hardy
natures
weeds
and
trashplants
in
other
words
scruffy
trees
thick
low
bushes
and
virulent
infestations
of
poison
ivy
and
poison
oak
grew
everywhere
they
were
allowed
a
foothold
the
southwest
was
where
the
land
fell
away
steeply
to
the
area
that
was
known
in
derry
as
the
barrens
the
barrens
which
were
anything
but
barren
were
a
messy
tract
of
land
about
a
mile
and
a
half
wide
by
three
miles
long
it
was
bounded
by
upper
kansas
street
on
one
side
and
by
old
cape
on
the
other
old
cape
was
a
lowincome
housing
development
and
the
drainage
was
so
bad
over
there
that
there
were
stories
of
toilets
and
sewer
pipes
actually
exploding
the
kenduskeag
ran
through
the
center
of
the
barrens
the
city
had
grown
up
to
the
northeast
and
on
both
sides
of
it
but
the
only
vestiges
of
the
city
down
there
were
derry
pumphouse
#
the
municipal
sewagepumping
station
and
the
city
dump
seen
from
the
air
the
barrens
looked
like
a
big
green
dagger
pointing
at
downtown
to
ben
all
this
geography
mated
with
geology
meant
was
a
vague
awareness
that
there
were
no
more
houses
on
his
right
side
now
the
land
had
dropped
away
a
rickety
whitewashed
railing
about
waisthigh
ran
beside
the
sidewalk
a
token
gesture
of
protection
he
could
faintly
hear
running
water
it
was
the
soundtrack
to
his
continuing
fantasy
he
paused
and
looked
out
over
the
barrens
still
imagining
her
eyes
the
clean
smell
of
her
hair
from
here
the
kenduskeag
was
only
a
series
of
twinkles
seen
through
breaks
in
the
thick
foliage
some
kids
said
that
there
were
mosquitoes
as
big
as
sparrows
down
there
at
this
time
of
year
others
said
there
was
quicksand
as
you
approached
the
river
ben
didn't
believe
about
the
mosquitoes
but
the
idea
of
quicksand
scared
him
slightly
to
his
left
he
could
see
a
cloud
of
circling
diving
seagulls
the
dump
their
cries
reached
him
faintly
across
the
way
he
could
see
derry
heights
and
the
low
roofs
of
the
old
cape
houses
closest
to
the
barrens
to
the
right
of
old
cape
pointing
skyward
like
a
squat
white
finger
was
the
derry
standpipe
directly
below
him
a
rusty
culvert
stuck
out
of
the
earth
spilling
discolored
water
down
the
hill
in
a
glimmering
little
stream
which
disappeared
into
the
tangled
trees
and
bushes
ben
pleasant
fantasy
of
beverly
was
suddenly
broken
by
one
far
more
grim
what
if
a
dead
hand
flopped
out
of
that
culvert
right
now
right
this
second
while
he
was
looking
and
suppose
that
when
he
turned
to
find
a
phone
and
call
the
police
a
clown
was
standing
there
a
funny
clown
wearing
a
baggy
suit
with
big
orange
puffs
for
buttons
suppose
a
hand
fell
on
ben
shoulder
and
he
screamed
there
was
laughter
he
whirled
around
shrinking
against
the
white
fence
separating
the
safe
sane
sidewalk
of
kansas
street
from
the
wildly
undisciplined
barrens
the
railing
creaked
audibly
and
saw
henry
bowers
belch
huggins
and
victor
criss
standing
there
hi
tits
henry
said
what
do
you
want
ben
asked
trying
to
sound
brave
i
want
to
beat
you
up
henry
said
he
seemed
to
contemplate
this
prospect
soberly
even
gravely
but
oh
his
black
eyes
sparkled
i
got
to
teach
you
something
tits
you
won't
mind
you
like
to
leam
new
things
don'tcha
he
reached
for
ben
ben
ducked
away
hold
him
you
guys
belch
and
victor
seized
his
arms
ben
squealed
it
was
a
cowardly
sound
rabbity
and
weak
but
he
couldn't
help
it
please
god
don't
let
them
make
me
cry
and
don't
let
them
break
my
watch
ben
thought
wildly
he
didn't
know
if
they
would
get
around
to
breaking
his
watch
or
not
but
he
was
pretty
sure
he
would
cry
he
was
pretty
sure
he
would
cry
plenty
before
they
were
through
with
him
jeezum
he
sounds
just
like
a
pig
victor
said
he
twisted
ben
wrist
don't
he
sound
like
a
pig
he
sure
do
belch
giggled
ben
lunged
first
one
way
and
then
the
other
belch
and
victor
went
with
him
easily
letting
him
lunge
then
yanking
him
back
henry
grabbed
the
front
of
ben
sweatshirt
and
yanked
it
upward
exposing
his
belly
it
hung
over
his
belt
in
a
swollen
droop
lookit
that
gu
henry
cried
in
amazed
disgust
jesuspleaseu
victor
and
belch
laughed
some
more
ben
looked
around
wildly
for
help
he
could
see
no
one
behind
him
down
in
the
barrens
crickets
drowsed
and
seagulls
screamed
you
just
better
quit
he
said
he
wasn't
blubbering
yet
but
was
close
to
it
you
just
better
or
what
henry
asked
as
if
he
was
honestly
interested
or
what
tits
or
what
huh
ben
suddenly
found
himself
thinking
of
broderick
crawford
who
played
dan
matthews
on
highway
patrol
that
bastard
was
tough
that
bastard
was
mean
that
bastard
took
zero
shit
from
anybody
and
then
he
burst
into
tears
dan
matthews
would
have
belted
these
guys
right
through
the
fence
down
the
embankment
and
into
the
puckerbrush
he
would
have
done
it
with
his
belly
oh
boy
lookit
the
baby
victor
chortled
belch
joined
in
henry
smiled
a
little
wt
his
face
still
held
that
grave
reflective
cast
that
look
that
was
somehow
almost
sad
it
frightened
ben
it
suggested
he
might
be
in
for
more
than
just
a
beating
as
if
to
confirm
this
idea
henry
reached
into
his
jeans
pocket
and
brought
out
a
bick
knife
ben
terror
exploded
he
had
been
whipsawing
his
body
futilely
to
either
side
now
he
suddenly
lunged
straight
forward
there
was
an
instant
when
he
believed
he
was
going
to
get
away
he
was
sweating
heavily
and
the
boys
holding
his
arms
lad
greasy
grips
at
best
belch
managed
to
hold
on
to
his
right
wrist
but
just
barely
he
pulled
entirely
free
of
victor
another
lunge
before
he
could
make
it
henry
stepped
forward
and
gave
him
a
shove
ben
flew
backward
the
railing
creaked
more
loudly
this
tune
and
he
felt
it
give
a
little
under
his
weight
belch
and
victor
grabbed
him
again
now
you
hold
hi
henry
said
you
hear
m
sure
henry
belch
said
he
sounded
a
trifle
uneasy
he
ain't
gonna
get
away
don't
worry
henry
stepped
forward
until
his
flat
stomach
almost
touched
ben
belly
ben
stared
at
him
tears
spilling
helplessly
out
of
his
wide
eyes
caught
i'm
caught
a
part
of
his
mind
yammered
he
tried
to
stop
it
he
couldn't
think
at
all
with
that
yammering
ging
on
but
it
wouldn't
stop
caught
caught
caught
henry
pulled
out
the
blade
which
was
long
and
wide
and
engraved
with
his
name
the
tip
glittered
in
the
afternoon
sunshine
tii
gonna
test
you
now
henry
said
in
that
same
reflective
voice
it
exam
time
tits
and
you
better
be
ready
ben
wept
his
heart
thundered
madly
in
his
chest
snot
ran
out
of
his
nose
and
collected
on
his
upper
lip
his
library
books
lay
in
a
scatter
at
his
feet
henry
stepped
on
bulldozer
glanced
down
and
dealt
it
into
the
gutter
with
a
sideswipe
of
one
black
engineer
boot
here
the
first
question
on
your
exam
tits
when
somebody
says
let
me
copy
during
finals
what
are
you
going
to
say
yes
ben
exclaimed
immediately
i'm
going
to
say
yes
sure
okay
copy
all
you
want
the
buck
tip
slid
through
two
inches
of
air
and
pressed
against
ben
stomach
it
was
as
cold
as
an
icecube
tray
just
out
of
the
frigidaire
ben
gasped
his
belly
away
from
it
for
a
moment
the
world
went
gray
henrys
mouth
was
moving
but
ben
couldn't
tell
what
he
was
saying
henry
was
like
a
tv
with
the
sound
turned
off
and
the
world
was
swimming
swimming
don't
you
dare
faint
the
panicky
voice
shrieked
if
you
faint
he
may
get
mad
enough
to
kill
you
the
world
came
back
into
some
kind
of
focus
he
saw
that
both
belch
and
victor
had
stopped
laughing
they
looked
nervous
almost
scared
seeing
that
had
the
effect
of
a
headclearing
slap
on
ben
all
of
a
sudden
they
don't
know
what
he
going
to
do
or
how
far
he
might
go
however
bad
you
thought
things
were
that
how
bad
they
really
are
maybe
even
a
little
worse
you
got
to
think
if
you
never
did
before
or
never
do
again
you
better
think
now
because
his
eyes
say
they're
right
to
look
nervous
his
eyes
say
he
crazy
as
a
bedbug
that
the
wrong
answer
tit
henry
said
if
just
anyone
says
let
me
copy
i
don't
give
a
red
fuck
what
you
do
got
i
ye
ben
said
his
belly
hitching
with
sobs
yes
i
got
it
well
okay
that
one
wrong
but
the
biggies
are
still
coming
up
you
ready
for
the
biggies
tt
i
guess
so
a
car
came
slowly
toward
them
it
was
a
dusty
ford
with
an
old
man
and
woman
propped
up
in
the
front
seat
like
a
pair
of
neglected
department
store
mannequins
ben
saw
the
old
man
head
turn
slowly
toward
him
henry
stepped
closer
to
ben
hiding
the
knife
ben
could
feel
its
point
dimpling
his
flesh
just
above
his
bellybutton
it
was
still
cold
he
didn't
see
how
that
could
be
but
was
go
ahead
yell
henry
said
you'll
be
pickin
your
fuckin
guts
off
your
sneakers
they
were
close
enough
to
kiss
ben
could
smell
the
sweet
smell
of
juicy
fruit
gum
on
henry
breath
the
car
passed
and
continued
on
down
kansas
street
as
slow
and
serene
as
the
pace
car
in
the
tournament
of
roses
parade
all
right
tits
here
the
second
question
if
z
say
let
me
copy
during
finals
what
are
you
going
to
say
yes
i'll
say
yes
right
away
henry
smiled
that
good
you
got
that
one
right
tits
now
here
the
third
question
how
am
i
going
to
be
sure
you
never
forget
that
tt
i
don't
know
ben
whispered
henry
smiled
his
face
lit
up
and
was
for
a
moment
almost
handsome
i
know
he
said
as
if
he
had
discovered
a
great
truth
i
know
tits
i'll
carve
my
name
on
your
big
fat
gu
victor
and
belch
abruptly
began
laughing
again
for
a
moment
ben
felt
a
species
of
bewildered
relief
thinking
it
had
all
been
nothing
but
makebelieve
a
little
shuckandjive
the
three
of
them
had
whomped
up
to
scare
the
living
hell
out
of
him
but
henry
bowers
wasn't
laughing
and
ben
suddenly
understood
that
victor
and
belch
were
laughing
because
they
were
relieved
it
was
obvious
to
both
of
them
that
henry
couldn't
be
serious
except
henry
was
the
buck
knife
slid
upward
smooth
as
butter
blood
welled
in
a
bright
red
line
on
ben
pallid
skin
hey
victor
cried
the
word
came
out
muffled
in
a
startled
gulp
hold
him
henry
snarled
you
just
hold
him
hear
me
now
there
was
nothing
grave
and
reflective
on
henry
face
now
it
was
the
twisted
face
of
a
devil
jeezwmcrow
henry
don't
really
cut
i
belch
screamed
and
his
voice
was
high
almost
a
girl
voice
everything
happened
fast
then
but
to
ben
hanscom
it
all
seemed
slow
it
all
seemed
to
happen
in
a
series
of
shutterclicks
like
action
stills
in
a
lifemagazine
photoessay
his
panic
was
gone
he
had
discovered
something
inside
him
suddenly
and
because
it
had
no
use
for
panic
that
something
just
ate
the
panic
whole
in
the
first
shutterclick
henry
had
snatched
his
sweatshirt
all
the
way
up
to
his
nipples
blood
was
pouring
from
the
shallow
vertical
cut
above
his
bellybutton
in
the
second
shutterclick
henry
drew
the
knife
down
again
operating
fast
like
a
lunatic
battle
surgeon
under
an
aerial
bombardment
fresh
blood
sowed
backward
ben
thought
coldly
as
blood
flowed
down
and
pooled
between
the
waistband
of
his
jeans
and
his
skin
got
to
go
backward
that
the
only
direction
i
can
get
away
in
belch
and
victor
weren't
holding
him
anymore
in
spite
of
henry
command
they
had
drawn
away
they
had
drawn
away
in
horror
but
if
he
ran
bowers
would
catch
him
in
the
third
shutterclick
henry
connected
the
two
vertical
slashes
with
a
short
horizontal
line
ben
could
feel
blood
running
into
his
underpants
now
and
a
sticky
snailtrail
was
creeping
down
his
left
thigh
henry
leaned
back
momentarily
frowning
with
the
studied
concentration
of
an
artist
painting
a
landscape
after
comes
e
ben
thought
and
that
was
all
it
took
to
get
him
moving
he
pulled
forward
a
little
bit
and
henry
shoved
him
back
again
ben
pushed
with
his
legs
adding
his
own
force
to
henry
he
hit
the
whitewashed
railing
between
kansas
street
and
the
drop
into
the
barrens
as
he
did
he
raised
his
right
foot
and
planted
it
in
henry
belly
this
was
not
a
retaliatory
act
ben
only
wanted
to
increase
his
backward
force
and
yet
when
he
saw
the
expression
of
utter
surprise
on
henry
face
he
was
filled
with
a
clear
savage
joy
a
feeling
so
intense
that
for
a
split
second
he
thought
the
top
of
his
head
was
going
to
come
off
then
there
was
a
cracking
splintering
sound
from
the
railing
ben
saw
victor
and
belch
catch
henry
before
he
could
fall
on
his
ass
in
the
gutter
next
to
the
remains
of
bulldozer
and
then
ben
was
falling
backward
into
space
he
went
with
a
scream
that
was
half
a
laugh
ben
hit
the
slope
on
his
back
and
buttocks
just
below
the
culvert
he
had
spotted
earlier
it
was
a
god
thing
he
landed
below
it
if
he
had
landed
on
it
he
might
well
have
broken
his
back
as
it
was
he
landed
on
a
thick
cushion
of
weeds
and
bracken
and
barely
felt
the
impact
he
did
a
backward
somersault
feet
and
legs
snapping
over
his
head
he
landed
sitting
up
and
went
sliding
down
the
slope
backward
like
a
kid
on
a
big
green
chutethe
chute
his
sweatshirt
pulled
up
around
his
neck
his
hands
grabbing
for
purchase
and
doing
nothing
but
yanking
out
tuft
after
tuft
of
bracken
and
witchgrass
he
saw
the
top
of
the
embankment
it
seemed
impossible
that
he
had
just
been
standing
up
there
receding
with
crazy
cartoon
speed
he
saw
victor
and
belch
their
faces
round
white
o
staring
down
at
him
he
had
time
to
mourn
his
library
books
then
he
fetched
up
against
something
with
agonizing
force
and
nearly
bit
his
tongue
in
half
it
was
a
downed
tree
and
it
checked
ben
fall
by
nearly
breaking
his
left
leg
he
clawed
his
way
back
up
the
slope
a
little
bit
pulling
his
leg
free
with
a
groan
the
tree
had
stopped
him
about
halfway
down
below
the
bushes
were
thicker
water
falling
from
the
culvert
ran
over
his
hands
in
thin
streams
there
was
a
shriek
from
above
him
ben
looked
up
again
and
saw
henry
bowers
come
flying
over
the
drop
his
knife
clenched
between
his
teeth
he
landed
on
both
feet
body
thrown
backward
at
a
steep
angle
so
he
would
not
overbalance
he
skidded
to
the
end
of
a
gigantic
set
of
footprints
and
then
began
to
run
down
the
embankment
in
a
series
of
gangling
kangaroo
leaps
tn
goin
oo
kill
ooo
its
henry
was
shrieking
around
the
knife
and
ben
didn't
need
a
un
translator
to
tell
him
henry
was
saying
i'm
going
to
kill
you
tits
t'n
gain
oo
huckin
kill
ooo
now
with
that
cold
general
eye
he
had
discovered
up
above
on
the
sidewalk
ben
saw
what
he
had
to
do
he
managed
to
gain
his
feet
just
before
henry
arrived
the
knife
now
in
his
hand
and
held
straight
out
in
front
of
him
like
a
bayonet
ben
was
peripherally
aware
that
the
left
leg
of
his
jeans
was
shredded
and
his
leg
was
bleeding
much
more
heavily
than
his
stomach
but
it
was
supporting
him
and
that
meant
it
wasn't
broken
at
least
he
hoped
that
what
it
meant
ben
crouched
slightly
to
maintain
his
precarious
balance
and
as
henry
grabbed
at
him
with
one
hand
and
swept
the
knife
in
a
long
flat
arc
with
the
other
ben
stepped
aside
he
lost
his
balance
but
as
he
fell
down
he
stuck
out
his
shredded
left
leg
henry
shins
struck
it
and
his
legs
were
booted
out
from
under
him
with
great
efficiency
for
a
moment
ben
gaped
his
terror
overcome
with
a
mixture
of
awe
and
admiration
henry
bowers
appeared
to
be
flying
exactly
like
superman
over
the
fallen
tree
where
ben
had
stopped
his
arms
were
straight
out
in
front
of
him
the
way
george
reeves
held
his
arms
out
on
the
tv
show
only
george
reeves
always
looked
like
flying
was
as
natural
as
taking
a
bath
or
eating
lunch
on
the
back
porch
henry
looked
like
someone
had
shoved
a
hot
poker
up
his
ass
his
mouth
was
opening
and
closing
a
string
of
saliva
was
shooting
back
from
one
corner
of
it
and
as
ben
watched
it
splatted
against
the
lobe
of
henry
ear
then
henry
crashed
back
to
earth
the
knife
flew
out
of
his
hand
he
rolled
over
on
one
shoulder
landed
on
his
back
and
slid
away
into
the
bushes
with
his
legs
splayed
into
a
v
there
was
a
yell
a
thud
and
then
silence
ben
sat
dazed
looking
at
the
matted
place
in
the
bushes
where
henry
had
done
his
disappearing
act
suddenly
rocks
and
pebbles
began
to
bounce
by
him
he
looked
up
again
victor
and
belch
were
now
descending
the
embankment
they
were
moving
more
carefully
than
henry
and
hence
more
slowly
but
they
would
reach
him
in
thirty
seconds
or
less
if
he
didn't
do
something
he
moaned
would
this
lunacy
never
end
keeping
his
eye
on
them
he
clambered
over
the
downed
tree
and
began
to
scramble
down
the
embankment
panting
harshly
he
had
a
stitch
in
his
side
his
tongue
hurt
like
hell
the
bushes
were
no
w
almost
as
tall
as
ben
himself
the
randy
green
smell
of
stuff
growing
out
of
control
filled
his
nose
he
could
hear
running
water
somewhere
close
chuckling
over
stones
and
rilling
between
them
his
feet
slipped
and
here
he
went
again
rolling
and
sliding
smashing
the
back
of
his
hand
against
a
jutting
rock
shooting
through
a
patch
of
thorns
that
hooked
bluegray
puffs
of
cotton
from
his
sweatshirt
and
little
divots
of
meat
from
his
hands
and
cheeks
he
slammed
to
a
jarring
halt
sitting
up
with
his
feet
in
the
water
here
was
a
little
curving
stream
which
wound
its
way
into
a
thick
stand
of
second
growth
trees
to
his
right
it
looked
as
dark
as
a
cave
in
there
he
looked
to
his
left
and
saw
henry
bowers
lying
on
his
back
in
the
middle
of
the
stream
his
halfopen
eyes
showed
only
whites
blood
trickled
from
one
ear
and
ran
toward
ben
in
delicate
threads
oh
my
god
i
killed
him
oh
my
god
i'm
a
murderer
oh
my
god
forgetting
that
belch
and
victor
were
behind
him
or
perhaps
understanding
they
would
lose
all
interest
in
beating
the
shit
out
of
him
when
they
discovered
their
fearless
leader
was
dead
ben
splashed
twenty
feet
upstream
to
where
henry
lay
his
shirt
in
ribbons
his
jeans
soaked
black
one
shoe
gone
ben
was
vaguely
aware
that
there
was
precious
little
left
of
his
own
clothes
and
that
his
body
was
one
big
rattletrap
of
aches
and
pains
his
left
ankle
was
the
worst
it
had
already
puffed
tight
against
his
soaking
sneaker
and
he
was
favoring
it
so
badly
that
he
was
really
not
walking
but
lurching
like
a
sailor
on
shore
for
the
first
time
after
a
long
sea
voyage
he
bent
over
henry
bowers
henry
eyes
popped
wide
open
he
grabbed
ben
calf
with
one
scraped
and
bloody
hand
his
mouth
worked
and
although
nothing
but
a
series
of
whistling
aspirations
emerged
ben
could
still
make
out
what
he
was
saying
kill
you
you
fat
shit
henry
was
trying
to
pull
himself
up
using
ben
leg
as
a
pole
ben
pulled
backward
frantically
henry
hand
slipped
down
then
off
ben
flew
backward
whirling
his
arms
and
fell
on
his
ass
for
a
recordbreaking
third
time
in
the
last
four
minutes
he
also
bit
his
tongue
again
water
splashed
up
around
him
a
rainbow
glimmered
for
an
instant
in
front
of
ben
eyes
ben
didn't
give
a
fuck
about
the
rainbow
he
didn't
give
a
fuck
about
finding
a
pot
of
gold
he
would
settle
for
his
miserable
fat
life
henry
rolled
over
tried
to
stand
fell
back
managed
to
get
to
his
hands
and
knees
and
finally
tottered
to
his
feet
he
stared
at
ben
with
those
black
eyes
the
front
of
his
flattop
now
leaned
this
way
and
that
like
cornhusks
after
a
high
wind
has
passed
through
ben
was
suddenly
angry
no
this
was
more
than
being
angry
he
was
infuriated
he
had
been
walking
with
his
library
books
under
his
arm
having
an
innocent
little
daydream
about
kissing
beverly
marsh
bothering
nobody
and
look
at
this
just
look
pants
shredded
left
ankle
maybe
broken
badly
sprained
for
sure
leg
all
cut
up
tongue
all
cut
up
henry
goddam
bowers
monogram
on
his
stomach
how
about
all
that
happy
crappy
sports
fans
but
it
was
probably
the
thought
of
his
library
books
for
which
he
was
liable
that
drove
him
to
charge
henry
bowers
his
lost
library
books
and
his
mental
image
of
how
reproachful
mrs
starrett
eyes
would
become
when
he
told
her
whatever
the
reason
cuts
sprain
library
books
or
even
the
thought
of
the
soggy
and
probably
illegible
rankcard
in
his
back
pocket
it
was
enough
to
get
him
moving
he
lumbered
forward
squashy
keds
spatting
in
the
shallow
water
and
kicked
henry
squarely
in
the
balls
henry
uttered
a
horrid
rusty
scream
that
sent
birds
beating
up
from
the
trees
he
stood
spraddlelegged
for
a
moment
hands
clasping
his
crotch
staring
unbelievingly
at
ben
u
he
said
in
a
small
voice
right
ben
said
u
henry
said
in
an
even
smaller
voice
right
ben
said
again
henry
sank
slowly
back
to
his
knees
not
so
much
falling
as
folding
up
he
was
still
looking
at
ben
with
those
unbelieving
black
eyes
us
damn
right
ben
said
henry
fell
on
his
side
still
clutching
his
testicles
and
began
to
roll
slowly
from
side
to
side
ug
henry
moaned
my
balls
ug
oh
you
broke
my
balls
ugu
he
was
now
beginning
to
gain
a
little
force
and
ben
started
to
back
away
a
step
at
a
time
he
was
sickened
by
what
he
had
done
but
he
was
also
filled
with
a
kind
of
righteous
paralyzed
fascination
ug/
my
fuckin
sack
ugug
oh
my
fuckin
balls
ben
might
have
remained
in
the
area
for
an
untold
length
of
time
perhaps
even
until
henry
recovered
enough
to
come
after
him
but
just
then
a
rock
struck
him
above
the
right
ear
with
such
a
deep
drilling
pain
that
until
he
felt
warm
blood
flowing
again
ben
thought
he
had
been
stung
by
a
wasp
he
turned
and
saw
the
other
two
striding
up
the
middle
of
the
stream
toward
him
they
each
had
a
handful
of
waterrounded
rocks
victor
pegged
one
and
ben
heard
it
whistle
past
his
ear
he
ducked
and
another
struck
his
right
knee
making
him
yell
with
surprised
hurt
a
third
bounced
off
his
right
cheekbone
and
that
eye
filled
with
water
he
scrambled
for
the
far
bank
and
climbed
it
as
fast
as
he
could
grabbing
onto
protruding
roots
and
hauling
on
handfuls
of
bushes
he
made
it
to
the
top
one
final
stone
struck
his
buttocks
as
he
pulled
himself
up
and
took
a
quick
look
back
over
his
shoulder
belch
was
kneeling
beside
henry
while
victor
stood
half
a
dozen
feet
away
firing
stones
one
the
size
of
a
baseball
clipped
through
the
mamhigh
bushes
beside
ben
he
had
seen
enough
in
fact
he
had
seen
much
more
than
enough
worst
of
all
henry
bowers
was
getting
up
again
like
ben
own
timex
watch
henry
could
take
a
licking
and
keep
on
ticking
ben
turned
and
smashed
his
way
into
the
bushes
lumbering
along
in
a
direction
he
hoped
was
west
if
he
could
cross
to
the
old
cape
side
of
the
barrens
he
could
beg
a
dime
off
somebody
and
take
the
bus
home
and
when
he
got
there
he
would
lock
the
door
behind
him
and
bury
these
tattered
bloody
clothes
in
the
trash
and
this
crazy
dream
would
finally
be
over
ben
thought
of
himself
sitting
in
his
chair
in
the
living
room
freshly
tubbed
wearing
his
fuzzy
red
bathrobe
watching
daffy
duck
cartoons
on
the
mighty
ninety
and
drinking
milk
through
a
strawberry
flavrstraw
hold
that
thought
he
told
himself
grimly
and
kept
lumbering
along
bushes
sprang
into
his
face
ben
pushed
them
aside
thorns
reached
and
clawed
he
tried
to
ignore
them
he
came
to
a
flat
area
of
ground
that
was
black
and
mucky
a
thick
stand
of
bamboolike
growth
spread
across
it
and
a
fetid
smell
rose
from
the
earth
an
ominous
thought
quicksand
slipped
across
the
foreground
of
his
mind
like
a
shadow
as
he
looked
at
the
sheen
of
standing
water
deeper
into
the
grove
of
bamboostuff
he
didn't
want
to
go
in
there
even
if
it
wasn't
quicksand
the
mud
would
suck
his
sneakers
off
he
turned
right
instead
running
along
the
front
of
the
bamboo
grove
and
finally
into
a
patch
of
real
woods
the
trees
mostly
firs
were
thick
growing
everywhere
battling
each
other
for
a
little
space
and
sun
but
there
was
less
undergrowth
and
he
could
move
faster
he
was
no
longer
sure
what
direction
he
was
moving
in
but
still
thought
he
was
on
measure
a
little
ahead
of
the
game
the
barrens
were
enclosed
by
derry
on
three
sides
and
bounded
by
the
half
finished
turnpike
extension
on
the
fourth
sooner
or
later
he
would
come
out
somewhere
his
stomach
throbbed
painfully
and
he
pulled
up
the
remains
of
his
sweatshirt
for
a
look
he
winced
and
drew
a
whistle
of
air
in
over
his
teeth
his
belly
looked
like
a
grotesque
christmastree
ball
all
caked
red
blood
and
smeared
green
from
his
slide
down
the
embankment
he
pulled
the
sweatshirt
down
again
looking
at
that
mess
made
him
feel
like
blowing
lunch
now
he
heard
a
low
humming
noise
from
ahead
it
was
one
steady
note
just
above
the
low
range
of
his
hearing
an
adult
intent
only
on
getting
the
hell
out
of
there
the
mosquitoes
had
found
ben
now
and
while
nowhere
near
as
big
as
sparrows
they
were
pretty
big
would
have
ignored
it
or
simply
not
heard
it
at
all
but
ben
was
a
boy
and
he
was
already
getting
over
his
fright
he
swerved
to
his
left
and
pushed
through
some
low
laurel
bushes
beyond
them
sticking
out
of
the
ground
were
the
top
three
feet
of
a
cement
cylinder
about
four
feet
wide
it
was
capped
with
a
vented
iron
manhole
cover
the
cover
was
stamped
with
the
words
derry
sewer
deft
the
sound
this
close
it
was
more
a
drone
than
a
hum
was
coming
from
someplace
deep
inside
ben
put
one
eye
to
a
venthole
but
could
see
nothing
he
could
hear
that
drone
and
water
running
down
there
someplace
but
that
was
all
he
took
a
breath
got
a
whiff
of
a
sour
smell
that
was
both
dank
and
shitty
and
drew
back
with
a
wince
it
was
a
sewer
that
was
all
or
maybe
a
combined
sewer
and
drainagetunnel
there
were
plenty
of
those
in
flood
conscious
derry
no
big
deal
but
it
had
given
him
a
funny
sort
of
chill
part
of
it
was
seeing
the
handiwork
of
man
in
all
this
overgrown
jumble
of
wilderness
but
he
supposed
part
of
it
was
the
shape
of
the
thing
itself
that
concrete
cylinder
jutting
out
of
the
ground
ben
had
read
g
wells
the
time
machine
the
year
before
first
the
classics
comics
version
and
then
the
whole
book
this
cylinder
with
its
vented
iron
cap
reminded
him
of
the
wells
which
lead
down
into
the
country
of
the
stumped
and
horrible
morlocks
he
moved
away
from
it
quickly
trying
to
find
west
again
he
got
to
a
link
clearing
and
turned
until
his
shadow
was
as
directly
behind
him
as
he
could
get
it
then
he
headed
off
in
a
straight
line
five
minutes
later
he
heard
more
running
water
ahead
and
voices
kid
voices
he
stopped
to
listen
and
that
was
when
he
heard
snapping
branches
and
other
voices
behind
him
they
were
perfectly
recognizable
they
belonged
to
victor
belch
and
the
one
and
only
henry
bowers
the
nightmare
was
not
over
yet
it
seemed
ben
looked
around
for
a
place
to
go
to
earth
he
came
out
of
his
hiding
place
about
two
hours
later
dirtier
than
ever
but
a
little
refreshed
incredible
as
it
seemed
to
him
he
had
dozed
off
when
he
had
heard
the
three
of
them
behind
him
coming
after
him
still
ben
had
come
dangerously
close
to
freezing
up
completely
like
an
animal
caught
in
the
headlamps
of
an
oncoming
truck
a
paralytic
drowsiness
began
to
steal
over
him
the
idea
of
simply
lying
down
curling
up
into
a
ball
like
a
hedgehog
and
letting
them
do
whatever
they
felt
they
had
to
occurred
to
him
it
was
a
crazy
idea
but
it
also
seemed
like
a
strangely
good
idea
but
instead
ben
began
to
move
toward
the
sound
of
the
runnng
water
and
those
other
kids
he
tried
to
untangle
their
voices
and
get
the
sense
of
what
they
were
saying
anything
to
shake
off
that
scary
paralysis
of
the
spirit
some
project
they
were
talking
about
some
project
one
or
two
of
the
voices
were
even
alittle
familiar
there
was
a
splash
followed
by
a
burst
of
goodnatured
laughter
the
laughter
filled
ben
with
a
kind
of
stupid
longing
and
made
him
more
aware
of
his
dangerous
position
than
anything
else
had
done
if
he
was
going
to
be
caught
there
was
no
need
to
let
these
kids
in
for
a
dose
of
his
medicine
ben
turned
nght
again
like
many
large
people
he
was
remarkably
light
footed
he
passed
close
enough
to
the
boys
to
see
their
shadows
moving
back
and
forth
between
him
and
the
bright
water
but
they
neither
saw
him
nor
heard
him
gradually
their
voices
began
to
fall
behind
he
came
to
a
narrow
path
which
had
been
beaten
down
to
the
bare
earth
ben
considered
it
for
a
moment
then
shook
his
head
a
little
he
crossed
it
and
plunged
into
the
undergrowth
again
he
moved
more
slowly
now
pushing
bushes
aside
rather
than
stampeding
through
them
he
was
still
moving
roughly
parallel
to
the
stream
the
other
kids
had
been
playing
beside
even
through
the
intervening
bushes
and
trees
he
could
see
it
was
much
wider
than
the
one
into
which
he
and
henry
had
fallen
here
was
another
of
those
concrete
cylinders
barely
visible
amid
a
snarl
of
blackberry
creepers
humming
quietly
to
itself
beyond
an
embankment
dropped
off
to
the
stream
and
here
an
ol
gnarled
elm
tree
leaned
crookedly
out
over
the
water
its
roots
halfexposed
by
bank
erosion
looked
like
a
snarl
of
dirty
hair
hoping
there
wouldn't
be
bugs
or
snakes
but
too
tired
and
numbly
frightened
to
really
care
ben
had
worked
his
way
between
the
roots
and
into
a
shallow
cave
beneath
he
leaned
back
a
root
jabbed
him
like
an
angry
finger
he
shifted
his
position
a
little
and
it
supported
him
quite
nicely
here
came
henry
belch
and
victor
he
had
thought
they
might
be
fooled
into
following
the
path
but
no
such
luck
they
stood
close
by
him
for
a
moment
any
closer
and
he
could
have
reached
out
of
his
hiding
place
and
touched
them
bet
them
little
snotholes
back
there
saw
hi
belch
said
well
let
go
find
out
henry
replied
and
they
headed
back
the
way
they
had
come
a
few
moments
later
ben
heard
him
roar
what
the
fuck
you
kids
doin
here
there
was
some
sort
of
reply
but
ben
couldn't
tell
what
it
was
the
kids
were
too
far
away
and
this
close
the
river
it
was
the
kenduskeag
of
course
was
too
loud
but
he
thought
the
kid
sounded
scared
ben
could
sympathize
then
victor
criss
bellowed
something
ben
hadn't
understood
at
all
what
a
fuckin
baby
da
baby
dam
baby
damn
or
maybe
victor
had
said
what
a
damn
bunch
of
babies
and
ben
had
misheard
him
let
break
it
belch
proposed
there
were
yells
of
protest
followed
by
a
scream
of
pain
someone
began
to
cry
yes
ben
could
sympathize
they
hadn't
been
able
to
catch
him
or
at
least
not
yet
but
here
was
another
bunch
of
little
kids
for
them
to
take
out
their
mad
on
sure
break
i
henry
said
splashes
yells
big
moronic
gusts
of
laughter
from
belch
and
victor
an
agonized
infuriated
cry
from
one
of
the
little
kids
don't
gimme
any
of
your
shit
you
stuttering
little
freak
henry
bowers
said
i
ain't
takin
no
more
shit
from
nobody
today
there
was
a
splintering
crack
the
sound
of
running
water
downstream
grew
louder
and
roared
briefly
before
quieting
to
its
former
placid
chuckle
ben
suddenly
understood
baby
dam
yes
that
was
what
victor
had
said
the
kids
two
or
three
of
them
it
had
sounded
like
when
he
passed
by
had
been
building
a
dam
henry
and
his
friends
had
just
kicked
it
apart
ben
even
thought
he
knew
who
one
of
the
kids
was
the
only
stuttering
little
freak
he
knew
from
derry
school
was
bill
denbrough
who
was
in
the
other
fifth
grade
classroom
you
didn't
have
to
do
that
a
thin
and
fearful
voice
cried
out
and
ben
recognized
that
voice
as
well
although
he
could
not
immediately
put
a
face
with
it
why
did
you
do
that
because
i
felt
like
it
fucknuts
henry
roared
back
there
was
a
meaty
thud
it
was
followed
by
a
scream
of
pain
the
scream
was
followed
by
weeping
shut
up
victor
said
shut
up
that
crying
kid
or
i'll
pull
your
ears
down
and
tie
em
under
your
chin
the
crying
became
a
series
of
choked
snuffles
we're
going
henry
said
but
before
we
do
i
want
to
know
one
thing
you
seen
a
fat
kid
in
the
last
ten
minutes
or
so
big
fat
kid
all
bloody
and
cut
up
there
was
a
reply
too
brief
to
be
anything
but
no
you
sure
belch
asked
you
better
be
mushmouth
iei'm
shshsur
bill
denbrough
replied
let
g
henry
said
he
probably
waded
acrost
back
that
way
tata
boys
victor
criss
called
it
was
a
real
baby
dam
believe
me
you're
better
off
without
it
splashing
sounds
belch
voice
came
again
but
farther
away
now
ben
couldn't
make
out
the
words
in
fact
he
didn't
want
to
make
out
the
words
closer
by
the
boy
who
had
been
crying
now
resumed
there
were
comforting
noises
from
the
other
boy
ben
had
decided
there
was
just
the
two
of
them
stuttering
bill
and
the
weeper
he
halfsat
halflay
where
he
was
listening
to
the
two
boys
by
the
river
and
the
fading
sounds
of
henry
and
his
dinosaur
friends
crashing
toward
the
far
side
of
the
barrens
sunlight
flicked
at
his
eyes
and
made
little
coins
of
light
on
the
tangled
roots
above
and
around
him
it
was
dirty
in
here
but
it
was
also
cozy
safe
the
sound
of
running
water
was
soothing
even
the
sound
of
the
crying
kid
was
sort
of
soothing
his
aches
and
pains
had
faded
to
a
dull
throb
and
the
sound
of
the
dinosaurs
had
faded
out
completely
he
would
wait
awhile
just
to
be
sure
they
weren't
coming
back
and
then
he
would
make
tracks
ben
could
hear
the
throb
of
the
drainage
machinery
coming
through
the
earth
could
even
feel
it
a
low
steady
vibration
that
went
from
the
ground
to
the
root
he
was
leaning
against
and
then
into
his
back
he
thought
of
the
morlocks
again
of
their
naked
flesh
he
imagined
it
would
smell
like
the
dank
and
shitty
air
that
had
come
up
through
the
ventholes
of
that
iron
cap
he
thought
of
their
wells
driven
deep
into
the
earth
wells
with
rusty
ladders
bolted
to
their
sides
he
dozed
and
at
some
point
his
thoughts
became
a
dream
it
wasn't
morlocks
he
dreamed
of
he
dreamed
of
the
thing
which
had
happened
to
him
in
january
the
thing
which
he
hadn't
quite
been
able
to
tell
his
mother
it
had
been
the
first
day
of
school
after
the
long
christmas
break
mrs
douglas
had
asked
for
a
volunteer
to
stay
after
and
help
her
count
the
books
that
had
been
turned
in
just
before
the
vacation
ben
had
raised
his
hand
thank
you
ben
mrs
douglas
had
said
favoring
him
with
a
smile
of
such
brilliance
that
it
warmed
him
down
to
his
toes
suckas
henry
bowers
remarked
under
his
breath
it
had
been
the
sort
of
maine
winter
day
that
is
both
the
best
and
the
worst
cloudless
eye
wateringly
bright
but
so
cold
it
was
a
little
frightening
to
make
the
tendegree
temperature
worse
there
was
a
strong
wind
to
give
the
cold
a
bitter
cutting
edge
ben
counted
books
and
called
out
numbers
mrs
douglas
wrote
them
down
not
bothering
to
double
check
his
work
even
on
a
random
basis
he
was
proud
to
note
and
then
they
both
carried
the
books
down
to
the
storage
room
through
halls
where
radiators
clanked
dreamily
at
first
the
school
had
been
full
of
sounds
slamming
locker
doors
the
clacketyclack
of
mrs
thomas
typewriter
in
the
office
the
slightly
offkey
choral
renditions
of
the
glee
club
upstairs
the
nervous
thudthudthud
of
basketballs
from
the
gym
and
the
scrooch
and
thud
of
sneakers
as
players
drove
toward
the
baskets
or
cut
turns
on
the
polished
wood
floor
little
by
little
these
sounds
ceased
until
as
the
last
set
of
books
was
totted
up
one
short
but
it
hardly
mattered
mrs
douglas
sighed
they
were
all
holding
together
on
a
wing
and
a
prayer
the
only
sounds
were
the
radiators
the
faint
whisshwhissh
of
mr
fazio
broom
as
he
pushed
colored
sawdust
up
the
hall
floor
and
the
howl
of
the
wind
outside
ben
looked
toward
the
book
room
one
narrow
window
and
saw
that
the
light
was
fading
rapidly
from
the
sky
it
was
four
o'clock
and
dusk
was
at
hand
membranes
of
dry
snow
blew
around
the
icy
jungle
gym
and
skirled
between
the
teetertotters
which
were
frozen
solidly
into
the
ground
only
the
thaws
of
april
would
break
those
bitter
winterwelds
he
saw
no
one
at
all
on
jackson
street
he
looked
a
moment
longer
expecting
a
car
to
roll
through
the
jackson
witcham
intersection
but
none
did
everyone
in
derry
save
himself
and
mrs
douglas
might
be
dead
or
fled
at
least
from
what
he
could
see
from
here
he
looked
toward
her
and
saw
with
a
touch
of
real
fright
that
she
was
feeling
almost
exactly
the
same
things
he
was
feeling
himself
he
could
tell
by
the
look
in
her
eyes
they
were
deep
and
thoughtful
and
far
off
not
the
eyes
of
a
schoolteacher
in
her
forties
but
those
of
a
child
her
hands
were
folded
just
below
her
breasts
as
if
in
prayer
i'm
scared
ben
thought
and
she
scared
too
but
what
are
we
realty
scared
of
he
didn't
know
then
she
looked
at
him
and
uttered
a
short
almost
embarrassed
laugh
tve
kept
you
too
late
she
said
t'm
sorry
ben
that
okay
he
looked
down
at
his
shoes
he
loved
her
a
little
not
with
the
frank
unquestioning
love
he
had
lavished
on
miss
thibodeau
his
firstgrade
teacher
but
he
did
love
her
if
i
drove
i'd
give
you
a
ride
she
said
but
i
don't
my
husband
going
to
pick
me
up
around
quarter
past
five
if
you'd
care
to
wait
we
could
no
thanks
ben
said
i
ought
to
get
home
before
then
this
was
not
really
the
truth
but
he
felt
a
queer
aversion
to
the
idea
of
meeting
mrs
douglas
husband
maybe
your
mother
could
she
doesn't
drive
either
ben
said
tii
be
all
right
it
only
a
mile
home
a
mile
not
far
when
it
nice
but
it
can
be
a
very
long
way
in
this
weather
you'll
go
in
somewhere
if
it
gets
too
cold
won't
you
ben
aw
sure
i'll
go
into
costello
market
and
stand
by
the
stove
a
little
while
or
something
mr
gedreau
doesn't
mind
and
i
got
my
snowpants
my
new
christmas
scarf
too
mrs
douglas
looked
a
little
reassured
and
then
she
glanced
toward
the
window
again
tt
just
looks
so
cold
out
ther
she
said
so
so
inimical
he
didn't
know
the
word
but
he
knew
exactly
what
she
meant
something
just
happened
what
he
had
seen
her
he
realized
suddenly
as
a
person
instead
of
just
a
teacher
that
was
what
had
happened
suddenly
he
had
seen
her
face
in
an
entirely
different
way
and
because
he
did
it
became
a
new
face
the
face
of
a
tired
poet
he
could
see
her
ging
home
with
her
husband
sitting
beside
him
in
the
car
with
her
hands
folded
as
the
heater
hissed
and
he
talked
about
his
day
he
could
see
her
making
them
dinner
an
odd
thought
crossed
his
mind
and
a
cocktailparty
question
rose
to
his
lips
do
you
have
children
mrs
douglas
i
often
think
at
this
time
of
the
year
that
people
really
weren't
meant
to
live
this
far
north
of
the
equator
she
said
at
least
not
in
this
latitude
then
she
smiled
and
some
of
the
strangeness
either
went
out
of
her
face
or
his
eye
he
was
able
to
see
her
at
least
partially
as
he
always
had
but
you'll
never
see
her
that
way
again
not
completely
he
thought
dismayed
til
feel
old
until
spring
and
then
i'll
feel
young
again
it
that
way
every
year
are
you
sure
you'll
be
all
right
ben
til
be
fine
yes
i
suppose
you
will
you're
a
good
boy
ben
he
looked
back
at
his
toes
blushing
loving
her
more
than
ever
in
the
hallway
mr
fazio
said
be
careful
of
de
fros'bite
bo
without
looking
up
from
his
red
sawdust
twill
he
reached
his
locker
opened
it
and
yanked
on
his
snowpants
he
had
been
painfully
unhappy
when
his
mother
insisted
he
wear
them
again
this
winter
on
especially
cold
days
thinking
of
them
as
baby
clothes
but
he
was
glad
to
have
them
this
afternoon
he
walked
slowly
toward
the
door
zipping
his
coat
yanking
the
drawstrings
of
his
hood
tight
pulling
on
his
mittens
he
went
out
and
stood
on
the
snowpacked
top
step
of
the
front
stairs
for
a
moment
listening
as
the
door
snicked
closed
and
locked
behind
him
derry
school
brooded
under
a
bruised
skin
of
sky
the
wind
blew
steadily
the
snap
hooks
on
the
flagpole
rope
rattled
a
lonesome
tattoo
against
the
steel
pole
itself
that
wind
cut
into
the
warm
and
unprepared
flesh
of
ben
face
at
once
numbing
his
cheeks
be
careful
of
de
fros'bite
boy
he
quickly
pulled
his
scarf
up
until
he
looked
like
a
small
pudgy
caricature
of
red
ryder
that
darkening
sky
had
a
fantastical
sort
of
beauty
but
ben
dd
not
pause
to
admire
it
it
was
too
cold
for
that
he
got
going
at
first
the
wind
was
at
his
back
and
things
didn't
seem
so
bad
in
fact
it
actually
seemed
to
be
helping
him
along
at
canal
street
however
he
had
to
turn
right
and
almost
fully
into
the
wind
now
it
seemed
to
be
holding
him
back
as
if
it
had
business
with
him
his
scarf
helped
a
little
but
not
enough
his
eyes
throbbed
and
the
moisture
in
his
nose
froze
to
a
crack
glaze
his
legs
were
going
numb
several
times
he
stuck
his
mittened
hands
into
his
armpits
to
warm
them
up
the
wind
whooped
and
screamed
sometimes
sounding
almost
human
ben
felt
both
frightened
and
exhilarated
frightened
because
he
could
now
understand
stories
he
had
read
such
as
jack
london
to
build
a
fire
where
people
actually
froze
to
death
it
would
be
all
too
possible
to
freeze
to
death
on
a
night
like
this
a
night
when
the
temperature
would
drop
to
fifteen
below
the
exhilaration
was
hard
to
explain
it
was
a
lonely
feeling
a
somehow
melancholy
feeling
he
was
outside
he
passed
on
the
wings
of
the
wind
and
none
of
the
people
beyond
the
brightly
lighted
squares
of
their
windows
saw
him
they
were
inside
inside
where
there
was
light
and
warmth
they
didn't
know
he
had
passed
them
only
he
knew
it
was
a
secret
thing
the
moving
air
burned
like
needles
but
it
was
fresh
and
clean
white
smoke
jetted
from
his
nose
in
neat
little
streams
and
as
sundown
came
the
last
of
the
day
a
cold
yellowyorange
line
on
the
western
horizon
the
first
stars
cruel
diamondchips
glimmering
in
the
sky
overhead
he
came
to
the
canal
he
was
only
three
blocks
from
home
now
and
eager
to
feel
the
heat
on
his
face
and
legs
moving
the
blood
again
making
it
tingle
still
he
paused
the
canal
was
frozen
in
its
concrete
sluice
like
a
frozen
river
of
rosemilk
its
surface
humped
and
cracked
and
cloudy
it
was
moveless
yet
completely
alive
in
this
harshly
puritanical
winterlight
it
had
its
own
unique
and
difficult
beauty
ben
turned
the
other
way
southwest
toward
the
barrens
when
he
looked
in
this
direction
the
wind
was
at
his
back
again
it
made
his
snowpants
ripple
and
flap
the
canal
ran
straight
between
its
concrete
walls
for
perhaps
half
a
mile
then
the
concrete
was
gone
and
the
river
prawled
its
way
into
the
barrens
at
this
time
of
the
year
a
skeletal
world
of
icy
brambles
and
jutting
naked
branches
a
figure
was
standing
on
the
ice
down
there
ben
stared
at
it
and
thought
there
may
be
a
man
down
there
but
can
he
be
wearing
what
it
looks
like
he
wearing
it
impossible
isn't
it
the
figure
was
dressed
in
what
appeared
to
be
a
whitesilver
clown
suit
it
rippled
around
him
in
the
polar
wind
there
were
oversized
orange
shoes
on
his
feet
they
matched
the
pompom
buttons
which
ran
down
the
front
of
his
suit
one
hand
grasped
a
bundle
of
strings
which
rose
to
a
bright
bunch
of
balloons
and
when
ben
observed
that
the
balloons
were
floating
in
his
direction
he
felt
unreality
wash
over
him
more
strongly
he
closed
his
eyes
rubbed
them
opened
them
the
balloons
still
appeared
to
be
floating
toward
him
he
heard
mr
fazio
voke
in
his
head
be
careful
of
de
fros'bite
boy
it
had
to
be
a
hallucination
or
a
mirage
brought
on
by
some
weird
trick
of
the
weather
there
could
be
a
man
down
there
on
the
ice
he
supposed
it
was
even
technically
possible
he
could
be
wearing
a
clown
suit
but
the
balloons
couldn't
be
floating
toward
ben
into
the
wind
yet
that
was
just
what
they
appeared
to
be
doing
ben
the
clown
on
the
ice
called
ben
thought
that
voice
was
only
in
his
mind
although
it
seemed
he
heard
it
with
his
ears
want
a
balloon
ben
there
was
something
so
evil
in
that
voice
so
awful
that
ben
wanted
to
run
away
as
fast
as
he
could
but
his
feet
seemed
as
velded
to
this
sidewalk
as
the
teetertotters
in
the
schoolyard
were
welded
to
the
ground
they
float
ben
they
all
float
try
one
and
see
the
clown
began
walking
along
the
ice
toward
the
canal
bridge
where
ben
stood
ben
watched
him
come
not
moving
he
watched
as
a
bird
watches
an
approaching
snake
the
balloons
should
have
burst
in
the
intense
cold
but
they
did
not
they
floated
above
and
ahead
of
the
clown
when
they
should
have
been
streaming
out
behind
him
trying
to
escape
back
into
the
barrens
where
some
part
of
ben
mind
assured
him
this
creature
had
come
from
in
the
first
place
now
ben
noticed
something
else
although
the
last
of
the
daylight
had
struck
a
rosy
glow
across
the
ice
of
the
canal
the
clown
cast
no
shadow
nore
at
all
you'll
like
it
here
ben
the
clown
said
now
it
was
close
enough
so
ben
could
hear
the
duddud
sound
its
funny
shoes
made
as
they
advanced
over
the
uneven
ice
you'll
like
it
here
i
promise
all
the
boys
and
girls
i
meet
like
it
here
because
it
like
pleasure
island
in
pinocchio
and
nevernever
land
in
peter
pan
they
never
have
to
grow
up
and
that
what
all
the
kiddies
want
so
come
on
see
the
sights
have
a
balloon
feed
the
elephants
ride
the
chutethe
chutes
oh
you'll
like
it
and
oh
ben
how
you'll
float
and
in
spite
of
his
fear
ben
found
that
part
of
him
did
want
a
balloon
who
in
all
the
world
owned
a
balloon
which
would
float
into
the
wind
who
had
even
heard
of
such
a
thing
yes
he
wanted
a
balloon
and
he
wanted
to
see
the
clown
face
which
was
bent
down
toward
the
ice
as
if
to
keep
it
out
of
that
killer
wind
what
might
have
happened
if
the
five
o'clock
whistle
atop
the
derry
town
hall
hadn't
blown
just
then
ben
didn't
know
didn't
want
to
know
the
important
thing
was
that
it
did
blow
an
icepick
of
sound
drilling
into
the
deep
winter
cold
the
clown
looked
up
as
if
startled
and
ben
saw
its
face
the
mummy
oh
my
god
it
the
mummy
was
his
first
thought
accompanied
by
a
swoony
horror
that
caused
him
to
clamp
his
hands
down
viciously
on
the
bridge
railing
to
keep
from
fainting
of
course
it
hadn't
been
the
mummy
couldn't
have
been
the
mummy
oh
there
were
egyptian
mummies
plenty
of
them
he
knew
that
but
his
first
thought
had
been
that
it
was
the
mummy
the
dusty
monster
played
by
boris
karloff
in
the
old
movie
he
had
stayed
up
late
to
watch
just
last
month
on
shock
theater
no
it
wasn't
that
mummy
couldn't
be
movie
monsters
weren't
real
everyone
knew
that
even
little
kids
but
it
wasn't
makeup
the
clown
was
wearing
nor
was
the
clown
simply
swaddled
in
a
bunch
of
bandages
there
were
bandages
most
of
them
around
its
neck
and
wrists
blowing
back
in
the
wind
but
ben
could
see
the
clown
face
clearly
it
was
deeply
lined
he
skin
a
parchment
map
of
wrinkles
tattered
cheeks
arid
flesh
the
skin
of
its
forehead
was
split
but
bloodless
dead
lips
grinned
back
from
a
maw
in
which
teeth
leaned
like
tombstones
its
gums
were
pitted
and
black
ben
could
see
no
eyes
but
something
glittered
far
back
in
the
charcoal
pits
of
those
puckered
sockets
something
like
the
cold
jewels
in
the
eyes
of
egyptian
scarab
beetles
and
although
the
wind
was
the
wrong
way
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
could
smell
cinnamon
and
spice
rotting
cerements
treated
with
weird
drugs
sand
blood
so
old
it
had
dried
to
flakes
and
grains
of
rust
we
all
float
down
here
the
mummyclown
croaked
and
ben
realized
with
fresh
horror
that
somehow
it
had
reached
the
bridge
it
was
now
just
below
him
reaching
up
with
a
dry
and
twisted
hand
from
which
flaps
of
skin
rustled
like
pennons
a
hand
through
which
bone
like
yellow
ivory
showed
one
almost
fleshless
finger
caressed
the
tip
of
his
boot
ben
paralysis
broke
he
pounded
the
rest
of
the
way
across
the
bridge
with
the
five
o'clock
whistle
still
shrieking
in
his
ears
it
only
ceased
as
he
reached
the
far
side
it
had
to
be
a
mirage
had
to
be
the
clown
simply
could
not
have
come
so
far
during
the
whistle
temor
fifteensecond
blast
but
his
fear
was
not
a
mirage
neither
were
the
hot
tears
which
spurted
from
his
eyes
and
froze
on
his
cheeks
a
second
after
being
shed
he
ran
boots
thudding
on
the
sidewalk
and
behind
him
he
could
hear
the
mummy
in
the
clown
suit
climbing
up
from
the
canal
ancent
stony
fingernails
scraping
across
iron
old
tendons
creaking
like
dry
hinges
he
could
hear
the
arid
whistle
of
its
breath
pulling
in
and
pushing
out
of
nostrils
as
devoid
of
moisture
as
the
tunnels
under
the
great
pyramid
he
could
smell
its
shroud
of
sandy
spices
and
he
knew
that
in
a
moment
its
hands
as
fleshless
as
the
geometrical
constructions
he
made
with
his
erector
set
would
descend
upon
his
shoulders
they
would
turn
him
around
and
he
would
stare
into
that
wrinkled
smiling
face
the
dead
river
of
its
breath
would
wash
over
him
those
black
eyesockets
with
their
deep
glowing
depths
would
bend
over
him
the
toothless
mouth
would
yawn
and
he
would
have
his
balloon
oh
yes
all
the
balloons
he
wanted
but
when
he
reached
the
corner
of
his
own
street
sobbing
and
winded
his
heart
slamming
crazed
leaping
beats
into
his
ears
when
he
at
last
looked
back
over
his
shoulder
the
street
was
empty
the
arched
bridge
with
its
low
concrete
sides
and
its
oldfashioned
cobblestone
paving
was
also
empty
he
could
not
see
the
canal
itself
but
he
felt
that
if
he
could
he
would
see
nothing
there
either
no
if
the
mummy
had
not
been
a
hallucination
or
a
mirage
if
it
had
been
real
it
would
be
waiting
under
the
bridge
like
the
troll
in
the
story
of
the
three
billy
goats
gruff
under
hiding
under
ben
hurried
home
looking
back
every
few
steps
until
the
door
was
safely
shut
and
locked
behind
him
he
explained
to
his
mother
who
was
so
tired
from
a
particularly
hard
day
at
the
mill
that
she
had
not
in
truth
much
missed
him
that
he
had
been
helping
mrs
douglas
count
books
then
he
sat
down
to
a
dinner
of
noodles
and
sunday
leftover
turkey
he
stuffed
three
helpings
into
himself
and
the
mummy
seemed
more
distant
and
dreamlike
with
each
helpng
it
was
not
real
those
things
were
never
real
they
came
fully
to
life
only
between
the
commercials
of
the
latenight
tv
movies
or
during
the
saturday
matinees
where
if
you
were
lucky
you
could
get
two
monsters
for
a
quarter
and
if
you
had
an
extra
quarter
you
could
buy
all
the
popcorn
you
could
eat
no
they
were
not
real
tv
monsters
and
movie
monsters
and
comicbook
monsters
were
not
real
not
until
you
went
to
bed
and
couldn't
sleep
not
until
the
last
four
pieces
ot
candy
wrapped
in
tissues
and
kept
under
your
pillow
against
the
evils
of
the
night
were
gobbled
up
not
until
the
bed
itself
turned
into
a
lake
of
rancid
dreams
and
the
wind
screamed
outside
and
you
were
afraid
to
look
at
the
window
because
there
might
be
a
face
there
an
ancient
gunning
face
that
had
not
rotted
but
simply
dried
like
an
old
leaf
its
eyes
sunken
diamonds
pushed
deep
into
dark
sockets
not
until
you
saw
one
ripped
and
claw
like
hand
holding
out
a
bunch
of
balloons
see
the
sights
have
a
balloon
feed
the
elephants
ride
the
chutethe
chutes
ben
oh
ben
how
you'll
float
ben
awoke
with
a
gasp
the
dream
of
the
mummy
still
on
him
panicked
by
the
close
vibrating
dark
all
around
him
he
jerked
and
the
root
stopped
supporting
him
and
poked
him
in
the
back
again
as
if
in
exasperation
he
saw
light
and
scrambled
for
it
he
crawled
out
into
afternoon
sunlight
and
the
babble
of
the
stream
and
everything
fell
into
place
again
it
was
summer
not
winter
the
mummy
had
not
carried
him
away
to
its
desert
cypt
ben
had
simply
hidden
from
the
big
kids
in
a
sandy
hole
under
a
halfuprooted
tree
he
was
in
the
barrens
henry
and
his
buddies
had
gone
to
town
in
a
small
way
on
a
couple
of
kids
playing
downstream
because
they
hadn't
been
able
to
find
ben
and
go
to
town
on
him
in
a
big
way
tata
boys
it
was
a
real
baby
dam
believe
me
you're
better
off
without
it
ben
looked
glumly
down
at
his
ruined
clothes
his
mother
was
going
to
give
him
sixteen
different
flavors
of
holy
old
hell
he
had
slept
just
long
enough
to
stiffen
up
he
slid
down
the
embankment
and
then
began
to
walk
along
the
stream
wincing
at
every
step
he
was
a
medley
of
aches
and
pains
it
felt
like
spike
jones
was
playing
a
fast
tune
on
broken
glass
inside
most
of
his
muscles
there
seemed
to
be
dried
or
drying
blood
on
every
inch
of
exposed
skin
the
dambuilding
kids
would
be
gone
anyway
he
consoled
himself
he
wasn't
sure
how
long
he'd
slept
but
even
if
it
had
only
been
half
an
hour
the
encounter
with
henry
and
his
friends
would
have
convinced
denbrough
and
his
pal
that
some
other
place
like
timbuktu
maybe
would
be
better
for
their
health
ben
plugged
grimly
along
knowing
if
the
big
kids
came
back
now
he
would
not
stand
a
chance
of
outrunning
them
he
hardly
cared
he
rounded
an
elbowbend
in
the
stream
and
just
stood
there
for
a
moment
looking
the
dambuilders
were
still
there
one
of
them
was
indeed
stuttering
bill
denbrough
he
was
kneeling
beside
the
other
boy
who
was
propped
against
the
streambank
in
a
sitting
position
this
other
kid
head
was
thrown
so
far
back
that
his
adam
apple
stood
out
like
a
triangular
plug
there
was
dried
blood
around
his
nose
on
his
chin
and
painted
along
his
neck
in
a
couple
of
streams
he
had
something
white
clasped
loosely
in
one
hand
stuttering
bill
looked
around
sharply
and
saw
ben
standing
there
ben
saw
with
dismay
that
something
was
very
wrong
with
the
boy
propped
up
on
the
bank
denbrough
was
obviously
scared
to
death
he
thought
miserably
won't
this
day
ever
end
i
wonder
if
yuhyuhyou
could
help
mm
m
bill
denbrough
said
hhis
ah

pirator
is
ehhempty
i
think
he
mmight
be
his
face
froze
turned
red
he
dug
at
the
word
stuttering
like
a
machinegun
spittle
flew
from
his
lips
and
it
took
almost
thirty
seconds
worth
of
ddd
before
ben
realized
denbrough
was
trying
to
say
the
other
kid
might
be
dying
chapter
bill
denbrough
beats
the
devil
i
bill
denbrough
thinks
i'm
damned
near
spacetravelling
i
might
as
well
be
inside
a
bullet
shot
from
a
gun
this
thought
although
perfectly
true
is
not
one
he
finds
especially
comfortable
in
fact
for
the
first
hour
following
the
concorde
takeoff
or
perhaps
liftoff
would
be
a
better
way
to
put
it
from
heathrow
he
has
been
coping
with
a
mild
case
of
claustrophobia
the
airplane
is
narrow
unsettlingly
so
the
meal
is
just
short
of
exquisite
but
the
flight
attendants
who
serve
it
must
twist
and
bend
and
squat
to
get
the
job
done
they
look
like
a
troupe
of
gymnasts
watching
this
strenuous
service
takes
some
of
the
pleasure
out
of
the
food
for
bill
although
his
seatmate
doesn't
seem
particularly
bothered
the
seatmate
is
another
drawback
he
fat
and
not
particularly
clean
it
may
be
ted
lapidus
cologne
on
top
of
his
skin
but
beneath
it
bill
detects
the
unmistakable
odors
of
dirt
and
sweat
he
not
being
very
particular
about
his
left
elbow
either
every
now
and
then
it
strikes
bill
with
a
soft
thud
his
eyes
are
drawn
again
and
again
to
the
digital
readout
at
the
front
of
the
cabin
it
shows
how
fast
this
british
bullet
is
going
now
as
the
concorde
reaches
its
cruising
speed
it
tops
out
at
just
over
mach
bill
takes
his
pen
from
his
shin
pocket
and
uses
its
tip
to
tap
buttons
on
the
computer
watch
audra
gave
him
last
christmas
if
the
machometer
is
right
and
bill
has
absolutely
no
reason
to
think
it
is
notthen
they
are
busting
along
at
a
speed
of
eighteen
miles
per
minute
he
is
not
sure
this
is
anything
he
really
wanted
to
know
outside
his
window
which
is
as
small
and
thick
as
the
window
in
one
of
the
old
mercury
space
capsules
he
can
see
a
sky
which
is
not
blue
but
the
twilight
purple
of
dusk
although
it
is
the
middle
of
the
day
at
the
point
where
the
sea
and
the
sky
meet
he
can
see
that
the
horizonline
is
slightly
bowed
i
am
sitting
here
bill
thinks
a
bloody
mary
in
my
hand
and
a
dirty
fat
man
elbow
poking
into
my
bicep
observing
the
curvature
of
the
earth
he
smiles
a
little
thinking
that
a
man
who
can
face
something
like
that
shouldn't
be
afraid
of
anything
but
he
is
afraid
and
not
just
of
flying
at
eighteen
miles
a
minute
in
this
narrow
fragile
shell
he
can
almost
feel
derry
rushing
at
him
and
that
is
exactly
the
right
expression
for
it
eighteen
miles
a
minute
or
not
the
sensation
is
of
being
perfectly
still
while
derry
rushes
at
him
like
some
big
carnivore
which
has
lain
in
wait
for
a
long
time
and
has
finally
broken
from
cover
derry
ah
derry
shall
we
write
an
ode
to
derry
the
stink
of
its
mills
and
its
rivers
the
dignified
quiet
of
its
treelined
streets
the
library
the
standpipe
bassey
park
derry
elementary
school
the
barrens
lights
are
going
on
in
his
head
big
kliegs
it
like
he
been
sitting
in
a
darkened
theater
for
twentyseven
years
waiting
for
something
to
happen
and
now
it
finally
begun
the
set
being
revealed
spot
by
spot
and
klieg
by
klieg
is
not
however
some
harmless
comedy
like
arsenic
and
old
lace
to
bill
denbrough
it
looks
more
like
the
cabinet
of
dr
caligari
all
those
stories
i
wrote
he
thinks
with
a
stupid
kind
of
amusement
all
those
novels
derry
is
where
they
all
came
from
derry
was
the
wellspring
they
came
from
what
happened
that
summer
and
from
what
happened
to
george
the
autumn
before
all
the
interviewers
that
ever
asked
me
that
question
i
gave
them
the
wrong
answer
the
fat
man
elbow
digs
into
him
again
and
he
spills
some
of
his
drink
bill
almost
says
something
then
thinks
better
of
it
that
question
of
course
was
where
do
you
get
your
ideas
it
was
a
question
bill
supposed
all
writers
of
fiction
had
to
answer
or
pretend
to
answer
at
least
twice
a
week
but
a
fellow
like
him
who
made
a
living
by
writing
of
things
which
never
were
and
never
could
be
had
to
answer
itor
pretend
to
much
more
often
than
that
all
writers
have
a
pipeline
which
goes
down
into
the
subconscious
he
told
them
neglecting
to
mention
that
he
doubted
more
as
each
year
passed
if
there
even
was
such
a
thing
as
a
subconscious
but
the
man
or
woman
who
writes
honor
stories
has
a
pipeline
that
goes
further
maybe
into
the
subsubconscious
if
you
like
elegant
answer
that
but
one
he
had
never
really
believed
subconscious
well
there
was
something
down
there
all
right
but
bill
thought
people
had
made
much
too
big
a
deal
out
of
a
function
which
was
probably
the
mental
equivalent
of
your
eyes
watering
when
dust
got
in
them
or
breaking
wind
an
hour
or
so
after
a
big
dinner
the
second
metaphor
was
probably
the
better
of
the
two
but
you
couldn't
very
well
tell
interviewers
that
as
far
as
you
were
concerned
such
things
as
dreams
and
vague
longings
and
sensations
like
déjavu
really
came
down
to
nothing
more
than
a
bunch
of
mental
farts
but
they
seemed
to
need
something
all
those
reporters
with
their
notebooks
and
their
little
japanese
taperecorders
and
bill
wanted
to
help
them
as
much
as
he
could
he
knew
that
writing
was
a
hard
job
a
damned
hard
job
there
was
no
need
to
make
theirs
harder
by
telling
them
my
friend
you
might
as
well
ask
me
who
cut
the
cheese
and
have
done
with
it
he
thought
now
you
always
knew
they
were
asking
the
wrong
question
even
before
mike
called
now
you
also
know
what
the
right
question
was
not
where
do
you
get
your
ideas
but
why
do
you
get
your
ideas
there
was
a
pipeline
all
right
but
it
wasn't
either
the
freudian
or
jungian
version
of
the
subconscious
that
it
came
out
of
no
interior
drainsystem
of
the
mind
no
subterranean
cavern
full
of
morlocks
waiting
to
happen
there
was
nothing
at
the
other
end
of
that
pipe
but
derry
just
derry
and
and
who
that
triptrapping
upon
my
bridge
he
sits
bolt
upright
suddenly
and
this
time
it
his
elbow
that
goes
wandering
it
sinks
deeply
into
his
fat
seatmate
side
for
a
moment
watch
yourself
buddy
the
fat
man
says
close
quarters
you
know
you
stop
whopping
me
with
yours
and
i'll
try
to
stop
wuhwhapping
you
with
mmine
the
fat
man
gives
him
a
sour
incredulous
whatthe
hellyoutalkingabout
look
bill
simply
gazes
at
him
until
the
fat
man
looks
away
muttering
who
there
who
triptrapping
over
my
bridge
he
looks
out
the
window
again
and
thinks
we're
beating
the
devil
his
arms
and
the
nape
of
his
neck
prickle
he
knocks
back
the
rest
of
his
drink
in
one
swallow
another
of
those
big
lights
has
gone
on
silver
his
bike
that
was
what
he
had
called
it
after
the
lone
ranger
horse
a
big
schwinn
twentyeight
inches
tall
you'll
kill
yourself
on
that
bill
his
father
had
said
but
with
no
real
concern
in
his
tone
he
had
shown
little
concern
for
anything
since
george
death
before
he
had
been
tough
fair
but
tough
since
you
could
get
around
him
he
would
make
fatherly
gestures
go
through
fatherly
motions
but
motions
and
gestures
were
all
they
were
it
was
like
he
was
always
listening
for
george
to
come
back
into
the
house
bill
had
seen
it
in
the
window
of
the
bike
and
cycle
shoppe
down
on
center
street
it
leaned
gloomily
on
its
kickstand
bigger
than
the
biggest
of
the
others
on
display
dull
where
they
were
shiny
straight
in
places
where
the
others
were
curved
bent
in
places
where
the
others
were
straight
propped
on
its
front
tire
had
been
a
sign
used
make
an
offer
what
actually
happened
was
that
bill
went
in
and
the
owner
made
him
an
offer
which
bill
took
he
wouldn't
have
known
how
to
dicker
with
the
cycle
shoppe
owner
if
his
life
depended
on
it
and
the
price
twentyfour
dollars
the
man
quoted
seemed
very
fair
to
bill
generous
even
he
paid
for
silver
with
money
he
had
saved
up
over
the
last
seven
or
eight
months
birthday
money
christmas
money
lawnmowing
money
he
had
been
noticing
the
bike
in
the
window
ever
since
thanksgiving
he
paid
for
it
and
wheeled
it
home
as
soon
as
the
snow
began
to
melt
for
good
it
was
funny
because
he'd
never
thought
much
about
owning
a
bike
before
last
year
the
idea
seemed
to
come
into
his
mind
all
at
once
perhaps
on
one
of
those
endless
days
after
george
died
was
murdered
in
the
beginning
bill
almost
did
kill
himself
the
first
ride
on
his
new
bike
ended
with
bill
dumping
it
on
purpose
to
keep
from
running
smack
into
the
board
fence
at
the
end
of
kossuth
lane
he
had
not
been
so
afraid
of
running
into
the
fence
as
he
had
been
of
bashing
right
through
it
and
falling
sixty
feet
into
the
barrens
he
came
away
from
that
one
with
a
five
inch
gash
running
between
the
wrist
and
elbow
of
his
left
arm
not
even
a
week
later
he
had
found
himself
unable
to
brake
soon
enough
and
had
shot
through
the
intersection
of
witcham
and
jackson
at
perhaps
thirtyfive
miles
an
hour
a
little
kid
on
a
dusty
gray
mastodon
of
a
bike
silver
was
silver
only
by
the
most
energetic
reach
of
a
willing
imagination
playing
cards
machinegunning
the
spokes
of
the
front
and
back
wheels
in
a
steady
roar
and
if
a
car
had
been
coming
he
would
have
been
dead
meat
just
like
georgie
he
got
control
of
silver
little
by
little
as
the
spring
advanced
neither
of
his
parents
noticed
during
that
time
that
he
was
conning
death
by
bicycle
he
thought
that
after
the
first
few
days
they
had
ceased
to
really
see
his
bike
at
all
to
them
it
was
just
a
relic
with
chipped
paint
which
leaned
against
the
garage
wall
on
rainy
days
silver
was
a
lot
more
than
some
dusty
old
relic
though
he
didn't
look
like
much
but
he
went
like
the
wind
bill
friend
his
only
real
friend
was
a
kid
named
eddie
kaspbrak
and
eddie
was
good
with
mechanical
things
he
had
shown
bill
how
to
get
silver
in
shape
which
bolts
to
tighten
and
check
regularly
where
to
oil
the
sprockets
how
to
tighten
the
chain
how
to
put
on
a
bike
patch
so
it
would
stay
if
you
got
a
flat
you
oughtta
paint
i
he
remembered
eddie
saying
one
day
but
bill
didn't
want
to
paint
silver
for
reasons
he
couldn't
even
explain
to
himself
he
wanted
the
schwinn
just
the
way
it
was
it
looked
like
a
real
bowwow
the
sort
of
bike
a
careless
kid
regularly
left
out
on
his
lawn
in
the
rain
a
bike
that
would
be
all
squeaks
and
shudders
and
slow
friction
it
looked
like
a
bowwow
but
it
went
like
the
wind
it
would
tt
would
beat
the
devi
he
says
aloud
and
laughs
his
fat
seatmate
looks
at
him
sharply
the
laugh
has
that
howling
quality
that
gave
audra
the
creeps
earlier
yes
it
looked
pretty
shoddy
with
its
old
paint
and
the
oldfashioned
package
carrier
mounted
above
the
back
wheel
and
the
ancient
oogahhorn
with
its
black
rubber
bulb
that
horn
was
permanently
welded
to
the
handlebars
with
a
rusty
bolt
the
size
of
a
baby
fist
pretty
shoddy
but
could
silver
go
could
he
christ
and
it
was
a
damned
good
thing
he
could
because
silver
had
saved
bill
denbrough
life
in
the
fourth
week
of
june
the
week
after
he
met
ben
hanscom
for
the
first
lime
the
week
after
he
and
ben
and
eddie
built
the
dam
the
week
that
ben
and
richie
trashmout
tozier
and
beverly
marsh
showed
up
in
the
barrens
after
the
saturday
matinee
richie
had
been
riding
behind
him
on
silver
package
carrier
the
day
silver
had
saved
bill
life
so
he
supposed
silver
had
saved
richie
too
and
he
remembered
the
house
they
had
been
running
from
all
right
he
remembered
that
just
fine
that
damned
house
on
neibolt
street
he
had
raced
to
beat
the
devil
that
day
oh
yeah
for
sure
don't
you
just
know
it
some
devil
with
eyes
as
shiny
as
old
deadly
coins
some
hairy
old
devil
with
a
mouthful
of
bloody
teeth
but
all
that
had
come
later
if
silver
had
saved
richie
life
and
his
own
that
day
then
perhaps
he
had
saved
eddie
kaspbrak
on
the
day
bill
and
eddie
met
ben
by
the
kicked
apart
remains
of
their
dam
in
the
barrens
henry
bowers
who
looked
a
little
bit
like
someone
had
run
him
through
a
disposall
had
mashed
eddie
nose
and
then
eddie
asthma
had
come
on
strong
and
few
aspirator
turned
up
empty
so
it
had
been
silver
that
day
too
silver
to
the
rescue
bill
denbrough
who
hasn't
been
on
a
bicycle
in
almost
seventeen
years
looks
out
the
window
of
an
airplane
that
would
not
have
been
credited
or
even
imagined
outside
of
a
sciencefiction
magazine
in
the
year
hiyo
silver
awayyy
he
thinks
and
has
to
close
his
eyes
against
the
sudden
needling
sting
of
tears
what
happened
to
silver
he
can't
remember
that
pan
of
the
set
is
still
dark
that
klieg
has
yet
to
be
turned
on
perhaps
that
is
just
as
well
perhaps
that
is
a
mercy
hiyo
hiyo
silver
hiyo
silver
awayyy
he
shouted
the
wind
tore
the
words
back
over
his
shoulder
like
a
fluttering
crepe
streamer
they
came
out
big
and
strong
those
words
in
a
triumphant
roar
they
were
the
only
ones
that
ever
did
he
pedaled
down
kansas
street
toward
town
gaining
speed
slowly
at
first
silver
rolled
once
he
got
going
but
getting
going
was
a
job
and
a
half
watching
the
gray
bike
pick
up
speed
was
a
little
like
watching
a
big
plane
roll
down
the
runway
at
first
you
couldn't
believe
such
a
huge
waddling
gadget
could
ever
actually
leave
the
earth
the
idea
was
absurd
but
then
you
could
see
its
shadow
beneath
it
and
before
you
even
had
time
to
wonder
if
it
was
a
mirage
the
shadow
was
trailing
out
long
behind
it
and
the
plane
was
up
cutting
its
way
through
the
air
as
sleek
and
graceful
as
a
dream
in
a
satisfied
mind
silver
was
like
that
bill
got
a
little
downhill
stretch
and
began
to
pedal
faster
his
legs
pumping
up
and
down
as
he
stood
forward
over
the
bike
fork
he
had
learned
very
quickly
after
being
bashed
a
couple
of
times
by
that
fork
in
the
worst
place
a
boy
can
be
bashed
to
yank
his
underpants
up
as
high
as
he
could
before
mounting
silver
later
that
summer
observing
this
process
richie
would
say
bill
does
that
because
he
thinks
he
might
like
to
have
some
kids
that
live
someday
it
seems
like
a
bad
idea
to
me
but
hey
they
might
always
take
after
his
wife
right
he
and
eddie
had
lowered
the
seat
as
far
as
it
would
go
and
it
now
bumped
and
scraped
against
the
small
of
his
back
as
he
worked
the
pedals
a
woman
digging
weeds
in
her
flower
garden
shaded
her
eyes
to
watch
him
pass
she
smiled
a
little
the
boy
on
the
huge
bike
reminded
her
of
a
monkey
she
had
once
seen
riding
a
unicycle
in
the
barnum
bailey
circus
he
apt
to
kill
himself
though
she
thought
turning
back
to
her
garden
that
bike
is
too
big
for
him
it
was
none
of
her
problem
though
bill
had
had
more
sense
than
to
argue
with
the
big
boys
when
they
broke
out
of
the
bushes
looking
like
illtempered
hunters
on
the
track
of
a
beast
which
had
already
mauled
one
of
them
eddie
however
had
rashly
opened
his
mouth
and
henry
bowers
had
unloaded
on
him
bill
knew
who
they
were
all
right
henry
belch
and
victor
were
just
about
the
worst
kids
in
derry
school
they
had
beaten
up
on
richie
tozier
who
bill
sometimes
chummed
with
a
couple
of
times
the
way
bill
looked
at
it
this
was
partly
richie
own
fault
he
was
not
known
as
trashmouth
for
nothing
one
day
in
april
richie
had
said
something
about
their
collars
as
the
three
of
them
passed
by
in
the
schoolyard
the
collars
had
all
been
turned
up
just
like
vie
morrow
in
the
blackboard
jungle
bill
who
had
been
sitting
against
the
building
nearby
and
listlessly
shooting
a
few
marbles
hadn't
really
caught
all
of
it
neither
did
henry
and
his
friends
but
they
heard
enough
to
turn
in
richie
direction
bill
supposed
richie
had
meant
to
say
whatever
he
said
in
a
low
voice
the
trouble
was
ric
hie
didn't
really
have
a
low
voice
what'd
you
say
you
little
foureyes
geek
victor
criss
enquired
didn't
say
nothing
richie
said
and
that
disclaimer
along
with
his
face
which
looked
quite
sensibly
dismayed
and
scared
might
have
ended
it
except
that
richie
mouth
was
like
a
halftamed
horse
that
has
a
way
of
bolting
for
absolutely
no
reason
at
all
now
it
suddenly
added
you
ought
to
dig
the
wax
out
of
your
ears
big
fella
want
some
blasting
powder
they
stood
looking
at
him
incredulously
for
a
moment
and
then
they
took
after
him
stuttering
bill
had
watched
the
unequal
race
from
its
start
to
its
preordained
conclusion
from
his
place
against
the
side
of
the
building
no
sense
getting
involved
those
three
galoots
would
be
just
as
happy
to
beat
up
on
two
kids
for
the
price
of
one
richie
ran
diagonally
across
the
littlekid
playyard
leaping
over
the
teetertotters
and
dodging
among
the
swings
realizing
he
had
run
into
a
blind
alley
only
when
he
struck
the
chainlink
feme
between
the
playyard
and
the
park
which
abutted
the
school
grounds
so
he
tried
to
go
up
the
chainlink
all
clutching
fingers
and
pointing
seeking
sneakertoes
and
he
was
maybe
twothirds
of
the
way
to
the
top
when
henry
and
victor
criss
hauled
him
back
down
again
henry
getting
him
by
the
back
of
the
jacket
and
victor
grabbing
the
seat
of
his
jeans
richie
was
screaming
when
they
peeled
him
off
the
fence
he
hit
the
asphalt
on
his
back
his
glasses
flew
off
he
reached
for
them
and
belch
huggins
kicked
them
away
and
that
was
why
one
of
the
bows
was
mended
with
adhesive
tape
this
summer
bill
had
winced
and
walked
around
to
the
front
of
the
building
he
had
observed
mrs
moran
one
of
the
fourth
grade
teachers
already
hurrying
over
to
break
things
up
but
he
knew
they
would
get
richie
hard
before
then
and
by
the
time
she
actually
arrived
richie
would
be
crying
bawl
baby
bawlbaby
lookitthebaby
bawl
bill
had
only
had
minor
problems
with
them
they
made
fun
of
his
stutter
of
course
an
occasional
random
cruelty
came
with
the
jibes
one
rainy
day
as
they
were
going
to
lunch
in
the
gym
belch
huggins
had
knocked
bill
lunchbag
out
of
his
hand
and
had
stomped
it
flat
with
one
engineer
boot
squishing
everything
inside
oh
juhjuhgee
belch
cried
in
mock
horror
raising
his
hands
and
fluttering
them
about
his
face
suhsuhsorry
about
your
lllunch
fuhhuhhuckface
and
he
had
strolled
off
down
the
hall
toward
where
victor
criss
was
leaning
against
the
drinking
fountain
outside
the
boys'room
door
just
about
laughing
himself
into
a
hernia
that
hadn't
been
so
bad
though
bill
had
cadged
half
a
pb
j
off
eddie
kaspbrak
and
richie
was
happy
to
give
him
his
devilled
egg
one
of
which
his
mother
packed
in
his
lunch
about
every
second
day
and
which
made
him
want
to
puke
he
claimed
but
you
had
to
stay
out
of
their
way
and
if
you
couldn't
do
that
you
had
to
try
and
be
invisible
eddie
forgot
the
rules
so
they
creamed
him
he
hadn't
been
too
bad
until
the
big
boys
went
downstream
and
splashed
across
to
the
other
side
even
though
his
nose
was
bleeding
like
a
fountain
when
eddie
snotrag
was
soaked
through
bill
had
given
him
his
own
and
made
him
put
a
hand
on
the
nape
of
his
neck
and
lean
his
head
back
bill
could
remember
his
mother
getting
georgie
to
do
that
because
georgie
sometimes
got
nosebleeds
oh
but
it
hurt
to
think
about
george
it
wasn't
until
the
sound
of
the
big
boys
buffalolike
progress
through
the
barrens
had
died
away
completely
and
eddie
nosebleed
had
actually
stopped
that
his
asthma
got
bad
he
started
heaving
for
air
his
hands
opening
and
then
snapping
shut
like
weak
traps
his
respiration
a
fluting
whistle
in
his
throat
shit
eddie
gasped
asthma
gripes
he
scrambled
for
lis
aspirator
and
finally
got
it
out
of
his
pocket
it
looked
almost
like
a
bottle
of
windex
the
kind
with
the
sprayer
attachment
on
top
he
jammed
it
into
his
mouth
and
punched
the
trigger
better
bill
asked
anxiously
no
it
empty
eddie
loked
at
bill
with
panicked
eyes
that
said
i’m
caught
bill
i'm
caught
the
empty
aspirator
rolled
away
from
his
hand
the
stream
chuckled
on
not
caring
in
the
least
that
eddie
kaspbrak
could
barely
breathe
bill
thought
randomly
that
the
big
boys
had
been
right
about
one
thing
it
had
been
a
real
baby
dam
but
they
had
been
having
fun
dammit
and
he
felt
a
sudden
dull
fury
that
it
should
have
come
to
this
tub
tuhtake
it
easy
eh
eddie
he
said
for
the
next
forty
minutes
or
so
bill
sat
next
to
him
his
expectation
that
eddie
asthma
attack
would
at
any
moment
let
up
gradually
fading
into
unease
by
the
time
ben
hanscom
appeared
the
unease
had
become
real
fear
it
not
only
wasn't
letting
up
it
was
getting
worse
and
the
center
street
drug
where
eddie
got
his
refills
was
three
miles
away
almost
what
il
he
went
to
get
eddie
stuff
and
came
back
to
rind
eddie
unconscious
unconscious
or
don't
shit
please
don't
think
that
or
even
dead
his
mind
insisted
implacably
like
georgie
dead
like
georgie]
don't
be
such
an
asshole
he
not
going
to
die
no
probably
not
but
what
if
he
came
back
and
found
eddie
in
a
comber
bill
knew
all
about
combers
he
had
even
deduced
they
were
named
after
those
great
big
waves
guys
surfed
on
in
hawaii
and
that
seemed
right
enough
after
all
what
was
a
comber
but
a
wave
that
drowned
your
brain
on
doctor
shows
like
ben
casey
people
were
always
going
into
combers
and
sometimes
they
stayed
there
in
spite
of
all
ben
casey
ill
tempered
shouting
so
he
sat
there
knowing
he
ought
to
go
he
couldn't
do
eddie
any
good
staying
here
but
not
wanting
to
leave
him
alone
an
irrational
superstitious
part
of
him
felt
sure
eddie
would
slip
into
a
comber
the
minute
he
bill
turned
his
back
then
he
looked
upstream
and
saw
ben
hanscom
standing
there
he
knew
who
ben
was
of
course
the
fattest
kid
in
any
school
has
his
or
her
own
sort
of
unhappy
notoriety
ben
was
in
the
other
fifth
grade
bill
sometimes
saw
him
at
recess
standing
by
himself
usually
in
a
comer
looking
at
a
book
and
eating
his
lunch
out
of
a
bag
about
the
size
of
a
laundry
sack
looking
at
ben
now
bill
thought
he
looked
even
worse
than
henry
bowers
it
was
hard
to
believe
but
true
bill
could
not
begin
to
imagine
the
cataclysmic
fight
these
two
must
have
been
in
ben
hair
stood
up
in
wild
dirtclotted
spikes
his
sweater
or
sweat
shirt
it
was
hard
to
tell
which
it
had
started
the
day
as
and
it
sure
as
shit
didn't
matter
now
was
a
matted
ruin
smeared
with
a
sicko
mixture
of
blood
and
grass
his
pants
were
out
at
the
knees
he
saw
bill
looking
at
him
and
recoiled
a
bit
eyes
going
wary
duhduhduhhon't
g
go
bill
cried
he
put
his
empty
hands
up
in
the
air
palms
out
to
show
he
was
harmless
ww
we
need
some
huhhuh
help
ben
came
closer
eyes
still
wary
he
walked
as
if
one
or
both
of
his
legs
was
killing
him
are
they
gone
bowers
and
those
guys
yuhye
bill
said
listen
cuhhan
yyyou
stay
with
my
fruhhend
while
i
go
get
his
muh
medicine
he
got
aaaa
asthma
bill
nodded
ben
came
all
the
way
down
to
the
remains
of
the
dam
and
dropped
painfully
to
one
knee
beside
eddie
who
was
lying
back
with
his
eyes
mostly
closed
and
his
chest
heaving
which
one
hit
him
ben
asked
finally
he
looked
up
and
bill
saw
the
same
frustrated
anger
he
had
been
feeling
himself
on
the
fat
kid
face
was
it
henry
bowers
bill
nodded
tt
figures
sure
go
on
i'll
stay
with
him
thuhthuhhanks
oh
don't
thank
m
ben
said
t'm
the
reason
they
landed
on
you
in
the
first
place
go
on
hurry
it
up
i
have
to
be
home
for
supper
bill
went
without
saying
anything
else
it
would
have
been
good
to
tell
ben
not
to
take
it
to
heart
what
had
happened
hadn't
been
ben
fault
any
more
than
it
had
been
eddie
for
stupidly
opening
his
mouth
guys
like
henry
and
his
buddies
were
an
accident
waiting
to
happen
the
little
kid
version
of
floods
or
tornadoes
or
gallstones
it
would
have
been
good
to
say
that
but
he
was
so
tightly
wound
nght
now
it
would
have
taken
him
about
twenty
minutes
or
so
and
by
then
eddie
might
have
slipped
into
a
comber
that
was
another
thing
bill
had
learned
from
drs
casey
and
kildare
you
never
went
into
a
comber
you
always
slipped
into
one
he
trotted
downstream
glancing
back
once
he
saw
ben
hanscom
grimly
collecting
rocks
from
the
edge
of
the
water
for
a
moment
bill
couldn't
figure
out
what
he
was
doing
and
then
he
understood
it
was
an
ammo
dump
just
in
case
they
came
back
the
barrens
were
no
mystery
to
bill
he
had
played
here
a
lot
this
spring
sometimes
with
richie
more
frequently
with
eddie
sometimes
all
by
himself
he
had
by
no
means
explored
the
whole
area
but
he
could
find
his
way
back
to
kansas
street
fom
the
kenduskeag
with
no
trouble
and
now
did
he
came
out
at
a
wooden
bridge
where
kansas
street
crossed
one
of
the
little
noname
streams
that
flowed
out
of
the
derry
drainage
system
and
into
the
kenduskeag
down
below
silver
was
stashed
under
this
bridge
his
handlebars
tied
to
one
of
the
bridge
supports
with
a
hank
of
rope
to
keep
his
wheels
out
of
the
water
bill
untied
the
rope
stuck
it
in
his
shirt
and
hauled
silver
up
to
the
sidewalk
by
main
force
panting
and
sweating
losing
his
balance
a
couple
of
times
and
landing
on
his
tail
but
at
last
it
was
up
bill
swung
his
leg
over
the
high
fork
and
as
always
once
he
was
on
silver
he
became
someone
else
hiyo
silver
aw
a
yy
the
words
came
out
deeper
than
his
normal
speaking
voice
it
was
almost
the
voice
of
the
man
he
would
become
silver
gained
speed
slowly
the
quickening
clicketyciack
of
the
bicycle
playing
cards
clothespinned
to
the
spokes
marking
the
increase
bill
stood
on
the
pedals
his
hands
clamped
on
the
bikegrips
with
the
wrists
turned
up
he
looked
like
a
man
trying
to
lift
a
stupendously
heavy
barbell
cords
stood
out
on
his
neck
veins
pulsed
in
his
temples
his
mouth
was
turned
down
in
a
trembling
sneer
of
effort
as
he
fought
the
familiar
battle
against
weght
and
inertia
busting
his
brains
to
get
silver
moving
as
always
it
was
worth
the
effort
silver
began
to
roll
along
more
briskly
houses
slid
past
smoothly
instead
of
just
poking
by
on
his
left
where
kansas
street
crossed
jackson
the
unfettered
kenduskeag
became
the
canal
past
the
intersection
kansas
street
headed
swiftly
downhill
toward
center
and
main
berry
business
district
streets
crossed
frequently
here
but
they
were
all
stopsigned
in
bill
favor
and
the
possibility
that
a
driver
might
one
day
blow
by
one
of
those
stop
signs
and
flatten
him
to
a
bleeding
shadow
on
the
street
had
never
crossed
bill
mind
it
is
unlikely
he
would
have
changed
his
ways
even
if
it
had
he
might
have
done
so
either
earlier
or
later
in
his
life
but
this
spring
and
early
summer
had
been
a
strange
thundery
time
for
him
ben
would
have
been
astounded
if
someone
were
to
ask
him
if
he
was
lonely
bill
would
have
been
likewise
astounded
if
someone
asked
him
if
he
was
courting
death
of
cuhcuhcourse
nnot
he
would
have
responded
immediately
and
indignantly
but
that
did
not
change
the
fact
that
his
runs
down
kansas
street
to
town
had
become
more
and
more
like
banzai
charges
as
the
weather
warmed
this
section
of
kansas
street
was
known
as
upmile
hill
bill
took
it
at
full
speed
bent
over
silver
handlebars
to
cut
down
the
wind
resistance
one
hand
poised
over
the
cracked
rubber
bulb
of
his
oogahhorn
to
warn
the
unwary
his
red
hair
blowing
back
from
his
head
in
a
rippling
wave
the
click
of
the
playing
cards
had
mounted
to
a
steady
roar
the
effortful
sneer
had
become
a
big
goofball
grin
the
residences
on
the
right
had
given
way
to
business
buildings
warehouses
and
meatpacking
plants
most
of
them
which
blurred
by
in
a
scary
but
satisfying
rush
to
his
left
the
canal
was
a
wink
of
fire
in
the
corner
of
his
eye
hiyo
silver
awayyy
he
screamed
triumphantly
silver
flew
over
the
first
curbing
and
as
they
almost
always
did
at
that
point
his
feet
lost
contact
with
the
pedals
he
was
freewheeling
now
wholly
in
the
lap
of
whatever
god
has
been
appointed
the
job
of
protecting
small
boys
he
swerved
into
the
street
doing
maybe
fifteen
miles
an
hour
over
the
posted
speed
of
twentyfive
it
was
all
behind
him
now
his
stutter
his
dad
blank
hurt
eyes
as
he
puttered
around
his
garage
workshop
the
terrible
sight
of
the
dust
on
the
closed
piano
cover
upstairs
dusty
because
his
mother
didn't
play
anymore
the
last
time
had
been
at
george
funeral
three
methodist
hymns
george
gong
out
into
the
rain
wearing
his
yellow
slicker
carrying
the
newspaper
boat
with
its
glaze
of
paraffin
mr
gardener
coming
up
the
street
twenty
minutes
later
with
his
body
wrapped
in
a
bloodstained
quilt
his
mother
agonized
shriek
all
behind
him
he
was
the
lone
ranger
he
was
john
wayne
he
was
bo
diddley
he
was
anybody
he
wanted
to
be
and
nobody
who
cried
and
got
scared
and
wanted
his
muh
mub
mother
silver
flew
and
stuttering
bill
denbrough
flew
with
him
their
gantry
like
shadow
fled
behind
them
they
raced
down
upmile
hill
together
the
playing
cards
roared
bill
feet
found
the
pedals
again
and
he
began
to
pump
wanting
to
go
even
faster
wanting
to
reach
some
hypothetical
speed
not
of
sound
but
of
memory
and
crash
through
the
pain
barrier
he
raced
on
bent
over
his
handlebars
he
raced
to
beat
the
devil
the
threeway
intersection
of
kansas
center
and
main
was
coming
up
fast
it
was
a
horror
of
oneway
traffic
and
conflicting
signs
and
stoplights
which
were
supposed
to
be
timed
but
really
weren't
the
result
a
derry
news
editorial
had
proclaimed
the
year
before
was
a
trafficrotary
conceived
in
hell
as
always
bill
eyes
flicked
right
and
left
fast
gauging
the
traffic
flow
looking
for
the
holes
if
his
judgment
was
mistaken
if
he
stuttered
you
might
say
he
would
be
badly
hurt
or
killed
he
arrowed
into
the
slowmoving
traffic
which
dogged
the
intersection
running
a
red
light
and
fading
to
the
right
to
avoid
a
lumbering
portholed
buick
he
shot
a
bullet
of
a
glance
back
over
his
shoulder
to
make
sure
the
middle
lane
was
empty
he
looked
forward
again
and
saw
that
in
roughly
five
seconds
he
was
going
to
crash
into
the
rear
end
of
a
pickup
truck
that
had
stopped
squarely
in
the
middle
of
the
intersection
while
the
uncle
ike
type
behind
the
wheel
craned
his
neck
to
read
all
the
signs
and
make
sure
he
hadn't
taken
a
wrong
turn
and
somehow
ended
up
in
miami
beach
the
lane
on
bill
right
was
full
of
a
derry
bangor
intercity
bus
he
slipped
in
that
direction
just
the
same
and
shot
the
gap
between
the
stopped
pickup
and
the
bus
still
moving
at
forty
miles
an
hour
at
the
last
second
he
snapped
his
head
hard
to
one
side
like
a
soldier
doing
an
overenthusiastic
eyesright
to
keep
the
mirror
mounted
on
the
passenger
side
of
the
pickup
from
rearranging
his
teeth
hot
diesel
from
the
bus
laced
his
throat
like
a
kick
of
strong
liquor
he
heard
a
thin
gasping
squeal
as
one
of
his
bikegrips
kissed
a
line
up
the
coach
aluminum
side
he
got
just
a
glimpse
of
the
bus
driver
his
face
paperwhite
under
his
peaked
hudson
bus
company
cap
the
driver
was
shaking
his
fist
at
bill
and
shouting
something
bill
doubted
it
was
happy
birthday
here
was
a
trio
of
old
ladies
crossing
main
street
from
the
new
england
bank
sde
to
the
shoeboat
side
they
heard
the
harsh
burr
of
the
playing
cards
and
looked
up
their
mouths
dropped
open
as
a
boy
on
a
huge
bike
passed
within
half
a
foot
of
them
like
a
mirage
the
worst
and
the
best
of
the
trip
was
behind
him
now
he
had
looked
at
the
very
real
possibility
of
his
own
death
again
and
again
had
found
himself
able
to
look
away
the
bus
had
not
crushed
him
he
had
not
killed
himself
and
the
three
old
ladies
with
their
freese
shopping
bags
and
their
social
security
checks
le
had
not
been
splattered
across
the
tailgate
of
uncle
ike
old
dodge
pickup
he
was
going
uphill
again
now
speed
bleeding
away
something
oh
call
it
desire
that
was
good
enough
wasn't
it
was
bleeding
away
with
it
all
the
thoughts
and
memories
were
catching
up
in
bill
gee
we
almost
lost
sight
of
you
for
awhile
there
but
here
we
are
rejoining
him
climbing
up
his
shirt
and
jumping
into
his
ear
and
whooshing
into
his
brain
like
little
kids
going
down
a
slide
he
could
feel
them
settling
into
their
accustomed
places
their
feverish
bodies
jostling
each
other
gosh
wow
here
we
are
inside
bill
head
again
let
think
about
george
okay
who
wants
to
start
you
think
too
much
bill
no
that
wasn't
the
problem
the
problem
was
he
imagined
too
much
he
turned
into
richard
alley
and
came
out
on
center
street
a
few
moments
later
pedaling
slowly
feeling
the
sweat
on
his
back
and
in
his
hair
he
dismounted
silver
in
front
of
the
center
street
drug
store
and
went
inside
before
george
death
bill
would
have
gotten
the
salient
points
across
to
mr
keene
by
speaking
to
him
the
druggist
was
not
exactly
kind
or
at
least
bill
had
an
idea
he
was
not
but
he
was
patient
enough
and
he
did
not
tease
or
make
fun
but
now
bill
stutter
was
much
worse
and
he
really
was
afraid
something
bad
might
happen
to
eddie
if
he
didn't
move
fast
so
when
mr
keene
said
hello
billy
denbrough
can
i
help
you
bill
took
a
folder
advertising
vitamins
turned
it
over
and
wrote
on
the
back
eddie
kaspbrak
and
i
were
playing
in
the
barrens
he
got
a
bad
assmar
attack
i
mean
he
can
hardly
breath
canyon
give
me
a
refill
on
his
asspirador
he
pushed
this
note
across
the
glasstopped
counter
to
mr
keene
who
read
it
looked
at
bill
anxious
blue
eyes
and
said
of
course
wait
right
here
and
don't
be
handling
anything
you
shouldn't
bill
shifted
impatiently
from
one
foot
to
the
other
while
mr
keene
was
behind
the
rear
counter
although
he
was
back
there
less
than
five
minutes
it
seemed
an
age
before
he
returned
with
one
of
eddie
plastic
squeezebottles
he
handed
it
over
to
bill
smiled
and
said
this
should
take
care
of
the
problem
th
thth
thanks
bill
said
i
don't
have
a
any
mmmuhmuh
that
all
right
son
mrs
kaspbrak
has
an
account
here
i'll
just
add
this
on
i'm
sure
she'll
want
to
thank
you
for
your
kindness
bill
much
relieved
thanked
mr
keene
and
left
quickly
mr
keene
came
around
the
counter
to
watch
him
go
he
saw
bill
toss
the
aspirator
into
his
bikebasket
and
mount
clumsily
can
he
actually
ride
a
bike
that
big
mr
keene
wondered
i
doubt
it
i
doubt
it
very
much
but
the
denbrough
kid
somehow
got
it
going
without
falling
on
his
head
and
pedaled
slowly
away
the
bike
which
looked
to
mr
keene
like
somebody
idea
of
a
joke
wobbled
madly
from
side
to
side
the
aspirator
rolled
back
and
forth
in
the
basket
mr
keene
grinned
a
little
if
bill
had
seen
that
grin
it
might
have
gone
a
good
way
toward
confirming
his
idea
that
mr
keene
vas
not
exactly
one
of
the
world
champion
nice
guys
it
was
sour
the
grin
of
a
man
who
has
found
much
to
wonder
about
but
almost
nothing
to
uplift
in
the
human
condition
yes
he
would
add
eddie
asthma
medication
to
sonia
kaspbrak
bill
and
as
always
she
would
be
surprised
and
suspicious
rather
than
grateful
at
how
cheap
the
medication
was
other
drugs
were
so
dear
she
said
mrs
kaspbrak
mr
keene
knew
was
one
of
those
people
who
believed
nothing
cheap
could
do
a
person
much
good
he
could
really
have
soaked
her
for
her
son
hydrox
mist
and
there
had
been
times
when
he
had
been
tempted
but
why
should
he
make
himself
a
party
to
the
woman
foolishness
it
wasn't
as
though
he
were
going
to
starve
cheap
oh
my
yes
hydrox
mist
administer
as
needed
typed
neatly
on
the
gummed
label
he
pasted
on
each
aspirator
bottle
was
wonderfully
cheap
but
even
mrs
kaspbrak
was
willing
to
admit
that
it
controlled
her
son
asthma
quite
well
in
spite
of
that
fact
it
was
cheap
because
it
was
nothing
but
a
combination
of
hydrogen
and
oxygen
with
a
dash
of
camphor
added
to
give
the
mist
a
faint
medicinal
taste
in
other
words
eddie
asthma
medicine
was
tapwater
it
took
bill
longer
to
get
back
because
he
was
going
uphill
in
several
places
he
had
to
dismount
and
push
silver
he
simply
didn't
have
the
musclepower
necessary
to
keep
the
bike
going
up
more
than
mild
slopes
by
the
time
he
had
stashed
his
bike
and
made
his
way
back
to
the
stream
it
was
ten
past
four
all
sorts
of
black
suppositions
were
crossing
his
mind
the
hanscom
kid
would
have
deserted
leaving
eddie
to
die
or
the
bullies
could
have
backtracked
and
beaten
the
shit
out
of
both
of
them
or
worst
of
all
the
man
whose
business
was
murdering
kids
might
have
gotten
one
or
both
of
them
as
he
had
gotten
george
he
knew
there
had
been
a
great
deal
of
gossip
and
speculation
about
that
bill
had
a
bad
stutter
but
he
wasn't
deaf
although
people
sometimes
seemed
to
think
he
must
be
since
he
spoke
only
when
absolutely
necessary
some
people
felt
that
the
murder
of
his
brother
wasn't
related
at
all
to
the
murders
of
betty
ripsom
cheryl
lamonica
matthew
clements
and
veronica
grogan
others
claimed
that
george
ripsom
and
lamonica
had
been
killed
by
one
man
and
the
other
two
were
the
work
of
a
copycat
killer
a
third
school
of
thought
held
that
the
boys
had
been
killed
by
one
man
the
girls
by
another
bill
believed
they
had
all
been
killed
by
the
same
person
if
it
was
a
person
he
sometimes
wondered
about
that
as
he
sometimes
wondered
about
his
feelings
concerning
derry
this
summer
was
it
still
the
aftermath
of
george
death
the
way
his
parents
seemed
to
ignore
him
now
so
lost
in
their
grief
over
their
younger
son
that
they
couldn't
see
the
simpk
fact
that
bill
was
still
alive
and
might
be
hurting
himself
those
things
combined
with
the
other
murders
the
voices
that
sometimes
seemed
to
speak
in
his
head
now
whispering
to
him
and
surely
they
were
not
variations
of
his
own
voice
for
these
voices
did
not
stutter
they
were
quiet
but
they
were
sure
advising
him
to
do
certain
things
but
not
others
was
it
those
things
which
made
derry
seem
somehow
different
now
somehow
threatening
with
unexplored
streets
that
did
not
invite
but
seemed
instead
to
yawn
in
a
kind
of
ominous
silence
that
made
some
faces
look
secret
and
frightened
he
didn't
know
but
he
believed
as
he
believed
all
the
murders
were
the
work
of
a
single
agency
that
derry
really
had
changed
and
that
his
brother
death
had
signalled
the
beginning
of
that
change
the
black
suppositions
in
his
head
came
from
the
lurking
idea
that
anything
could
happen
in
derry
now
anything
but
when
he
came
around
the
last
bend
all
looked
cool
ben
hanscom
was
still
there
sitting
beside
eddie
eddie
himself
was
sitting
up
now
his
hands
dangling
in
his
lap
head
bent
still
wheezing
the
sun
had
sunk
low
enough
to
project
long
green
shadows
across
the
stream
boy
that
was
quick
ben
said
standing
up
i
didn't
expect
you
for
another
half
an
hour
i
got
a
fffast
bbik
bill
said
with
some
pride
for
a
moment
the
two
of
them
looked
at
each
other
cautiously
warily
then
ben
smiled
tentatively
and
bill
smiled
back
the
kid
was
fat
but
he
seemed
okay
and
he
had
stayed
put
that
must
have
taken
some
guts
with
henry
and
his
j.d
friends
maybe
still
wandering
around
out
there
someplace
bill
winked
at
eddie
who
was
looking
at
him
with
dumb
gratitude
hhere
you
go
ee
eeddie
he
tossed
him
the
aspirator
eddie
plinged
it
into
his
open
mouth
triggered
it
and
gasped
convulsively
then
he
leaned
back
eyes
shut
ben
watched
this
with
concern
jeez
he
really
got
it
bad
doesn't
he
bill
nodded
i
was
scared
there
for
awhile
ben
said
in
a
low
voice
i
was
wonderin
what
to
do
if
he
had
a
convulsion
or
something
i
kept
tryin
to
remember
the
stuff
they
told
us
in
that
red
cross
assembly
we
had
in
april
all
i
could
come
up
with
was
put
a
stick
in
his
mouth
so
he
wouldn't
bite
his
tongue
off
i
think
that
for
ehehhepileptics
oh
yeah
i
guess
you're
right
he
wwon't
have
a
ccconvulsion
anyway
bill
said
that
m
m
medicine
will
ffix
him
right
up
luhluhlook
eddie
labored
breathing
had
eased
he
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
up
at
them
thanks
bill
he
said
that
one
was
a
real
pisswah
i
guess
it
started
when
they
creamed
your
nose
huh
ben
asked
eddie
laughed
ruefully
stood
up
and
stuck
the
aspirator
in
his
back
pocket
wasn't
even
thinking
about
my
nose
was
thinking
about
my
mom
yeah
really
ben
sounded
surprised
but
his
hand
went
to
the
rags
of
his
sweatshirt
and
began
fiddling
there
nervously
she
gonna
take
one
look
at
the
blood
on
my
shirt
and
have
me
down
to
the
mergency
room
at
derry
home
in
about
five
seconds
why
ben
asked

it
gee
i
remember
this
kid
i
was
in
kindergarten
with
scooter
morgan
and
he
got
a
bloody
nose
when
he
fell
off
the
monkey
bars
they
took
him
to
the
mergency
room
but
only
because
it
kept
bleeding

he
dddie
no
but
he
was
out
of
school
a
week

said
gloomily

pieces
of
bone
sticking
in
my
brain

the
most
interesting
conversation
he'd
had
in
weeks

listen
to
my
mother

this
orderly
once
he
told
her
they

make
her
pay
rent
she
was
really
po'd
wow
ben
said
he
thought
eddie
mother
must
be
really
weird
he
was
unconscious
of
the
fact
that
now
both
of
his
hands
were
fiddling
in
the
remains
of
his
sweatshirt
why
don't
you
just
say
no
say
something
like
hey

feel
all
right

just
want
to
stay
home
and
watch

eddie
said
uncomfortably
and
said
no

fudd
suhhorry
well
i'm
pleased
to
meet
you
both
ben
said
it
came
out
sounding
prissy
and
a
little
lame
a
silence
fell
amid
the
three
of
them
it
was
not
an
entirely
uncomfortable
silence
it
they
became
friends
why
were
those
guys
chasing
you
eddie
asked
at
last
they're
aaalways
chuhhasing
ssomeon
bill
said
i
hhate
those
fuckers
ben
was
silent
a
moment
mostly
in
admiration
before
bill
use
of
what
ben
mother
sometimes
called
the
really
bad
word
ben
had
never
said
the
really
bad
word
out
loud
in
his
whole
life
although
he
had
written
it
in
extremely
small
letters
on
a
telephone
pole
the
halloween
before
last
bowers
ended
up
sitting
next
to
me
during
the
exams
ben
said
at
last
he
wanted
to
copy
off
my
paper
i
wouldn't
let
him
you
must
want
to
die
young
kid
eddie
said
admiringly
stuttering
bill
burst
out
laughing
ben
looked
at
him
sharply
decided
he
wasn't
being
laughed
at
exactly
it
was
hard
to
say
how
he
knew
it
but
he
did
and
grinned
guess
i
must
he
said
anyway
he
got
to
take
summerschool
and
he
and
those
other
two
guys
were
laying
for
me
and
that
what
happened
yyou
look
like
tt
they
kuhhilled
you
bill
said
i
fell
down
here
from
kansas
street
down
the
side
of
the
hill
he
looked
at
eddie
t'll
probably
see
you
in
the
mergency
room
now
that
i
think
about
it
when
my
mom
gets
a
look
at
my
clothes
she'll
put
me
there
both
bill
and
eddie
burst
out
laughing
this
time
and
ben
joined
them
it
hurt
his
stomach
to
laugh
but
he
laughed
anyway
shrilly
and
a
little
hysterically
finally
he
had
to
sit
down
on
the
bank
and
the
plopping
sound
his
butt
made
when
it
hit
the
dirt
got
him
going
all
over
again
he
liked
the
way
his
laughter
sounded
with
theirs
it
was
a
sound
he
had
never
heard
before
not
mingled
laughter
he
had
heard
that
lots
of
times
but
mingled
laughter
of
which
his
own
was
a
part
he
looked
up
at
bill
denbrough
their
eyes
met
and
that
was
all
it
took
to
get
both
of
them
laughing
again
bill
hitched
up
his
pants
flipped
up
the
collar
of
his
shirt
and
began
to
slouch
around
in
a
kind
of
moody
hoody
strut
his
voice
dropped
down
low
and
he
said
i'm
gonna
killya
kid
don't
gimme
no
crap
i'm
dumb
but
i'm
big
i
can
crack
walnuts
with
my
forehead
i
can
piss
vinegar
and
shit
cement
my
name
honeybunch
bowers
and
i'm
the
boss
prick
round
dese
yere
derry
parts
eddie
had
collapsed
to
the
streambank
now
and
was
rolling
around
clutching
his
stomach
and
howling
ben
was
doubled
up
head
between
his
knees
tears
spouting
from
his
eyes
snot
hanging
from
his
nose
in
long
white
runners
laughing
like
a
hyena
bill
sat
down
with
them
and
little
by
little
the
three
of
them
quieted
there
one
really
good
thing
about
it
eddie
said
presently
if
bowers
is
in
summer
school
we
won't
see
him
much
down
here
you
play
in
the
barrens
a
lo
ben
asked
it
was
an
idea
that
never
would
have
crossed
his
own
mind
in
a
thousand
years
not
with
the
reputation
the
barrens
had
but
now
that
he
was
down
here
it
didn't
seem
bad
at
all
in
fact
this
stretch
of
the
low
bank
was
very
pleasant
as
the
afternoon
made
its
slow
way
toward
dusk
sssure
it
nneat
mmostly
nnobody
bbuhbothers
wus
down
irhere
we

uhother
gguys

ddown
here
eheh
anyway
you
and
eddie
ruhruhruh
bill
shook
his
head
his
face
knotted
up
like
a
wet
dishrag
when
he
stuttered
ben
noticed
and
suddenly
an
odd
thought
occurred
to
him
bill
hadn't
stuttered
at
all
when
he
was
mocking
the
way
henry
bowers
talked
richie
bill
exclaimed
now
paused
a
moment
and
then
went
on
richie
ftozier
usually
ccomes
down
too
but
khim
and
his
ddad
were
going
to
clean
out
their
ah
ah
ah
attic
eddie
translated
and
tossed
a
stone
into
the
water
plonk
yeah
i
know
hi
ben
said
you
guys
come
down
here
a
lot
huh
the
idea
fascinated
him
and
made
him
feel
a
stupid
sort
of
longing
as
well
puhpuhpretty
much
bill
said
wuhwhy
ddon't
you
cccome
back
down
tuhhuh
morrow
mme
and
ee
eddie
were
tubtrying
to
make
a
duhduhham
ben
could
say
nothing
he
was
astounded
not
only
by
the
offer
but
by
the
simple
and
unstudied
casualness
with
which
it
had
come
maybe
we
ought
to
do
something
else
eddie
said
the
dam
wasn't
working
so
hot
anyway
ben
got
up
and
walked
down
to
the
stream
brushing
the
dirt
from
his
huge
hams
there
were
still
matted
piles
of
small
branches
at
either
side
of
the
stream
but
anything
else
they'd
put
together
had
washed
away
you
ought
to
have
some
boards
ben
said
get
boards
and
put
em
in
a
row
facing
each
other
like
the
bread
of
a
sandwich
bill
and
eddie
were
looking
at
him
puzzled
ben
dropped
to
one
knee
loo
he
said
boards
here
and
here
you
stick
em
in
the
streambed
facing
each
other
okay
then
before
the
water
can
wash
them
away
you
fill
up
the
space
between
them
with
rocks
and
sand
wuh
wuh
we
bill
said
huh
wuhwe
do
it
oh
ben
said
feeling
and
looking
he
was
sure
extremely
stupid
but
he
didn't
care
if
he
looked
stupid
because
he
suddenly
felt
very
happy
he
couldn't
even
remember
the
last
time
he
felt
this
happy
yeah
we
anyway
if
you
we
fill
up
the
space
in
between
with
rocks
and
stuff
it'll
stay
the
upstream
board
will
lean
back
against
the
rocks
and
dirt
as
the
water
piles
up
the
second
board
would
tilt
back
and
wash
away
after
awhile
i
guess
but
if
we
had
a
third
board
well
look
he
drew
in
the
dirt
with
a
stick
bill
and
eddie
kaspbrak
leaned
over
and
studied
this
little
drawing
with
sober
interest
boards
rocks
sand
strut
you
ever
built
a
dam
before
eddie
asked
his
tone
was
respectful
almost
awed
nope
then
th
how
do
you
know
this'll
wwwor
ben
looked
at
bill
puzzled
sure
it
will
he
said
why
wouldn't
it
but
khow
do
you
nuh
nuhkno
bill
asked
ben
recognized
the
tone
of
the
question
as
one
not
of
sarcastic
disbelief
but
honest
interest
how
can
y
you
tell
i
just
know
ben
said
he
looked
down
at
his
drawing
in
the
dirt
again
as
if
to
confirm
it
to
himself
he
had
never
seen
a
cofferdam
in
his
life
either
in
diagram
or
in
fact
and
had
no
idea
that
he
had
just
drawn
a
pretty
fair
representation
of
one
ooka
bill
said
and
clapped
ben
on
the
back
ssee

old

next
block

bunch
of
em

ben

for

you
guys
uh

to
bill
said
the
three
of
them
left
the
barrens
together
ben
helped
bill
push
silver
up
the
embankment
eddie
trailed
behind
them
wheezing
again
and
looking
unhappily
at
his
blood
spotted
shirt
bill
said
goodbye
and
then
pedaled
off
shouting
hiyo
silver
awayyy
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
that
a
gigantic
bike
ben
said
bet
your
fur
eddie
said
he
had
taken
another
gulp
from
his
aspirator
and
was
breathing
normally
again
he
rides
me
double
sometimes
on
the
back
goes
so
fast
it
just
about
scares
the
crap
outta
me
he
a
good
man
bill
is
he
said
this
last
in
an
offhand
way
but
his
eyes
said
something
more
emphatic
they
were
worshipful
you
know
about
what
happened
to
his
brother
don't
you
no
what
about
him
got
killed
last
fail
some
guy
killed
him
pulled
one
of
his
arms
right
off
just
like
pulling
a
wing
off
n
a
fly
jeezumcro
bill
he
used
to
only
stutter
a
little
now
it
really
bad
did
you
notice
that
he
stutter
well
a
little
but
his
brains
don't
stutter
get
what
i
mean
yeah
anyway
i
just
told
you
because
if
you
want
bill
to
be
your
friend
it
better
not
to
talk
to
him
about
his
little
brother
don't
ask
him
questions
or
anythin
he
all
frigged
up
about
it
man
i
would
be
too
ben
said
he
remembered
now
vaguely
about
the
little
kid
who
had
been
killed
the
previous
fall
he
wondered
if
his
mother
had
been
thinking
about
george
denbrough
when
she
gave
him
the
watch
he
now
wore
or
only
about
the
more
recent
killings
did
it
happen
right
after
the
big
flood
yeah
they
had
reached
the
corner
of
kansas
and
jackson
where
they
would
have
to
split
up
kids
ran
here
and
there
playing
tag
and
throwing
baseballs
one
dorky
little
kid
in
big
blue
shorts
went
trotting
selfimportantly
past
ben
and
eddie
wearing
a
davy
crockett
coonskin
backward
so
that
the
tail
hung
down
between
his
eyes
he
was
rolling
a
hula
hoop
and
yelling
hooptag
you
guys
hooptag
wanna
the
two
bigger
boys
looked
after
him
amused
and
then
eddie
said
well
i
gotta
go
wait
a
se
ben
said
i
got
an
idea
if
you
really
don't
want
to
go
to
the
mergency
room
oh
yeah
eddie
looked
at
ben
doubtful
but
wanting
to
hope
you
got
a
nickel
i
got
a
dime
so
what
ben
eyed
the
drying
maroon
splotches
on
eddie
shirt
stop
at
the
store
and
get
a
chocolate
milk
pour
about
half
of
it
on
your
shirt
then
when
you
get
home
tell
your
mama
you
spilled
all
of
it
eddie
eyes
brightened
in
the
four
years
since
his
dad
had
died
his
mother
eyesight
had
worsened
considerably
for
reasons
of
vanity
and
because
she
didn't
know
how
to
drive
a
car
she
refused
to
see
an
optometrist
and
get
glasses
dried
bloodstains
and
chocolate
milk
stains
looked
about
the
same
maybe
that
might
work
he
said
just
don't
tell
her
it
was
my
idea
if
she
finds
out
won't
eddie
said
seeya
later
alligator
okay
n
eddie
said
patiently
when
i
say
that
you're
supposed
to
say
after
awhile
crocodile
oh
after
awhile
crocodile
you
got
it
eddie
smiled
you
know
something
ben
said
you
guys
are
really
cool
eddie
looked
more
than
embarrassed
he
looked
almost
nervous
bill
is
he
said
and
started
off
ben
watched
him
go
down
jackson
street
and
then
turned
toward
home
three
blocks
up
the
street
he
saw
three
alltoofamiliar
figures
standing
at
the
bus
stop
on
the
comer
of
jackson
and
main
they
were
mostly
turned
away
from
ben
which
was
damned
lucky
for
him
he
ducked
behind
a
hedge
his
heart
beating
hard
five
minutes
later
the
derry
newporthaven
interurban
bus
pulled
up
henry
and
his
friends
pitched
their
butts
into
the
street
and
swung
aboard
ben
waited
until
the
bus
was
out
of
sight
and
then
hurried
home
that
night
a
terrible
thing
happened
to
bill
denbrough
it
happened
for
the
second
time
his
mom
and
dad
were
downstairs
watching
tv
not
talking
much
sitting
at
either
end
of
the
couch
like
bookends
there
had
been
a
time
when
the
tv
room
opening
off
the
kitchen
would
have
been
full
of
tak
and
laughter
sometimes
so
much
of
both
you
couldn't
hear
the
tv
at
all
shut
up
georgie
bill
would
roar
stop
hogging
all
the
popcorn
and
i
will
george
would
return
ma
make
bill
give
me
the
popcorn
bill
give
him
the
popcorn
george
don't
call
me
ma
ma
a
sound
a
sheep
makes
or
his
dad
would
tell
a
joke
and
they
would
all
laugh
even
mom
george
didn't
always
get
the
jokes
bill
knew
but
he
laughed
because
everyone
else
was
laughing
in
those
days
his
mom
and
dad
had
also
been
bookends
on
the
couch
but
he
and
george
had
been
the
books
bill
had
tried
to
be
a
book
between
them
while
they
were
watching
tv
since
george
death
but
it
was
cold
work
they
sent
the
cold
out
from
both
directions
and
bill
defroster
was
simply
not
big
enough
to
cope
with
it
he
had
to
leave
because
that
kind
of
cold
always
froze
his
cheeks
and
made
his
eyes
water
w
want
to
lhear
a
joke
i
heard
today
in
ssschoo
he
had
tried
once
some
months
ago
silence
from
them
on
television
a
criminal
was
begging
his
brother
who
was
a
priest
to
hide
him
bills
dad
glanced
up
from
the
true
he
was
looking
at
and
glanced
at
bill
with
mild
surprise
then
he
looked
back
down
at
the
magazine
again
there
was
a
picture
of
a
hunter
sprawled
in
a
snowbank
and
staring
up
at
a
huge
snarling
polar
bear
mauled
by
the
killer
from
the
white
waste
was
the
name
of
the
article
bill
had
thought
i
know
where
there
some
white
wastes
right
between
my
dad
and
mom
on
this
couch
his
mother
had
never
looked
up
at
all
it
about
hhow
many
fffrenchmen
it
takes
to
sccherew
in
a
luhhhhightbulb
bill
plunged
ahead
he
felt
a
fine
mist
of
sweat
spring
out
upon
his
forehead
as
it
sometimes
did
in
school
when
he
knew
the
teacher
had
ignored
him
as
long
as
she
safely
could
and
must
soon
call
on
him
his
voice
was
too
loud
but
he
couldn't
seem
to
lower
it
the
words
echoed
in
his
head
like
crazy
chimes
echoing
jamming
up
spilling
out
again
dddo
you
know
hhhow
muhmuhman
one
to
hold
he
bulb
and
four
to
turn
the
house
zack
denbrough
said
absently
and
turned
the
page
of
his
magazine
did
you
say
something
dear
his
mother
asked
and
on
four
star
playhouse
the
brother
who
was
a
priest
told
the
brother
who
was
a
hoodlum
to
turn
himself
in
and
pray
for
forgiveness
bill
sat
there
sweating
but
cold
so
cold
it
was
cold
because
he
wasn't
really
the
only
book
between
those
two
ends
georgie
was
still
there
only
now
it
was
a
georgie
he
couldn't
see
a
georgie
who
never
demanded
the
popcorn
or
hollered
that
bill
was
pinching
this
new
version
of
george
never
cut
up
dickens
it
was
a
onearmed
georgie
who
was
palely
thoughtfully
silent
in
the
motorola
shadowy
whiteandblue
glow
and
perhaps
it
was
not
from
his
parents
but
from
george
that
the
big
chill
was
really
coming
perhaps
it
was
george
who
was
the
real
killer
from
the
white
wastes
finally
bill
had
fled
from
that
cold
invisible
brother
and
into
his
room
where
he
lay
face
down
on
his
bed
and
cried
into
his
pillow
george
room
was
just
as
it
had
been
on
the
day
he
died
zack
had
put
a
bunch
of
george
toys
into
a
canon
one
day
about
two
weeks
after
he
was
buried
meaning
them
for
the
goodwill
or
the
salvation
army
or
someplace
like
that
bill
supposed
sharon
denbrough
had
spotted
him
coming
out
with
the
box
in
his
arms
and
her
hands
had
flown
to
her
head
like
startled
white
birds
and
plunged
themselves
deep
into
her
hair
where
they
locked
themselves
into
pulling
fists
bill
had
seen
this
and
had
fallen
against
the
wall
the
strength
suddenly
running
out
of
his
legs
his
mother
looked
as
mad
as
elsa
lanchester
in
the
bride
of
frankenstein
don't
you
dare
take
his
things
she
had
screeched
zack
flinched
and
then
took
the
box
of
toys
back
into
george
room
without
a
word
he
even
put
them
back
in
exactly
the
same
places
from
which
he
had
taken
them
bill
came
in
and
saw
his
father
kneeling
by
george
bed
which
his
mother
still
changed
although
only
once
a
week
now
instead
of
twice
with
his
head
on
his
lairy
muscular
forearms
bill
saw
his
father
was
crying
and
this
increased
his
terror
a
frightening
possibility
suddenly
occurred
to
him
maybe
sometimes
things
didn't
just
go
wrong
and
then
stop
maybe
sometimes
they
just
kept
going
wronger
and
wronger
until
everything
was
totally
fucked
up
dduhdad
go
on
bill
his
father
said
his
voice
was
muffled
and
shaking
his
back
went
up
and
down
bill
badly
wanted
to
touch
his
father
back
to
see
if
perhaps
his
hand
might
be
able
to
still
that
restless
heaving
he
did
not
quite
dare
go
on
buzz
off
he
left
and
went
creeping
along
the
upstairs
hall
hearing
his
mother
doing
her
own
crying
down
in
the
kitchen
the
sound
was
shrill
and
helpless
bill
thought
why
are
they
crying
so
far
apart
and
then
he
shoved
the
thought
away
on
the
first
night
of
summer
vacation
bill
went
into
georgie
room
his
heart
was
beating
heavily
in
his
chest
and
his
legs
felt
stiff
and
awkward
with
tension
he
came
to
george
room
often
but
that
didn't
mean
he
liked
it
in
here
the
room
was
so
full
of
george
presence
that
it
felt
haunted
he
came
in
and
couldn't
help
thinking
that
the
closet
door
might
creak
open
at
any
moment
and
there
would
be
georgie
among
the
shirts
and
pants
still
neatly
hung
in
there
a
georgie
dressed
in
a
rainslicker
covered
with
red
splotches
and
streaks
a
rainslicker
with
one
dangling
yellow
arm
george
eyes
would
be
blank
and
terrible
the
eyes
of
a
zombie
in
a
horror
movie
when
he
came
out
of
the
closet
his
galoshes
would
make
squishy
sounds
as
he
walked
across
the
room
toward
where
bill
sat
on
his
bed
a
frozen
block
of
terror
if
the
power
had
gone
out
some
evening
while
he
sat
here
on
george
bed
looking
at
the
pictures
on
george
wall
or
the
models
on
top
of
george
dresser
he
felt
sure
a
heart
attack
probably
fatal
would
ensue
in
the
next
ten
seconds
or
so
but
he
went
anyway
warring
with
his
terror
of
georgethe
ghost
was
a
mute
and
grasping
need
a
hunger
to
somehow
get
over
george
death
and
find
a
decent
way
to
go
on
not
to
forget
george
but
somehow
to
find
a
way
to
make
him
not
so
fucking
gruesome
he
understood
that
his
parents
were
not
succeeding
very
well
with
that
and
if
he
was
going
to
do
it
for
himself
he
would
have
to
do
it
by
himself
nor
was
it
just
for
himself
that
he
came
he
came
for
georgie
as
well
he
had
loved
george
and
for
brothers
they
had
gotten
along
pretty
well
oh
they
had
their
pissy
moments
bill
giving
george
a
good
old
indian
ropebum
george
tattling
on
bill
when
bill
snuck
downstairs
after
lightsout
and
ate
the
rest
of
the
lemoncream
frosting
but
mostly
they
got
along
bad
enough
that
george
should
be
dead
for
him
to
turn
george
into
some
kind
of
horrormonster
that
was
even
worse
he
missed
the
little
kid
that
was
the
truth
missed
his
voice
his
laughter
missed
the
way
george
eyes
sometimes
tipped
confidently
up
to
his
own
sure
that
bill
would
have
whatever
answers
were
required
and
one
surpassingly
odd
thing
there
were
times
when
he
felt
he
loved
george
best
in
his
fear
because
even
in
his
fear
his
uneasy
feelings
that
a
zombiegeorge
might
be
lurking
in
the
closet
or
under
the
bed
he
could
remember
loving
george
better
in
here
and
george
loving
him
in
his
effort
to
reconcile
these
two
emotions
his
love
and
his
terror
bill
felt
that
he
was
closest
to
finding
where
final
acceptance
lay
these
were
not
things
of
which
he
could
have
spoken
to
his
mind
the
ideas
were
nothing
but
an
incoherent
jumble
but
his
warm
and
desiring
heart
understood
and
that
was
all
that
mattered
sometimes
he
looked
through
george
books
sometimes
he
sifted
through
george
toys
he
hadn't
looked
in
george
photograph
album
since
last
december
now
on
the
night
after
meeting
ben
hanscom
bill
opened
the
door
of
george
closet
steeling
himself
as
always
to
meet
the
sight
of
georgie
himself
standing
in
his
bloody
slicker
amid
the
hanging
clothes
expecting
as
always
to
see
one
pallid
fishfingered
hand
come
pistoning
out
of
the
dark
to
grip
his
arm
and
took
the
album
down
from
the
top
shelf
my
photographs
the
gold
script
on
the
front
read
below
scotchtaped
on
the
tape
was
now
slightly
yellow
and
peeling
the
carefully
printed
words
george
elmer
denbrough
age
bill
took
it
back
to
the
bed
georgie
had
slept
in
his
heart
beating
heavier
than
ever
he
couldn't
tell
what
had
made
him
get
the
photograph
album
down
again
after
what
had
happened
in
december
a
second
look
that
all
just
to
convince
yourself
that
it
wasn't
real
the
first
time
that
the
first
time
was
just
your
head
playing
a
trick
on
itself
well
it
was
an
idea
anyway
it
might
even
be
true
but
bill
suspected
it
was
just
the
album
itself
it
held
a
certain
mad
fascination
for
him
whathe
had
seen
or
what
he
thought
he
had
seen
he
opened
the
album
now
it
was
filled
with
pictures
george
had
gotten
his
mother
father
aunts
and
uncles
to
give
him
george
didn't
care
if
they
were
pictures
of
people
and
places
he
knew
or
not
it
vas
the
idea
of
photography
itself
which
fascinated
him
when
he
had
been
unsuccessful
at
pestering
anyone
into
giving
him
new
photos
to
mount
he
would
sit
cross
legged
on
his
bed
where
bill
was
sitting
now
and
look
at
the
old
ones
turning
the
pages
carefully
studying
the
blackandwhite
kodaks
here
was
their
mother
when
she
was
young
and
impossibly
gorgeous
here
their
father
no
more
than
eighteen
one
of
a
trio
of
smiling
rifletoting
young
men
standing
over
the

on
some
rocks
and
holding
up
a

kneeling
proudly
beside
a
basket
of
tomatoes
she
had
raised
an
old
buick

a

a
house
a
road
that
went
from
somewhere
to
somewhere
all
these
pictures
snapped
by
lost
somebodies
for
lost
reasons
locked
up
here
in
a
dead
boy
album
of
photographs
here
bill
saw
himself
at
three
propped
up
in
a
hospital
bed
with
a
turban
of
bandages
covering
his
hair
bandages
went
down
his
cheeks
and
under
his
fractured
jaw
he
had
been
struck
by
a
car
in
the
parking
lot
of
the
a&ampp
on
center
street
he
remembered
very
little
of
his
hospital
stay
only
that
they
had
given
him
icecream
milk
shakes
through
a
straw
and
his
head
had
ached
dreadfully
for
three
days
here
was
the
whole
family
on
the
lawn
of
the
house
bill
standing
by
his
mother
and
holding
her
hand
and
george
only
a
baby
sleeping
in
zack
arms
and
here
it
wasn't
the
end
of
the
book
but
it
was
the
last
page
that
mattered
because
the
following
ones
were
all
blank
the
final
picture
was
george
school
picture
taken
in
october
of
last
year
less
than
ten
days
before
he
died
in
it
george
was
wearing
a
crewneck
shirt
his
fly
away
hair
was
slicked
down
with
water
he
was
grinning
revealing
two
empty
slots
in
which
new
teeth
would
never
grow
unless
they
keep
on
growing
after
you
die
bill
thought
and
shuddered
he
looked
at
the
picture
fixedly
for
some
time
and
was
about
to
close
the
book
when
what
had
happened
in
december
happened
again
george
eyes
rolled
in
the
picture
they
turned
up
to
meet
bill
own
george
artificial
saycheese
smile
turned
into
a
horrid
leer
his
right
eye
drooped
closed
in
a
wink
see
you
soon
bill
in
my
closet
maybe
tonight
bill
threw
the
book
across
the
room
he
clapped
his
hands
over
his
mouth
the
book
struck
the
wall
and
fell
to
the
floor
open
the
pages
turned
although
there
was
no
draft
the
book
opened
itself
to
that
awful
picture
again
the
picture
which
said
school
friends
beneath
it
blood
began
to
flow
from
the
picture
bill
sat
frozen
his
tongue
a
swelling
choking
lump
in
his
mouth
his
skin
crawling
his
hair
lifting
he
wanted
to
scream
but
the
tiny
whimpering
sounds
crawling
out
of
his
throat
seemed
to
be
the
best
he
could
manage
the
blood
flowed
across
the

and
began
to

onto

prompts
new
fears
edward

of
charter
street
derry
was
reported
missing
last
night
by
his
mother
monica
macklin
and
his
stepfather
richard
p
macklin
the
corcoran
boy
is
ten
his
disappearance
has
prompted
new
fears
that
derry
young
people
are
being
stalked
by
a
killer
mrs
macklin
said
the
boy
had
been
missing
since
june
th
when
he
failed
to
return
home
from
school
after
the
last
day
of
classes
before
summer
vacation
when
asked
why
they
had
delayed
over
twentyfour
hours
before
reporting
their
son
absence
mr
and
mrs
macklin
refused
comment
police
chief
richard
borton
also
declined
comment
but
a
police
department
source
told
the
news
that
the
corcoran
boy
relationship
with
his
stepfather
was
not
a
good
one
and
that
he
had
spent
nights
out
of
the
house
before
the
source
speculated
that
the
boy
final
grades
may
have
played
a
part
in
the
boy
failure
to
tum
up
derry
school
superintendent
harold
metcalf
declined
comment
on
the
corcoran
boy
grades
pointing
out
they
are
not
a
matter
of
public
record
i
hope
the
disappearance
of
this
boy
will
not
cause
unnecessary
fears
chief
borton
said
last
night
the
mood
of
the
community
is
understandably
uneasy
but
i
want
to
emphasize
that
we
log
thirty
to
fifty
missingpersons
reports
on
minors
each
and
every
year
most
turn
up
alive
and
well
within
a
week
of
the
initial
report
this
will
be
the
case
with
edward
corcoran
god
willing
borton
also
reiterated
his
conviction
that
the
murders
of
george
denbrough
betty
ripsom
cheryl
lamonica
matthew
clements
and
veronica
grogan
were
not
the
work
of
one
person
there
are
essential
differences
in
each
crime
borton
said
but
declined
to
elaborate
he
said
that
local
police
working
in
close
cooperation
with
the
maine

general

good
these

are
chief
borton
replied
very
good

macklin
arrested
in
beating
death
under
suspicion
in
unsolved
disappearance
chief
richard
borton
of
the
derry
police
called
a
news
conference
yesterday
to
announce
that
richard
p
macklin
of
charter
street
had
been
arrested
and
charged
with
the
murder
of
his
stepson
dorsey
corcoran
the
corcoran
boy
died
in
derry
home
hospital
of
reported
accidental
causes
on
may
st
of
last
year
the
medical
examiner
report
shows
that
the
boy
was
badly
beaten
borton
said
although
macklin
claimed
the
boy
had
fallen
from
a
stepladder
while
playing
in
the
garage
borton
said
the
county
medical
examiner
report
showed
that
dorsey
corcoran
was
severely
beaten
with
some
blunt
instrument
when
asked
what
sort
of
instrument
borton
said
it
might
have
been
a
hammer
right
now
the
important
thing
is
the
medical
examiner
conclusion
that
this
boy
was
struck
repeated
blows
with
some
object
hard
enough
to
break
his
bones
the
wounds
particularly
those
in
the
skull
are
not
at
all
consistent
with
those
which
might
be
incurred
in
a
fall
dorsey
corcoran
was
beaten
within
an
inch
of
his
life
and
then
dumped
off
at
the
home
hospital
emergency
room
to
die
asked
if
the
doctors
who
treated
the
corcoran
boy
might
have
been
derelict
n
their
duty
when
it
came
to
reporting
either
an
incidence
of
child
abuse
or
the
actual
cause
of
death
borton
said
they
will
have
serious
questions
to
answer
when
mr
macklin
comes
to
trial
asked
for
an
opinion
on
how
these
developments
might
bear
on
the
recent
disappearance
of
dorsey
corcoran
older
brother
edward
reported
missing
by
richard
and
monica
macklin
four
days

i've
seen
such
a
thing
as
this
in
my
career
as
a
teacher
the
first
few
times
i
had
a
student
with
a
parent
who
was
confusing
beatings
with
discipline
i
tried
to
do
something
about
it
i
was
told
by
the
assistant
principal
gwendolyn
rayburn
in
those
days
to
stay
out
of
it
she
told
me
that
when
school
employees
get
involved
in
cases
of
suspected
child
abuse
it
always
comes
back
to
haunt
the
school
department
at
tax
appropriation
tune
i
went
to
the
principal
and
he
told
me
to
forget
it
or
i
would
be
reprimanded
i
asked
him
if
a
reprimand
in
a
matter
like
that
would
go
on
my
record
he
said
a
reprimand
did
not
have
to
be
on
a
teacher
record
i
got
the
message
asked
if
the
attitude
in
the
derry
school
system
remained
the
same
now
mrs
dumont
said
well
what
does
it
look
like
in
light
of
this
current
situation
and
i
might
add
that
i
would
not
be
speaking
to
you
now
if
i
hadn't
retired
at
the
end
of
this
school
year
mrs
dumont
went
on
since
this
thing
came
out
i
get
down
on
my
knees
every
night
and
pray
that
eddie
corcoran
just
got
fed
up
with
that
beast
of
a
stepfather
and
ran
away
i
pray
that
when
he
reads
in
the
paper
or
hears
on
the
news
that
macklin
has
been
locked
up
eddie
will
come
hom
in
a
brief
telephone
interview
monica
macklin
hotly
refuted
mrs
dumont
charges
rich
never
beat
dorsey
and
he
never
beat
eddie
either
she
said
t'm
telling
you
that
right
now
and
when
i
die
i'll
stand
at
the
throne
of
judgment
and
look
god
right
in
the
eye
and
tell
him
the
same
thing

daddy
had
to
take
me
up
cause
i'm
bad
tot
told
nursery
teacher
before
beating
death
a
local
nurseryschool
teacher
who
declined
to
be
identified
told
a
news
reporter
yesterday
that
young
dorsey
corcoran
came
to
his
twiceweekly
nurseryschool
class
with
bad
sprains
of
his
right
thumb
and
three
fingers
of
his
right
hand
less
than
a
week
before
his
death
in
a
purported
garage
accident
tt
was
hurting
him
enough
so
that
the
poor
little
guy
couldn't
color
his
mr
do
safety
poster
the
teacher
said
the
fingers
were
swelled
up
like
sausages
when
i
asked
dorsey
what
happened
he
said
that
his
father
stepfather
richard
p
macklin
had
bent
his
fingers
back
because
he
had
walked
across
a
floor
his
mother
had
just
washed
and
waxed
daddy
had
to
take
me
up
cause
i'm
bad
was
the
way
he
put
it
i
felt
like
crying
looking
at
his
poor
dear
fingers
he
really
wanted
to
color
his
poster
like
the
other
children
so
i
gave
him
some
baby
aspirin
and
let
him
color
while
the
others
were
having
story
time
he
loved
to
color
the
mr
do
posters
that
was
what
he
liked
best
and
now
i'm
so
glad
i
was
able
to
help
him
have
a
little
happiness
that
day
when
he
died
it
never
crossed
my
mind
to
think
it
was
anything
but
an
accident
i
guess
at
first
i
thought
he
must
have
fallen
because
he
couldn't
grip
very
well
with
that
hand
now
i
think
i
just
couldn't
believe
an
adult
could
do
such
a
thing
to
a
little
person
i
know
better
now
i
wish
to
god

i

i

climbing

again
and
i
grabbed
the
hammer
from
the
bench
where
it
was
laying
and
i
just
started
to
use
it
on
him
i
didn't
mean
to
kill
him
with

as

i
never
meant

he

no

his

for

really
don't

so
says

ashley

who
serves

at

macklin
began
taking
instruction
in
the
catholic
faith
shortly
after

his
prison

and
father
o'brian
has
spent
a
good
deal
of

with
him
he
is
sincerely
sorry
for
what
he
has
done
father
o'brian
goes
on
adding
that
when
he
initially
asked
macklin
why
he
wanted
to
be
a
catholic
macklin
replied
i
hear
they
have
an
act
of
contrition
and
i
need
to
do
a
lot
of
that
or
else
i'll
go
to
hell
when
i
die
he
knows
what
he
did
to
the
younger
boy
father
o'brian
said
if
he
also
did
something
to
the
older
one
he
doesn't
remember
it
as
far
as
edward
goes
he
believes
his
hands
are
clean
how
clean
macklin
hands
are
in
the
matter
of
his
stepson
edward
is
a
question
which
continues
to
trouble
derry
residents
but
he
has
been
convincingly
cleared
of
the
other
childmurders
which
have
taken
place
here
he
was
able
to
produce
ironclad
alibis
for
the
first
three
and
he
was
in
jail
when
seven
others
were
committed
in
late
june
july
and
august
all
ten
murders
remain
unsolved
in
an
exclusive
interview
with
the

last

macklin
again
asserted
that
he
knows
nothing
of
edward
corcoran
whereabouts
i
beat
them
both
he
said
in
a
painful
monologue
which
was
often
halted
by
bouts
of
weeping
i
loved
them
but
i
beat
them
i
don't
know
why
any
more
than
i
know
why
monica
let
me
or
why
she
covered
up
for
me
after
dorsey
died
i
guess
i
could
have
killed
eddie
as
easy
as
i
did
dorsey
but
i
swear
before
god
and
jesus
and
all
the
saints
of
heaven
that
i
didn't
i
know
how
it
looks
but
i
didn't
do
it
i
think
he
just
ran
away
if
he
did
that
one
thing
i've
got
to
thank
god
for
asked
if
he
is
aware
of
any
gaps
in
his
memory
if
he
could
have
killed
edward
and
then
blocked
it
out
of
his
mind
macklin
replied
i
ain't
aware
of
any
gaps
i
know
only
too
well
what
i
did
i've
given
my
life
to
christ

i'm

all
right
he
died
on
the
night
of
june
th
and
his
stepfather
had
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
it
he
died
as
ben
hanscom
sat
home
watching
tv
with
his
mother
as
eddie
kaspbrak
mother
anxiously
felt
eddie
forehead
for
signs
of
her
favorite
ailment
phantom
fever
as
beverly
marsh
stepfather
a
gent
who
bore
in
temperament
at

a
remarkable
resemblance
to

and
dorsey
corcoran
stepfather
lifted
a
highstepping
kick
into
the
girl
derriere
and
told
her
to
get
out
there
and
dry

dishes
like
your

out
on

road
not
far
from
the
farm
owned
by
henry
bowers
crazy
father
as
richie
tozier
was
sneaking
a
look
at
the
half
undressed
girls
in
a
copy
of
gem
he
had
found
at
the
bottom
of
his
father
socksandunderwear
drawer
and
getting
a
regular
good
boner
and
as
bill
denbrough
was
throwing
his
dead
brother
photograph
album
across
the
room
in
horrified
unbelief
although
none
of
them
would
remember
doing
so
later
all
of
them
looked
up
at
the
exact
moment
eddie
corcoran
died
as
if
hearing
some
distant
cry
the
news
had
been
absolutely
right
about
one
thing
eddie
rankcard
was
just
bad
enough
to
make
him
afraid
to
go
home
and
face
his
stepdad
also
his
mother
and
the
old
man
were
fighting
a
lot
this
month
that
made
things
even
worse
when
they
got
going
at
it
hot
and
heavy
his
mother
shouted
a
lot
of
mostly
incoherent
accusations
his
stepdad
responded
to
these
first
with
grunts
then
yells
to
shut
up
and
finally
with
the
enraged
bellows
of
a
boar
which
has
gotten
a
quiver
of
porcupine
needles
in
its
snout
eddie
had
never
seen
the
old
man
use
his
fists
on
her
though
eddie
didn't
think
he
quite
dared
he
had
saved
his
fists
for
eddie
and
dorsey
in
the
old
days
and
now
that
dorsey
was
dead
eddie
got
his
little
brother
share
as
well
as
his
own
these
shouting
matches
came
and
went
in
cycles
they
were
most
common
at
the
end
of
the
month
when
the
bills
came
in
a
policeman
called
by
a
neighbor
might
drop
by
once
or
twice
when
things
were
at
their
worst
and
tell
them
to
tone
it
down
usually
that
ended
it
his
mother
was
apt
to
give
the
cop
the
finger
and
dare
him
to
take
her
in
but
his
stepdad
rarely
said
boo
his
stepdad
was
afraid
of
the
cops
eddie
thought
he
lay
low
during
these
periods
of
stress
it
was
wiser
if
you
didn't
think
so
just
look
at
what
had
happened
to
dorsey
eddie
didn't
know
the
specifics
and
didn't
want
to
but
he
had
an
idea
about
dorsey
he
thought
that
dorsey
had
been
in
the
wrong
place
at
the
wrong
time
the
garage
on
the
last
day
of
the
month
they
told
eddie
that
dorsey
fel
off
the
stepladder
in
the
garage
if
i
told
him
once
to
stay
off
n
it
i
told
him
sixty
times
his
stepdad
had
said
but
his
mother
wouldn't
look
at
him
except
by
accident
and
when
their
eyes
did
meet
eddie
had
seen
a
frightened
ratty
little
gleam
in
hers
that
he
didn't
like
the
old
man
just
sat
there
silently
at
the
kitchen
table
with
a
quart
of
rheingold
looking
at
nothing
from
beneath
his
heavy
lowering
eyebrows
eddie
kept
out
of
his
reach
when
his
stepfather
was
bellowing
he
was
usually
not
always
but
usually
all
right
it
was
when
he
stopped
that
you
had
to
be
careful
two
nights
ago
he
had
thrown
a
chair
at
eddie
when
eddie
got
up
to
see
what
was
on
the
other
tv
channel
just
picked
up
one
of
the
tubular
aluminum
kitchen
chairs
swept
it
back
over
his
head
and
let
fly
it
hit
eddie
in
the
butt
and
knocked
him
over
his
butt
still
ached
but
he
knew
it
could
have
been
worse
it
could
have
been
his
head
then
there
had
been
the
night
when
the
old
man
had
suddenly
gotten
up
and
rubbed
a
handful
of
mashed
potatoes
into
eddie
hair
for
no
reason
at
all
one
day
last
september
eddie
had
come
in
from
school
and
foolishly
allowed
the
screen
door
to
slam
shut
behind
him
while
his
stepdad
was
taking
a
nap
macklin
came
out
of
he
bedroom
in
his
billowy
boxer
shorts
hair
standing
up
in
corkscrews
cheeks
grizzled
with
two
days
of
weekend
beard
breath
grizzled
with
two
days
of
weekend
beer
there
now
eddie
he
said
i
got
to
take
you
up
for
slammin
that
fuckin
door
in
rich
macklin
lexicon
taking
you
u
was
a
euphemism
for
beating
the
shit
out
of
you
which
was
what
he
then
did
to
eddie
eddie
had
lost
consciousness
when
the
old
man
threw
him
into
the
front
hall
his
mother
had
mounted
a
pair
of
low
coathooks
out
there
especially
for
him
and
dorsey
to
hang
their
coats
on
these
hooks
had
rammed
hard
steel
fingers
into
eddie
lower
back
and
that
was
when
he
passed
out
when
he
came
to
ten
minutes
later
he
heard
his
mother
yelling
that
she
was
going
to
take
eddie
to
the
hospital
and
he
couldn't
stop
her
after
what
happened
to
dorsey
his
stepdad
had
responded
you
want
to
go
to
jail
woman
that
was
the
end
of
her
talk
about
the
hospital
she
helped
eddie
in
to
his
room
where
he
lay
shivering
on
his
bed
his
forehead
beaded
with
sweat
the
only
time
he
left
the
room
during
the
next
three
days
was
when
they
were
both
gone
then
he
would
hobble
slowly
into
the
kitchen
groaning
softly
and
get
his
stepdad
whiskey
from
under
the
sink
a
few
nips
dulled
the
pain
the
pain
was
mostly
gone
by
the
fifth
day
but
he
had
pissed
blood
for
almost
two
weeks
and
the
hammer
wasn't
in
the
garage
anymore
what
about
that
what
about
that
friends
and
neighbors
oh
the
craftsman
hammer
the
ordinary
hammer
was
still
there
it
was
the
scotti
recoilless
which
was
missing
his
stepdad
special
hammer
the
one
he
and
dorsey
had
been
forbidden
to
touch
if
one
of
you
touches
that
baby
he
had
told
them
the
day
he
bought
it
you'll
both
be
wearing
your
guts
for
earmuffs
dorsey
had
asked
timidly
if
that
hammer
was
very
expensive
the
old
man
told
him
he
was
damn
tooting
he
said
it
was
filled
with
ball
bearings
and
you
couldn't
make
it
bounce
back
up
no
matter
how
hard
you
brought
it
down
now
it
was
gone
eddie
grades
weren't
the
best
because
he
had
missed
a
lot
of
school
since
his
mother
remarriage
but
he
was
not
a
stupid
boy
by
any
means
he
thought
he
knew
what
had
happened
to
the
scotti
recoilless
hammer
he
thought
maybe
his
stepfather
had
used
it
on
dorsey
and
then
buried
it
in
the
garden
or
maybe
thrown
it
in
the
canal
it
was
the
sort
of
thing
that
happened
frequently
in
the
horror
comics
eddie
read
the
ones
he
kept
on
the
top
shelf
of
his
closet
he
walked
closer
to
the
canal
which
rippled
between
its
concrete
sides
like
oiled
silk
a
swatch
of
moonlight
glimmered
across
its
dark
surface
in
a
boomerang
shape
he
sat
down
swinging
his
sneakers
idly
against
the
concrete
in
an
irregular
tattoo
the
last
six
weeks
had
been
quite
dry
and
the
water
flowed
past
perhaps
nine
feet
below
the
worn
soles
of
his
sneakers
but
if
you
looked
closely
at
the
canal
sides
you
could
read
the
various
levels
to
which
it
sometimes
rose
quite
easily
the
concrete
was
stained
a
dark
brown
just
above
the
water
current
level
this
brown
stain
slowly
faded
to
yellow
then
to
a
color
that
was
almost
white
at
the
level
where
the
heels
of
eddie
sneakers
made
contact
when
he
swung
them
the
water
flowed
smoothly
and
silently
out
of
a
concrete
arch
that
was
cobbled
on
the
inside
past
the
place
where
eddie
sat
and
then
down
to
the
covered
wooden
footbridge
between
bassey
park
and
derry
high
school
the
bridge
sides
and
plank
footing
even
the
beams
under
the
roof
were
covered
with
an
intaglio
of
initials
phone
numbers
and
declarations
declarations
of
love
declarations
that
soandso
was
willing
to
suc
or
blow
declarations
that
those
discovered
sucking
or
blowing
would
lose
their
foreskins
or
have
their
assholes
plugged
with
hot
tar
occasioml
eccentric
declarations
that
defied
definition
one
that
eddie
had
puzzled
over
all
this
spring
read
save
russian
jews
collect
valuable
prizes
what
exactly
did
that
mean
anything
and
did
it
matter
eddie
didn't
go
into
the
kissing
bridge
tonight
he
had
no
urge
to
cross
over
to
the
high
school
side
he
thought
he
would
probably
sleep
in
the
park
maybe
in
the
dead
leaves
under
the
bandstand
but
for
now
it
was
fine
just
to
sit
here
he
liked
it
in
the
park
and
came
often
when
he
had
to
think
sometimes
there
were
people
making
out
in
the
groves
of
trees
which
dotted
the
park
but
eddie
left
them
alone
and
they
left
him
alone
he
had
heard
lurid
stories
in
the
playground
at
school
about
the
queers
that
cruised
in
bassey
park
after
sundown
and
he
accepted
these
stories
without
question
but
he
himself
had
never
been
bothered
the
park
was
a
peaceful
place
and
he
thought
the
best
part
of
it
was
right
here
where
he
was
sitting
he
liked
it
in
the
middle
of
summer
when
the
water
was
so
low
it
chuckled
over
the
stones
and
actually
broke
up
into
isolated
streamlets
that
twisted
and
turned
and
sometimes
came
together
again
he
liked
it
in
late
march
or
early
april
just
after
iceout
when
he
would
sometimes
stand
by
the
canal
too
cold
to
sit
then
your
ass
would
freeze
for
an
hour
or
more
the
hood
of
his
old
parka
now
two
years
too
small
for
him
pulled
up
his
hands
plunged
into
his
pockets
unaware
that
his
skinny
body
was
shivering
and
shaking
the
canal
had
a
terrible
irresistible
power
in
the
week
or
two
after
the
ice
went
out
he
was
fascinated
by
the
way
the
water
boiled
whitely
out
of
the
cobbled
arch
and
roared
past
him
bearing
sticks
and
branches
and
all
manner
of
human
trash
along
with
it
more
than
once
he
had
envisioned
walking
beside
the
canal
in
march
with
his
stepdad
and
giving
the
bastard
a
great
big
motherfucking
push
he
would
scream
and
fall
in
his
arms
pinwheeling
for
balance
and
eddie
would
stand
on
the
concrete
parapet
and
watch
him
carried
off
downstream
his
head
a
black
bobbing
shape
in
the
middle
of
the
unruly
whitecapped
current
he
would
stand
there
yes
and
he
would
cup
his
hands
around
his
mouth
and
scream
that
was
for
dorsey
you
rotten
cocksucker
when
you
get
down
to
hell
tell
the
devil
the
last
thing
you
ever
heard
was
me
telling
you
to
pick
on
somebody
your
own
size
it
would
never
happen
of
course
but
it
was
an
absolutely
grand
fantasy
a
grand
dream
to
dream
as
you
sat
here
by
the
canal
a
g
a
hand
closed
around
eddie
foot
he
had
been
looking
across
the
canal
toward
the
school
smiling
a
sleepy
and
rather
beautiful
smile
as
he
imagined
his
stepfather
being
carried
off
in
the
violent
rip
of
the
spring
runoff
being
carried
out
of
his
life
forever
the
soft
yet
strong
grip
startled
him
so
much
that
he
almost
lost
his
balance
and
tumbled
into
the
canal
its
one
of
the
queers
the
big
kids
are
always
talking
about
he
thought
and
then
he
looked
down
his
mouth
dropped
open
urine
spilled
hotly
down
his
legs
and
stained
his
jeans
black
in
the
moonlight
it
wasn't
a
queer
it
was
dorsey
it
was
dorsey
as
he
had
been
buried
dorsey
in
his
blue
blazer
and
gray
pants
only
now
the
blazer
was
in
muddy
tatters
dorsey
shirt
was
yellow
rags
dorsey
pants
clung
wetly
to
legs
as
thin
as
broomsticks
and
dorsey
head
was
horribly
slumped
as
if
it
had
been
caved
in
at
the
back
and
consequently
pushed
up
in
the
front
dorsey
was
grinning
eddieeee
his
dead
brother
croaked
just
like
one
of
the
dead
people
who
were
always
coming
back
from
the
grave
in
the
horror
comics
dorsey
grin
widened
yellow
teeth
gleamed
and
somewhere
way
back
in
that
darkness
things
seemed
to
be
squirming
eddieeee
i
came
to
see
you
eddieeeeee
eddie
tried
to
scream
waves
of
gray
shock
rolled
over
him
and
he
had
the
curious
sensation
that
he
was
floating
but
it
was
not
a
dream
he
was
awake
the
hand
on
his
sneaker
was
as
white
as
a
trout
belly
his
brother
bare
feet
clung
somehow
to
the
concrete
something
had
bitten
one
of
dorsey
heels
off
come
on
down
eddieeeee
eddie
couldn't
scream
his
lungs
didn't
have
enough
ah
in
them
to
manage
a
scream
he
got
out
a
curious
reedy
moaning
sound
anything
louder
seemed
beyond
him
that
was
all
right
in
a
second
or
two
his
mind
would
snap
and
after
that
nothing
would
matter
dorsey
hand
was
small
but
implacable
eddie
buttocks
were
sliding
over
the
concrete
to
the
edge
of
the
canal
still
making
that
reedy
moaning
sound
he
reached
behind
himself
and
grabbed
the
concrete
edging
and
yanked
himself
backward
he
felt
the
hand
slide
away
momentarily
heard
an
angry
hiss
and
had
time
to
think
that
not
dorsey
i
don't
know
what
it
is
but
it
not
dorsey
then
adrenaline
flooded
his
body
and
he
was
crawling
away
trying
to
run
even
before
he
was
on
his
feet
his
breath
coming
in
short
shrieky
whistles
white
hands
appeared
on
the
concrete
lip
of
the
canal
there
was
a
wet
slapping
sound
drops
of
water
flew
upward
in
the
moonlight
from
dead
pallid
skin
now
dorsey
face
appeared
over
the
edge
dim
red
sparks
gleamed
in
his
sunken
eyes
his
wet
hair
was
plastered
to
his
skull
mud
streaked
his
cheeks
like
warpaint
eddie
chest
finally
unlocked
he
hitched
in
breath
and
turned
it
into
a
scream
he
got
to
his
feet
and
ran
he
ran
looking
back
over
his
shoulder
needing
to
see
where
dorsey
was
and
as
a
result
he
ran
smack
into
a
large
elm
tree
it
felt
as
if
someone
his
old
man
for
instance
had
set
off
a
dynamite
charge
in
his
left
shoulder
stars
shot
and
corkscrewed
through
his
head
he
fell
at
the
base
of
the
tree
as
if
poleaxed
blood
trickling
from
his
left
temple
he
swam
in
the
waters
of
semiconsciousness
for
perhaps
ninety
seconds
then
he
managed
to
gain
his
feet
again
a
groan
escaped
him
as
he
tried
to
raise
his
left
arm
it
didn't
want
to
come
felt
all
numb
and
far
away
so
he
raised
his
right
and
rubbed
his
fiercely
aching
head
then
he
remembered
why
he
had
happened
to
run
fulltilt
into
the
elm
tree
in
the
first
place
and
looked
around
there
was
the
edge
of
the
canal
white
as
bone
and
straight
as
string
in
the
moonlight
no
sign
of
the
thing
from
the
canal
if
there
ever
had
been
a
thing
he
continued
turning
working
his
way
slowly
through
a
complete
three
hundred
and
sixty
degrees
bassey
park
was
silent
and
as
still
as
a
blackandwhite
photograph
weeping
willows
draggled
their
thin
tenebrous
arms
and
anything
could
be
standing
slumped
and
insane
within
their
shelter
eddie
began
to
walk
trying
to
look
everywhere
at
once
his
sprained
shoulder
throbbed
in
painful
sync
with
his
heartbeat
eddieeeee
the
breeze
moaned
through
the
trees
don't
you
want
to
see
meeeee
eddieeeee
he
felt
flabby
corpsefingers
caress
the
side
of
his
neck
he
whirled
his
hands
going
up
as
his
feet
tangled
together
and
he
fell
he
saw
that
it
had
only
been
willowfronds
moving
in
the
breeze
he
got
up
again
he
wanted
to
run
but
when
he
tried
another
dynamite
charge
went
off
in
his
shoulder
and
he
had
to
stop
he
knew
somehow
that
he
should
be
getting
over
his
fright
by
now
calling
himself
a
stupid
little
baby
who
got
spooked
by
a
reflection
or
maybe
fell
asleep
without
knowing
it
and
had
a
bad
dream
that
wasn't
happening
though
quite
the
reverse
in
fact
his
heart
was
now
beating
so
fast
he
could
no
longer
distinguish
the
separate
thuds
and
he
felt
sure
it
would
soon
burst
in
terror
he
couldn't
run
but
when
he
got
out
of
the
willows
he
did
manage
a
limping
jogtrot
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
streetlight
that
marked
the
park
main
gate
he
headed
in
that
direction
managing
a
little
more
speed
thinking
th
make
it
to
the
light
and
that
all
right
i'll
make
it
to
the
light
and
that
all
right
bright
light
no
more
fright
up
all
night
what
a
sight
something
was
following
him
eddie
could
hear
it
bludgeoning
its
way
through
the
willow
grove
if
he
turned
he
would
see
it
it
was
gaining
he
could
hear
its
feet
a
kind
of
shuffling
squelching
stride
but
he
would
not
look
back
no
he
would
look
ahead
at
the
light
the
light
was
all
right
he
would
just
continue
his
flight
to
the
light
and
he
was
almost
there
almost
the
smell
was
what
made
him
look
back
the
overwhelming
smell
as
if
fish
had
been
left
to
rot
in
a
huge
pile
that
had
become
carrionslushy
in
the
summer
heat
it
was
the
smell
of
a
dead
ocean
it
wasn't
dorsey
after
him
now
it
was
the
creature
from
the
black
lagoon
the
thing
snout
was
long
and
pleated
green
fluid
dripped
from
black
gashes
like
vertical
mouths
in
its
cheeks
its
eyes
were
white
and
jellylike
its
webbed
fingers
were
tipped
with
claws
like
razors
its
respiration
was
bubbly
and
deep
the
sound
of
a
diver
with
a
bad
regulator
as
it
saw
eddie
looking
its
greenblack
lips
wrinkled
back
from
huge
fangs
in
a
dead
and
vacant
smile
it
shambled
after
him
dripping
and
eddie
suddenly
understood
it
meant
to
take
him
back
to
the
canal
to
carry
him
down
into
the
dank
blackness
of
the
canal
underground
passage
to
eat
him
there
eddie
put
on
a
burst
of
speed
the
arcsodium
light
at
the
gate
drew
closer
he
could
see
its
halo
of
bugs
and
moths
a
truck
went
by
headed
for
route
the
driver
working
his
way
up
through
the
gears
and
it
crossed
eddie
desperate
terrified
mind
that
he
could
be
drinking
coffee
from
a
paper
cup
and
listening
to
a
buddy
holly
tune
on
the
radio
completely
unaware
that
less
than
two
hundred
yards
away
there
was
a
boy
who
might
be
dead
in
another
twenty
seconds
the
stink
the
overwhelming
stink
of
it
gaining
all
around
him
it
was
a
park
bench
he
tripped
over
some
kids
had
casually
pushed
it
over
earlier
that
evening
heading
toward
their
homes
at
a
run
to
beat
the
curfew
its
seat
poked
an
inch
or
two
out
of
the
grass
one
shade
of
green
on
another
almost
invisible
in
the
moondriven
dark
the
edge
of
the
seat
smacked
eddie
in
the
shins
causing
a
burst
of
glassy
exquisite
pain
his
legs
flipped
out
behind
him
and
he
thumped
into
the
grass
he
looked
behind
him
and
saw
the
creature
bearing
down
its
white
poachedegg
eyes
glittering
its
scales
dripping
slime
the
color
of
seaweed
the
gills
up
and
down
its
bulging
neck
and
cheeks
opening
and
closing
a
gr
eddie
croaked
it
seemed
to
be
the
only
noise
he
could
make
ag
ag’ag.'ag
he
crawled
now
fingers
hooking
deep
into
the
turf
his
tongue
hung
out
in
the
second
before
the
creature
fish
smelling
horny
hands
closed
around
his
throat
a
comforting
thought
came
to
him
this
is
a
dream
it
has
to
be
there
no
real
creature
no
real
black
lagoon
and
even
if
there
was
that
was
in
south
america
or
the
florida
everglades
or
someplace
like
that
this
is
only
a
dream
and
i'll
wake
up
in
my
bed
or
maybe
in
the
leaves
under
the
bandstand
and
i
then
batrachian
hands
closed
around
his
neck
and
eddie
hoarse
cries
were
choked
off
as
the
creature
turned
him
over
the
chitinous
hooks
which
sprouted
from
those
hands
scrawled
bleeding
marks
like
calligraphy
into
his
neck
he
stared
into
its
glowing
white
eyes
he
felt
the
webs
between
its
fingers
pressing
against
his
throat
like
constricting
bands
of
living
seaweed
his
terrorsharpened
gaze
noted
the
fin
something
like
a
rooster
comb
and
something
like
a
hornpout
poisonous
backfin
standing
atop
the
creature
hunched
and
plated
head
as
its
hands
chmped
tight
shutting
off
his
air
he
was
even
able
to
see
the
way
the
white
light
from
the
arcsodium
lamp
turned
a
smoky
green
as
it
passed
through
that
membranous
headfin
you're
not
real
eddie
choked
but
clouds
of
grayness
were
closing
in
now
and
he
realized
faintly
that
it
was
real
enough
this
creature
it
was
after
all
killing
him
and
yet
some
rationality
remained
even
until
the
end
as
the
creature
hooked
its
claws
into
the
soft
meat
of
his
neck
as
his
carotid
artery
let
go
in
a
warm
and
painless
gout
that
splashed
the
thing
reptilian
plating
eddie
hands
groped
at
the
creature’s
back
feeling
for
a
zipper
they
fell
away
only
when
the
creature
tore
his
head
from
his
shoulders
with
a
low
satisfied
grunt
and
as
eddie
picture
of
what
it
was
began
to
fade
it
began
promptly
to
change
into
something
else
unable
to
sleep
plagued
by
bad
dreams
a
boy
named
michael
hanlon
rose
soon
after
first
light
on
the
first
full
day
of
summer
vacation
the
light
was
pale
bundled
up
in
a
low
thick
mist
that
would
lift
by
eight
o'clock
taking
the
wraps
off
a
perfect
summer
day
but
that
was
for
later
for
now
the
world
was
all
gray
and
rose
as
silent
as
a
cat
walking
on
a
carpet
mike
dressed
in
corduroys
a
teeshirt
and
black
hightopped
keds
came
downstairs
ate
a
bowl
of
wheaties
he
didn't
really
like
wheaties
but
had
wanted
the
free
prize
in
the
box
a
captain
midnight
magic
decoder
ring
then
hopped
on
his
bike
and
pedaled
toward
town
riding
on
the
sidewalks
because
of
the
fog
the
fog
changed
everything
made
the
most
ordinary
things
like
fire
hydrants
and
stopsigns
into
objects
of
mystery
things
both
strange
and
a
trifle
sinister
you
could
hear
cars
but
not
see
them
and
because
of
the
fog
odd
«oustic
quality
you
could
not
tell
if
they
were
far
or
near
until
you
actually
saw
them
come
rolling
out
of
the
fog
with
ghosthalos
of
moisture
ringing
their
headlamps
he
turned
right
on
jackson
street
bypassing
downtown
and
then
crossed
to
main
street
by
way
of
palmer
lane
and
during
his
short
ride
down
this
little
byway
oneblock
length
he
passed
the
house
where
he
would
live
as
an
adult
he
did
not
look
at
it
it
was
just
a
small
twostory
dwelling
with
a
garage
and
a
small
lawn
it
gave
off
no
special
vibration
to
the
passing
boy
who
would
spend
most
of
his
adult
life
as
its
owner
and
only
dweller
at
main
street
he
turned
right
and
rode
up
to
bassey
park
still
wandering
simply
riding
and
enjoying
the
stillness
of
the
early
day
once
nside
the
main
gate
he
dismounted
his
bike
pushed
down
the
kickstand
and
walked
toward
the
canal
he
was
still
as
far
as
he
knew
impelled
by
nothing
more
than
purest
whim
certainly
it
did
not
occur
to
him
to
think
that
his
dreams
of
the
night
before
had
anything
to
do
with
his
current
course
he
did
not
even
remember
exactly
what
his
dreams
had
been
only
that
one
had
followed
another
until
he
had
awakened
at
five
o'clock
sweaty
but
shivering
and
with
the
idea
that
he
ought
to
eat
a
fast
breakfast
and
then
take
a
bikeride
into
town
here
in
bassey
there
was
a
smell
in
the
fog
he
didn't
like
a
seasmell
salty
and
old
he
had
smelled
it
before
of
course
in
the
earlymoming
fogs
you
could
often
smell
the
ocean
in
derry
although
the
coast
was
forty
miles
away
but
the
smell
this
morning
seemed
thicker
more
vital
almost
dangerous
something
caught
his
eye
he
bent
down
and
picked
up
a
cheap
twoblade
pocket
knife
someone
had
scratched
the
initials
ec
on
the
side
mike
looked
at
it
thoughtfully
for
a
moment
or
two
and
then
pocketed
it
finders
keepers
losers
weepers
he
glanced
around
here
near
where
he
had
found
the
knife
was
an
overturned
park
bench
he
righted
it
setting
its
iron
footings
back
into
the
holes
they
had
made
over
aperiod
of
months
or
years
beyond
the
bench
he
saw
a
matted
place
in
the
grass
and
leading
away
from
it
two
grooves
the
grass
was
springing
back
up
but
those
grooves
were
still
fairly
clear
they
went
in
the
direction
of
the
canal
and
there
was
blood
the
bird
remember
the
bird
remember
the
but
he
did
not
want
to
remember
the
bird
and
so
he
pushed
the
thought
away
dogfight
that
all
one
of
em
must
have
hurt
the
other
one
pretty
bad
it
was
a
convincing
thought
by
which
he
was
somehow
not
convinced
thoughts
of
the
bird
kept
wanting
to
come
back
the
one
he
had
seen
out
at
the
kitchener
ironworks
one
stan
uris
never
would
have
found
in
his
birdbook
but
instead
of
getting
out
he
followed
the
grooves
as
he
did
he
made
up
a
ittle
story
in
his
mind
it
was
a
murder
story
here
this
kid
out
late
see
out
past
the
curfew
the
killer
gets
him
and
how
does
he
get
rid
of
the
body
drags
it
to
the
canal
and
dumps
it
in
of
course
just
like
an
alfred
hitchcock
presents
the
marks
he
was
following
could
have
been
made
by
a
dragging
pair
of
shoes
or
sneakers
he
supposed
mike
shivered
and
looked
around
uncertainly
the
story
was
somehow
a
little
too
real
and
suppose
that
it
wasn't
a
man
who
did
it
but
a
monster
like
out
of
a
horror
comic
or
a
horror
book
or
a
horror
movie
or
a
bad
dream
a
fairytale
or
something
he
decided
he
didn't
like
the
story
it
was
a
stupid
story
he
tried
to
push
it
out
of
his
mind
but
it
wouldn't
go
so
what
let
it
stay
it
was
dumb
riding
into
town
this
morning
had
been
dumb
following
these
two
matted
grooves
in
the
grass
was
dumb
his
dad
would
have
a
lot
of
chores
for
him
to
do
around
the
place
today
he
ought
to
get
back
and
start
in
or
when
the
hottest
part
of
the
afternoon
rolled
around
he
would
be
up
the
barn
loft
pitching
hay
yes
he
ought
to
get
back
and
that
just
what
he
was
going
to
do
sure
you
are
he
thought
want
to
bet
instead
of
going
back
to
his
bike
and
getting
on
and
riding
home
and
starting
his
chores
he
followed
the
grooves
in
the
grass
there
were
more
drops
of
drying
blood
here
and
there
not
much
though
not
as
much
as
there
had
been
in
that
matted
place
back
there
by
the
park
bench
he
had
set
to
rights
mike
could
hear
the
canal
now
running
quiet
a
moment
later
he
saw
the
concrete
edge
materialize
out
of
the
fog
here
was
something
else
in
the
grass
my
goodness
it
certainly
your
day
for
finding
things
his
mind
said
with
dubious
geniality
and
then
a
gull
screamed
somewhere
and
mike
flinched
thinking
again
of
the
bird
he
had
seen
that
day
that
day
just
this
spring
whatever
that
is
in
the
grass
i
don't
even
want
to
look
at
it
and
that
was
oh
so
very
true
but
here
he
was
already
bending
over
it
hands
planted
just
above
his
knees
to
see
what
it
was
a
tattered
bit
of
cloth
with
a
drop
of
blood
on
it
the
seagull
screamed
again
mike
stared
at
the
bloody
scrap
of
cloth
and
remembered
what
had
happened
to
him
in
the
spring
each
year
during
april
and
may
the
hanlon
farm
woke
up
from
its
winter
doze
mike
would
let
himself
know
that
spring
had
come
again
not
when
the
first
crocuses
showed
under
his
mom
kitchen
windows
or
when
kids
started
bringing
immies
and
croakers
to
school
or
even
when
the
washington
senators
kicked
off
the
baseball
season
usually
getting
themselves
shellacked
in
the
process
but
only
when
his
father
hollered
for
mike
to
help
him
push
their
mongrel
truck
out
of
the
barn
the
front
half
was
an
old
modeļ
a
ford
car
the
back
end
a
pckup
truck
with
a
tailgate
which
was
the
remainder
of
the
old
henhouse
door
if
the
winter
hadn't
been
too
cold
the
two
of
them
could
often
get
it
going
by
pushing
it
down
the
driveway
the
truck
cab
had
no
doors
likewise
there
was
no
windshield
the
seat
was
half
of
an
old
sofa
that
will
hanlon
had
scrounged
from
the
derry
dump
the
stickshift
ended
in
a
glass
doorknob
they
would
push
it
down
the
driveway
one
on
each
side
and
when
it
got
rolling
good
will
would
jump
in
turn
on
the
switch
etard
the
spark
step
down
on
the
clutch
punch
the
shift
into
first
gear
with
his
big
hand
clamped
over
the
doorknob
then
he
would
holler
put
me
over
the
hump
he'd
pop
the
clutch
and
the
old
ford
engine
would
cough
choke
chug
backfire
and
sometimes
actually
start
to
run
rough
at
first
then
smoothing
out
will
would
roar
down
the
road
toward
rhulin
farms
turn
around
in
their
driveway
if
he
had
gone
the
other
way
henry
bowers
crazy
father
butch
probably
would
have
blown
his
head
off
with
a
shotgun
and
then
roar
back
the
unmuffled
engine
blatting
stridently
while
mike
jumped
up
and
down
with
excitement
cheering
and
his
mom
stood
in
the
kitchen
doorway
wiping
her
hands
on
a
dishtowel
and
pretending
a
disgust
she
didn't
really
feel
other
times
the
truck
wouldn't
rollstart
and
mike
would
have
to
wait
until
his
father
came
back
from
the
barn
carrying
the
crank
and
muttering
under
his
breath
mike
was
quite
sure
that
some
of
the
words
so
muttered
were
swears
and
he
would
be
a
littk
frightened
of
his
daddy
then
it
wasn't
until
much
later
during
one
of
those
interminable
visits
to
the
hospital
room
where
will
hanlon
lay
dying
that
he
found
out
his
father
muttered
because
he
was
afraid
of
the
crank
once
it
had
kicked
back
viciously
flown
out
of
its
socket
and
torn
the
side
of
his
mouth
open.
stand
back
mikey
he
would
say
slipping
the
crank
into
its
socket
at
the
base
of
the
radiator
and
when
the
a
was
finally
running
he'd
say
that
next
year
he
was
going
to
trade
it
for
a
chevrolet
but
he
never
did
that
old
a
ford
hybrid
was
still
in
back
of
the
home
place
up
to
its
axles
and
henhouse
tailgate
in
weeds
when
it
was
running
and
mike
was
sitting
in
the
passenger
seat
smelling
hot
oil
and
blue
exhaust
excited
by
the
keen
breeze
that
washed
in
through
the
glassless
hole
where
the
windshield
had
once
been
he
would
think
spring
here
again
we're
all
waking
up
and
in
his
soul
he
would
raise
a
silent
cheer
that
shook
the
wails
of
that
mostly
cheerful
room
he
felt
love
for
everything
around
him
and
most
of
all
for
his
dad
who
would
grin
over
at
him
and
holler
hold
on
mikey
we
gone
wind
this
baby
up
we
gone
make
some
birds
run
for
cove
then
he
would
tear
up
the
driveway
the
a
rear
wheels
spitting
tack
black
dirt
and
gray
clods
of
clay
both
of
them
jouncing
up
and
down
on
the
sofaseat
inside
the
open
cab
laughing
like
stark
naturatborn
fools
will
would
run
the
a
through
the
high
grass
of
the
back
field
which
was
kept
for
hay
toward
either
the
south
field
potatoes
the
west
field
corn
and
beans
or
the
east
field
peas
squash
and
pumpkins
as
they
went
birds
would
burst
up
out
of
the
grass
before
the
truck
squawking
in
terror
once
a
partridge
flew
up
a
magnificent
bird
as
brown
as
latautumn
oaks
the
explosive
coughing
whit
of
its
wings
audible
even
over
the
pounding
engine
those
rides
were
mike
hanlon
door
into
spring
the
year
work
began
with
the
rock
harvest
every
day
for
a
week
they
would
take
the
a
out
and
load
the
bed
with
rocks
which
might
break
a
harrowblade
when
the
time
came
to
turn
the
earth
and
plant
sometimes
the
truck
would
get
stuck
in
the
mucky
spring
earth
and
will
would
mutter
darkly
under
his
breath
more
swears
mike
surmised
he
knew
some
of
the
words
and
expressions
others
such
as
son
of
a
whore
puzzled
him
he
had
come
across
the
word
in
the
bible
and
so
far
as
he
could
tell
a
whore
was
a
woman
who
came
from
a
place
called
babylon
he
had
once
set
out
to
ask
his
father
but
the
a
had
been
in
mud
up
to
her
coilsprings
there
had
been
thunderclouds
on
his
father
brow
and
he
had
decided
to
wait
for
a
better
time
he
ended
up
asking
richie
tozier
later
that
year
and
richie
told
him
his
father
had
told
him
a
whore
was
a
woman
who
got
paid
for
having
sex
with
men
what
having
sex
mike
had
asked
and
richie
had
wandered
away
holding
his
head
on
one
occasion
mike
had
asked
his
father
why
since
they
harvested
rocks
every
april
there
were
always
more
of
them
the
following
april
they
had
been
standing
at
the
dumpingoff
place
near
sunset
on
the
last
day
of
that
year
rock
harvest
a
beaten
dirt
track
not
quite
serious
enough
to
be
called
a
road
led
from
the
bottom
of
the
west
field
to
this
gully
near
the
bank
of
the
kenduskeag
the
gully
was
a
jumbled
wasteland
of
rocks
that
had
been
dragged
off
will
land
through
the
years
looking
down
at
this
badlands
which
he
had
made
first
alone
and
then
with
the
help
of
his
son
somewhere
under
the
rocks
he
knew
were
the
rotting
remains
of
the
stumps
he
had
yanked
out
one
at
a
time
before
any
of
the
fields
could
be
tilled
will
had
lighted
a
cigarette
and
said
my
daddy
used
to
tell
me
that
god
loved
rocks
houseflies
weeds
and
poor
people
above
all
the
rest
of
his
creations
and
that
why
he
made
so
many
of
them
but
every
year
it
like
they
come
back
yeah
i
think
they
do
will
said
that
the
only
way
i
know
to
explain
it
a
loon
cried
from
the
far
side
of
the
kenduskeag
in
a
dusky
sunset
that
had
turned
the
water
a
deep
orangered
it
was
a
lonely
sound
so
lonely
that
it
made
mike
tired
arms
tighten
with
gooseflesh
i
love
you
dadd
he
said
suddenly
feeling
his
love
so
strongly
that
tears
stung
his
eyes
why
i
love
you
too
mikey
his
father
said
and
hugged
him
tight
in
his
strong
arms
mike
felt
the
rough
fabric
of
his
father’s
flannel
shirt
against
his
cheek
now
what
do
you
say
we
go
on
back
we
got
just
time
to
get
a
bath
each
before
the
good
woman
puts
supper
on
the
table
ayu
mike
said
ayuh
yourself
will
hanlon
said
and
they
both
laughed
feeling
tired
but
feeling
good
arms
and
legs
worked
but
not
overworked
their
hands
rockroughened
but
not
hurting
too
bad
spring
here
mike
thought
that
night
drowsing
off
in
his
room
while
his
mother
and
father
watched
the
honeymooners
in
the
other
room
spring
here
again
thank
you
god
thank
you
very
much
and
turning
to
sleep
sinking
down
he
had
heard
the
loon
call
again
the
distance
of
its
marshes
blending
into
the
desire
of
his
dreams
spring
was
a
busy
time
but
it
was
a
good
time
following
the
rock
harvest
will
would
park
the
a
in
the
high
grass
back
of
the
house
and
drive
the
tractor
out
of
the
barn
there
would
be
harrowing
then
his
father
driving
the
tractor
mike
either
riding
behind
and
holding
on
to
the
iron
seat
or
walking
alongside
picking
up
any
rocks
they
had
missed
and
throwing
them
aside
then
came
planting
and
following
the
planting
came
summer
work
hoeing
hoeing
hoeing
his
mother
would
refurbish
larry
moe
and
curly
their
three
scarecrows
and
mike
would
help
his
father
put
mooseblowers
on
top
of
each
strawfilled
head
a
mooseblower
was
a
can
with
both
ends
cut
off
you
tied
a
length
of
heavily
waxed
and
rosined
string
tightly
across
the
middle
of
the
can
and
when
the
wind
blew
through
it
a
wonderfully
spooky
sound
resulted
a
kind
of
whining
croak
cropeating
birds
decided
soon
enough
that
larry
moe
and
curly
were
no
threats
but
the
mooseblowers
always
frightened
them
off
starting
in
july
there
was
picking
as
well
as
hoeing
peas
and
radishes
first
then
the
lettuce
and
the
tomatoes
that
had
been
started
in
the
shedboxes
then
the
corn
and
beans
in
august
more
corn
and
beans
in
september
then
the
pumpkins
and
the
squash
somewhere
in
the
midst
of
all
that
came
the
new
potatoes
and
then
as
the
days
shortened
and
the
air
sharpened
he
and
his
dad
would
take
in
the
mooseblowers
and
sometime
during
the
winter
they
would
disappear
it
seemed
they
had
to
nake
new
ones
each
spring
the
day
after
will
would
call
norman
sadler
who
was
as
dumb
as
his
son
moose
but
infinitely
more
goodhearted
and
normie
would
come
over
with
his
potatodigger
for
the
next
three
weeks
all
of
them
would
work
picking
potatoes
in
addition
to
the
family
will
would
hire
three
or
four
highschool
boys
to
help
pick
paying
them
a
quarter
a
barrel
the
aford
would
cruise
slowly
up
and
down
the
rows
of
the
south
field
the
biggest
field
always
in
low
gear
the
tailgate
down
he
back
filled
with
barrels
each
marked
with
the
name
of
the
person
picking
into
it
and
at
the
end
of
the
day
will
would
open
his
old
creased
wallet
and
pay
each
of
the
pickers
cash
money
mike
was
paid
and
so
was
his
mother
that
money
was
theirs
and
will
hanlon
never
once
asked
either
of
them
what
they
did
with
it
mike
had
been
given
a
fivepercent
interest
in
the
farm
when
he
was
five
years
old
old
enough
will
had
told
him
then
to
hold
a
hoe
and
to
tell
the
difference
between
witchgrass
and
peaplants
each
year
he
had
been
given
another
one
percent
and
each
year
on
the
day
after
thanksgiving
will
would
compute
the
farm
profits
and
deduct
mike
share
but
mike
never
saw
any
of
that
money
it
went
into
his
college
account
and
was
to
be
touched
under
absolutely
no
other
circumstances
at
last
the
day
would
come
when
normie
sadler
drove
his
potatodigger
back
home
by
then
the
air
would
have
most
likely
turned
gray
and
cold
and
there
would
be
frost
on
the
drift
of
orange
pumpkins
piled
against
the
side
of
the
barn
mike
would
stand
in
the
dooryard
his
nose
red
his
dirty
hands
stuffed
into
his
jeans
pockets
and
watch
as
his
father
drove
first
the
tractor
and
then
the
aford
back
into
the
barn
he
would
think
we're
getting
ready
to
go
to
sleep
again
spring
vanished
summer
gone
harvesttime
done
all
that
was
left
now
was
the
butt
end
of
autumn
leafless
trees
frozen
ground
a
lacing
of
ice
along
the
banks
of
the
kenduskeag
in
the
fields
crows
would
sometimes
land
on
the
shoulders
of
moe
larry
and
curly
and
stay
as
long
as
they
liked
the
scarecrows
were
voiceless
threatless
mike
would
not
exactly
be
dismayed
by
the
thought
of
another
year
ending
at
nine
and
ten
he
was
still
too
young
to
make
mortal
metaphors
because
there
was
plenty
to
look
forward
to
sledding
in
mccarron
park
or
on
rhulin
hill
out
here
in
derrytown
if
you
were
brave
although
that
was
mostly
for
big
kids
iceskating
snowball
fights
snowfort
building
there
was
time
to
think
about
snowshoeing
out
for
a
christmas
tree
with
his
daddy
and
time
to
think
about
the
nordica
downhill
skis
he
might
or
might
not
get
for
christmas
winter
was
good
but
watching
his
father
drive
the
a
back
into
the
barn
spring
vanished
summer
gone
harvesttime
done
always
made
him
feel
sad
the
way
the
squadrons
of
birds
heading
south
for
the
winter
made
him
feel
sad
or
the
way
a
certain
slant
of
light
could
sometimes
make
him
feel
like
crying
for
no
good
reason
we're
getting
ready
to
go
to
sleep
again
it
was
not
all
school
and
chores
chores
and
school
will
hanlon
had
told
his
wife
more
than
once
that
a
boy
needed
time
to
go
fishing
even
if
it
wasn't
fishing
he
was
really
doing
when
mike
came
home
from
school
he
first
put
his
books
on
the
tv
in
the
parlor
second
made
himself
some
kind
of
snack
he
was
particularly
partial
to
peanutbutterandonion
sandwiches
a
taste
that
made
his
mother
raise
her
hands
in
helpless
horror
and
third
studied
the
note
his
father
had
left
him
telling
mike
where
he
will
was
and
what
mike
chores
were
certain
rows
to
be
weeded
or
picked
baskets
to
be
carried
produce
to
be
rotated
the
barn
to
be
swept
whatever
but
on
at
least
one
schoolday
a
week
and
sometimes
two
there
would
be
no
note
and
on
these
days
mike
would
go
fishing
even
if
it
wasn't
really
fishing
he
was
doing
those
were
great
days
days
when
he
had
no
particular
place
to
go
and
consequently
felt
no
urge
to
get
there
in
a
hurry
once
in
awhile
his
father
left
him
another
sort
of
note
no
chores
one
might
say
go
over
to
old
cape
look
at
trolley
tracks
mike
would
go
over
to
the
old
cape
area
find
the
streets
with
the
tracks
still
embedded
in
them
and
inspect
them
closely
marvelling
to
think
of
things
like
trains
that
had
run
right
through
the
middle
of
the
streets
that
night
he
and
his
father
might
talk
about
them
and
his
dad
would
show
him
pictures
from
his
derry
album
of
the
trolleys
actually
running
a
funny
pole
went
from
the
roof
of
the
trolley
up
to
an
electrical
wire
and
there
were
cigarette
ads
on
the
side
another
time
he
had
sent
mike
to
memorial
park
where
the
standpipe
was
to
look
at
the
birdbath
and
once
they
had
gone
to
the
courthouse
together
to
look
at
a
terrible
machine
that
chief
borton
had
found
in
the
attic
this
gadget
was
called
a
trampchair
it
was
castiron
and
there
were
manacles
built
into
the
arms
and
legs
rounded
knobs
stuck
out
of
the
back
and
seat
it
reminded
mike
of
a
photograph
he
had
seen
in
some
book
a
photograph
of
the
electric
chair
at
sing
sing
chief
borton
let
mike
sit
in
the
trampchair
and
try
on
the
manacles
after
the
first
ominous
novelty
of
wearing
the
manacles
wore
off
mike
looked
questioningly
at
his
father
and
chief
borton
not
sure
why
this
was
supposed
to
be
such
a
horrible
punishment
for
the
vag
borton
word
for
them
that
had
drifted
into
town
in
the
twenties
and
thirties
the
knobs
made
the
chair
a
little
uncomfortable
to
sit
in
sure
and
the
manacles
on
your
wrists
and
ankles
made
it
hard
to
shift
to
a
more
comfortable
position
but
well
you're
just
a
kid
chief
borton
said
laughing
what
do
you
weigh
seventy
eighty
pounds
most
of
the
vags
sheriff
sully
posted
into
that
chair
in
the
old
days
would
go
twice
that
they'd
feel
a
bit
oncomfortable
after
an
hour
or
so
really
oncomfortable
after
two
or
three
and
right
bad
after
four
or
five
after
seven
or
eight
hours
they'd
staat
bellerin
and
after
sixteen
or
seventeen
they'd
staat
cryin
mostly
and
by
the
time
their
twentyfourhour
tour
was
up
they'd
be
willin
to
swear
before
god
and
man
that
the
next
time
they
came
riding
the
rods
up
new
england
way
they'd
give
derry
a
wide
berth
so
far
as
i
know
most
of
cm
did
twentyfour
hours
in
the
trampchair
was
a
helluva
persuader
suddenly
there
seemed
to
be
more
knobs
in
the
chair
digging
more
deeply
into
his
buttocks
spine
the
small
of
his
back
even
the
nape
of
his
neck
can
i
get
out
now
please
he
said
politely
and
chief
borton
laughed
again
there
was
a
moment
one
panicked
instant
of
time
when
mike
thought
the
chief
would
only
dangle
the
key
to
the
manacles
in
front
of
mike
eyes
and
say
sure
i'll
let
you
out
when
your
twentyfour
hours
is
up
why
did
you
take
me
there
daddy
he
asked
on
the
way
home
you'll
know
when
you're
older
will
had
replied
you
don't
like
chief
borton
do
you
n
his
father
had
replied
in
a
voice
so
curt
that
mike
hadn't
dared
ask
any
more
but
mike
enjoyed
most
of
the
places
in
derry
his
father
sent
or
took
him
to
and
by
the
time
mike
was
ten
will
had
succeeded
in
conveying
his
own
interest
in
the
layers
of
derry
history
to
his
son
sometimes
as
when
he
had
been
trailing
his
fingers
over
the
slightly
pebbled
surface
of
the
stand
in
which
the
memorial
park
birdbath
was
set
or
when
he
had
squatted
down
to
look
more
closely
at
the
trolley
tracks
which
grooved
mont
street
in
the
old
cape
he
would
be
struck
by
a
profound
sense
of
time
time
as
something
real
as
something
that
had
unseen
weight
the
way
sunlight
was
supposed
to
have
weight
some
of
the
kids
in
school
had
laughed
when
mrs
greenguss
told
them
that
but
mike
had
been
too
stunned
by
the
concept
to
laugh
his
first
thought
had
been
light
has
weight
oh
my
lord
that
terrible
time
as
something
that
would
eventually
bury
him
the
first
note
his
father
left
him
in
that
spring
of
was
scribbled
on
the
back
of
an
envelope
and
held
down
with
a
saltshaker
the
air
was
spring
warm
wonderfully
sweet
and
his
mother
had
opened
all
the
windows
no
chores
the
note
read
if
you
want
to
ride
your
bike
out
to
pasture
road
you'll
see
a
lot
of
tumbled
masonry
and
old
machinery
out
in
the
field
on
your
left
have
a
look
around
bring
back
a
souvenir
don't
go
near
the
cellarhole
and
be
back
before
dark
you
know
why
mike
knew
why
all
right
he
told
his
mother
where
he
was
going
and
she
frowned
why
don't
you
see
if
randy
robinson
wants
to
go
with
you
yeah
okay
i'll
stop
by
and
ask
hi
mike
said
he
dil
too
but
randy
had
gone
up
to
bangor
with
his
father
to
buy
seedling
potatoes
so
mike
rode
his
bike
over
to
pasture
road
alone
it
was
a
goodish
ride
a
little
over
four
miles
mike
reckoned
it
was
three
o'clock
by
the
time
he
leaned
his
bike
against
an
old
wooden
slatfence
on
the
left
side
of
pasture
road
and
climbed
into
the
field
beyond
he
would
have
maybe
an
hour
to
explore
and
then
he
would
have
to
start
home
again
ordinarily
his
mother
would
not
be
upset
with
him
as
long
as
he
was
back
by
six
when
she
put
dinner
on
the
table
but
one
memorable
episode
had
taught
him
that
wasn't
the
case
this
year
on
that
one
occasion
when
he
had
been
late
for
dinner
she
had
been
nearly
hysterical
she
took
after
him
with
a
dishrag
whopping
him
with
it
as
he
stood
open
mouthed
in
the
kitchen
entryway
his
wicker
creel
with
the
rainbow
trout
in
it
at
his
feet
don't
you
ever
scare
me
like
that
she
had
screamed
don't
you
ever
don't
you
ever
everevereve
each
ever
had
been
punctuated
by
another
dishrag
swat
mike
had
expected
his
father
to
step
in
and
put
a
stop
to
it
but
his
father
hadn't
done
so
perhaps
he
knew
that
if
he
did
she
would
turn
her
wildcat
anger
on
him
as
well
mike
had
learned
the
lesson
one
whopping
with
the
dishrag
was
all
it
took
home
before
dark
yes
ma'am
righto
he
walked
across
the
field
toward
the
titanic
ruins
standing
in
the
center
this
was
of
course
the
remains
of
the
kitchener
ironworks
he
had
ridden
past
it
but
had
never
thought
to
actually
explore
it
and
he
had
never
heard
any
kids
saying
that
they
had
now
stooping
to
examine
a
few
tumbled
bricks
that
had
formed
a
rough
cairn
he
thought
he
could
understand
why
the
field
was
dazzlingly
bright
washed
by
sun
from
the
spring
sky
occasionally
as
a
cloud
passed
before
the
sun
a
great
shutter
of
shadow
would
travel
slowly
across
the
field
but
there
was
something
spooky
about
it
all
the
same
a
brooding
silence
that
was
broken
only
by
the
wind
he
felt
like
an
explorer
who
has
found
the
last
emnants
of
some
fabulous
lost
city
up
ahead
and
to
the
right
he
saw
the
rounded
side
of
a
massive
tile
cylinder
rising
out
of
the
high
field
grass
he
ran
over
to
it
it
was
the
ironworks
main
smokestack
he
peered
into
its
bore
and
felt
a
fresh
chill
worm
up
his
spine
it
was
big
enough
so
he
could
have
walked
into
it
if
he
had
wanted
but
he
didn't
want
to
god
knew
what
strange
guck
there
might
be
clinging
to
the
smokeblackened
inner
tiles
or
what
nasty
bugs
or
beasts
might
have
taken
up
residence
inside
the
wind
gusted
when
it
blew
across
the
mouth
of
the
fallen
stack
it
made
a
sound
eerily
like
the
sound
of
the
wind
vibrating
the
waxed
strings
he
and
his
dad
put
in
the
mooseblowers
every
spring
he
stepped
back
nervously
suddenly
thinking
about
the
movie
he
and
his
father
had
watched
last
night
on
the
early
show
it
had
been
called
rodan
and
watching
it
had
seemed
like
great
fun
at
the
time
his
father
laughing
and
shouting
git
that
bird
mikey
every
time
rodan
made
its
appearance
mike
shooting
with
his
finger
until
his
mom
popped
her
head
in
and
told
them
to
hush
up
before
they
gave
her
a
headache
with
the
noise
it
didn't
seem
so
funny
now
in
the
movie
rodan
had
been
released
from
the
bowels
of
the
earth
by
these
japanese
coalminers
who
had
been
digging
the
world
deepest
tunnel
and
looking
into
the
black
bore
of
this
pipe
it
was
all
too
easy
to
imagine
that
bird
crouched
at
the
far
end
leathery
batlike
wings
folded
over
its
back
staring
at
the
small
round
boyface
looking
nto
the
darkness
staring
staring
with
its
gold
ringed
eyes
shivering
mike
pulled
back
he
walked
aways
down
the
smokestack
which
had
sunken
into
the
earth
to
half
of
its
circumference
the
land
rose
slightly
and
on
impulse
he
scrambled
his
way
up
on
top
the
stack
was
a
lot
less
scary
on
the
outside
its
tiled
surface
sunwarm
he
got
to
his
feet
and
strolled
along
holding
his
arms
out
the
surface
was
really
too
wide
for
him
to
need
to
worry
about
falling
off
but
he
was
pretending
he
was
a
tightwirewalker
in
the
circus
liking
the
way
the
wind
blew
through
his
hair
at
the
far
end
he
jumped
down
and
began
to
examine
stuff
more
bricks
twisted
molds
hunks
of
wood
pieces
of
rusty
machinery
bring
back
a
souvenir
his
father
note
had
said
he
wanted
a
good
one
he
wandered
closer
to
the
mill
yawning
cellarhold
looking
at
the
debris
being
careful
not
to
cut
himself
on
the
broken
glass
there
was
a
lot
of
it
around
mike
was
not
unmindful
of
the
cellarhold
and
his
father
warning
to
stay
out
of
it
neither
was
he
unmindful
of
the
death
that
had
been
dealt
out
on
this
spot
fiftyodd
years
before
he
supposed
that
if
there
was
a
haunted
place
in
derry
this
was
it
but
either
in
spite
of
that
or
because
of
it
he
was
determined
to
stay
until
he
found
something
really
good
to
take
back
and
show
his
father
he
moved
slowly
and
soberly
toward
the
cellarhold
changing
his
course
to
parallel
its
ragged
side
when
a
warning
voice
inside
whispered
that
he
was
getting
too
close
that
a
bank
weakened
by
the
spring
rains
could
crumble
under
his
heels
and
pitch
him
into
that
hole
where
god
only
knew
how
much
sharp
iron
might
be
waiting
to
impale
him
like
a
bug
leaving
him
to
die
a
rusty
twitching
death
he
picked
up
a
windowsash
and
tossed
it
aside
here
was
a
dipper
big
enough
for
a
giant
table
its
handle
rippled
and
warped
by
some
unimaginable
flash
of
heat
here
was
a
piston
too
big
for
him
to
even
budge
let
alone
lift
he
stepped
over
it
he
stepped
over
it
and
what
if
i
find
a
skull
he
thought
suddenly
the
skull
of
one
of
the
kids
who
were
killed
here
while
they
were
hunting
for
chocolate
easter
eggs
back
in
nineteenwheneveritwas
he
looked
around
the
sunwashed
empty
field
nastily
shocked
by
the
idea
the
wind
blew
a
low
conchnote
in
his
ears
and
another
shadow
cruised
silently
across
the
field
like
the
shadow
of
a
giant
bat
or
bird
he
became
aware
all
over
again
of
how
quiet
it
was
here
and
how
strange
the
field
looked
with
its
straggling
piles
of
masonry
and
its
beached
iron
hulks
leaning
this
way
and
that
it
was
as
if
some
horrid
battle
had
been
fought
here
long
ago
don't
be
such
a
dip
he
replied
uneasily
to
himself
they
found
everything
there
was
to
find
fifty
years
ago
after
it
happened
and
even
if
they
didn't
some
other
kid
or
grownup
would
have
found
the
rest
since
then
or
do
you
think
you're
the
only
person
who
ever
came
here
hunting
for
souvenirs
no...no
i
don't
think
that
but
but
what
that
rational
side
of
his
mind
demanded
and
mike
thought
it
was
talking
just
a
little
too
loud
a
little
too
fast
even
if
there
was
still
something
to
find
it
would
have
decayed
long
ago
so
what
mike
found
a
splintered
desk
drawer
in
the
weeds
he
glanced
at
it
tossed
it
aside
and
moved
a
little
closer
to
the
cellarhold
where
the
stuff
was
thickest
surely
he
would
find
something
there
but
what
if
there
are
ghosts
that
but
what
what
if
i
see
hands
coming
over
the
edge
of
that
cellarhold
and
what
if
they
start
to
come
up
kids
in
the
remains
of
their
easter
sunday
clothes
clothes
that
are
all
rotted
and
torn
and
marked
with
fifty
years
of
spring
mud
and
fall
rain
and
caked
winter
snow
kids
with
no
heads
he
had
heard
at
school
that
after
the
explosion
a
woman
had
found
the
head
of
one
of
the
victims
in
a
tree
in
her
back
yard
kids
with
no
legs
kids
flayed
open
like
codfish
kids
just
like
me
who
would
maybe
come
down
and
play
down
there
where
it
dark
under
the
leaning
iron
girders
and
the
big
old
rusty
cogs
oh
stop
it
for
the
lord
sake
but
a
shudder
wrenched
its
way
up
his
back
and
he
decided
it
was
time
to
take
something
anything
and
get
the
dickens
out
of
here
he
reached
down
almost
at
random
and
came
up
with
a
geartoothed
wheel
about
seven
niches
in
diameter
he
had
a
pencil
in
his
pocket
and
he
used
it
quickly
to
dig
the
dirt
out
of
the
teeth
then
he
slipped
his
souvenir
in
his
pocket
he
would
go
now
he
would
go
yes
but
his
feet
moved
slowly
in
the
wrong
direction
toward
the
cellarhold
and
he
realized
with
a
dismal
sort
of
horror
that
he
needed
to
look
down
inside
he
had
to
see
he
gripped
a
spongy
supportbeam
leaning
out
of
the
earth
and
swayed
forward
trying
to
see
down
and
inside
he
couldn't
quite
do
it
he
had
come
to
within
fifteen
feet
of
the
edge
but
that
was
still
a
little
too
far
to
see
the
bottom
of
the
cellarhold
i
don't
care
if
i
see
the
bottom
or
not
i'm
going
back
now
i've
got
my
souvenir
i
don't
need
to
look
down
into
any
crummy
old
hole
and
daddy
note
said
to
stay
away
from
it
but
the
unhappy
almost
feverish
curiosity
that
had
gripped
him
would
not
let
go
he
approached
the
cellarhold
step
by
queasy
step
aware
that
as
soon
as
the
wooden
beam
was
out
of
his
reach
there
would
be
no
more
grabholds
also
aware
that
the
ground
here
was
indeed
squelchy
and
crumbly
in
places
along
the
edge
he
could
see
depressions
like
graves
that
had
fallen
in
and
knew
that
they
were
the
sites
of
previous
caveins
heart
thudding
in
his
chest
like
the
hard
measured
strides
of
a
soldier
boots
he
reached
the
edge
and
looked
down
nested
in
the
cellarhold
the
bird
looked
up
mike
was
not
at
first
sure
what
he
was
seeing
all
the
nerves
and
pathways
in
his
body
seemed
frozen
including
those
which
conducted
thoughts
it
was
not
just
the
shock
of
seeing
a
monster
bird
a
bird
whose
breast
was
as
orange
as
a
robin
and
whose
feathers
were
the
unremarkable
fluffy
gray
of
a
sparrow
feathers
most
of
it
was
the
shock
of
the
utterly
unexpected
he
had
expected
monoliths
of
machinery
halfsubmerged
in
stagnant
puddles
and
black
mud
instead
he
was
looking
down
into
a
giant
nest
which
filled
the
cellarhold
from
end
to
end
and
side
to
side
it
had
been
made
out
of
enough
timothy
grass
to
make
a
dozen
bales
of
hay
but
this
grass
was
silvery
and
old
the
bird
sat
in
the
middle
of
it
its
brightly
ringed
eyes
as
black
as
fresh
warm
tar
and
for
an
insane
moment
before
his
paralysis
broke
mike
could
see
himself
reflected
in
each
of
them
then
the
ground
suddenly
began
to
shift
and
run
out
from
beneath
his
feet
he
heard
the
tearing
sound
of
shallow
roots
giving
way
and
realized
he
was
sliding
with
a
yell
he
threw
himself
backward
pinwheeling
his
arms
for
balance
he
lost
it
and
thumped
heavily
to
the
littered
ground
some
hard
dull
chunk
of
metal
pressed
painfully
into
his
back
and
he
had
time
to
think
of
the
trampchair
before
he
heard
the
whirring
explosive
sound
of
the
bird
wings
he
scrambled
to
his
knees
crawled
looked
back
over
his
shoulder
and
saw
it
rising
out
of
the
cellarhold
its
scaly
talons
were
a
dusky
orange
its
beating
wings
each
more
than
ten
feet
across
blew
the
scraggy
timothy
grass
this
way
and
that
paternlessly
like
the
wind
generated
by
helicopter
rotors
it
uttered
a
buzzing
chirruping
scream
a
few
loose
feathers
slipped
from
its
wings
and
spiraled
back
down
into
the
cellarhold
mike
gained
his
feet
again
and
began
to
run
he
pounded
across
the
field
not
looking
back
now
afraid
to
look
back
the
bird
did
not
look
like
rodan
but
he
sensed
it
was
the
spirit
of
rodan
risen
from
the
cellarhold
of
the
kitchener
ironworks
like
a
horrible
birdinthebox
he
stumbled
went
to
one
knee
got
up
and
ran
on
that
weird
chirruping
buzzing
screech
came
again
a
shadow
covered
him
and
when
he
looked
up
he
saw
the
thing
it
had
passed
less
than
five
feet
over
his
head
its
beak
dirty
yellow
opened
and
closed
revealing
a
pink
lining
inside
it
whirled
back
toward
mike
the
wind
it
generated
washed
across
his
face
bringing
a
dry
unpleasant
smell
with
it
attic
dust
dead
antiques
rotting
cushions
he
jigged
to
his
left
and
now
he
saw
the
fallen
smokestack
again
he
sprinted
for
it
running
allout
his
arms
pumping
in
short
jabbing
strokes
at
his
sides
the
bird
screamed
and
he
heard
its
fluttering
wings
they
sounded
like
sails
something
slammed
into
the
back
of
his
head
warm
fire
traced
its
way
up
the
nape
of
his
neck
he
felt
it
spread
as
blood
began
to
trickle
down
the
back
of
his
shirtcollar
the
bird
whirled
around
again
meaning
to
pick
him
up
with
its
talons
and
carry
him
away
like
a
hawk
with
a
fieldmouse
meaning
to
carry
him
back
to
its
nest
meaning
to
eat
him
as
it
flew
at
him
swooping
down
its
black
horribly
alive
eyes
fixed
on
him
mike
cut
sharply
right
the
bird
missed
him
barely
the
dusty
smell
of
its
wings
was
overpowering
unbearable
now
he
was
running
parallel
to
the
fallen
smokestack
its
tiles
blurring
by
he
could
see
where
it
ended
if
he
could
reach
the
end
and
buttonhook
to
the
left
get
inside
he
might
be
safe
he
thought
the
bird
was
too
big
to
squeeze
inside
he
came
very
close
to
not
making
it
the
bird
flew
at
him
again
pulling
up
as
it
closed
in
its
wings
flapping
and
pushing
air
in
a
hurricane
its
scaly
talons
now
angled
toward
him
and
descending
it
screamed
again
and
this
time
mike
thought
he
heard
triumph
in
its
voice
he
lowered
his
head
put
his
arm
up
and
rammed
straight
drward
the
talons
closed
and
for
a
moment
the
bird
had
him
by
the
forearm
the
grip
was
like
the
clutch
of
incredibly
strong
fingers
tipped
with
tough
nails
they
bit
like
teeth
the
bird
flapping
wings
were
a
thunder
in
his
ears
he
was
dimly
aware
of
feathers
falling
around
him
some
brushing
past
his
cheeks
like
phantom
kisses
the
bird
rose
then
and
for
just
a
moment
mike
felt
himself
pulled
upward
first
straight
then
on
tiptoe
and
for
one
freezing
second
he
felt
the
toes
of
his
keds
lose
contact
with
the
earth
let
me
go
he
screamed
at
it
and
twisted
his
arm
for
a
moment
the
talons
held
on
and
then
the
sleeve
of
his
shirt
ripped
he
thumped
back
down
the
bird
squalled
mike
ran
again
brushing
through
the
thing
tailfeathers
gagging
at
that
dry
smell
it
was
like
running
through
a
shower
curtain
of
feathers
still
coughing
eyes
stinging
from
both
tears
and
whatever
vile
dust
coated
the
bird
feathers
he
stumbled
into
the
fallen
smokestack
there
was
no
thought
now
of
what
might
be
lurking
inside
he
ran
into
the
darkness
his
gasping
sobs
taking
on
a
flat
echo
he
went
back
perhaps
twenty
feet
and
then
turned
toward
the
bright
circle
of
daylight
his
chest
was
rising
and
falling
in
quick
jerks
he
was
suddenly
aware
that
if
he
had
misjudged
either
the
size
of
the
bird
or
the
size
of
the
smokestack
muzzle
he
had
killed
himself
as
surely
as
if
he
had
put
his
father
shotgun
to
his
head
and
pulled
the
trigger
there
was
no
way
out
this
wasn't
just
a
pipe
it
was
a
blind
alley
the
other
end
of
the
stack
was
buried
in
the
earth
the
bird
squalled
again
and
suddenly
the
light
at
the
end
of
the
smokestack
was
blotted
out
as
it
lighted
on
the
ground
outside
he
could
see
its
yellow
scaly
legs
each
as
thick
as
a
man
cab
then
it
cocked
its
head
down
and
looked
inside
mike
found
himself
again
staring
into
those
hideously
bright
freshtar
eyes
with
their
gold
weddingrings
of
iris
the
bird
beak
opened
and
closed
opened
and
closed
and
each
time
it
snapped
shut
he
heard
an
audible
click
like
the
sound
you
hear
in
your
own
ears
when
you
snap
your
teeth
together
hard
sharp
he
thought
its
beak
is
sharp
i
guess
i
knew
birds
had
sharp
beaks
but
i
never
really
thought
about
it
until
now
it
squawked
again
the
ound
was
so
loud
in
the
tile
throat
of
the
stack
that
mike
clapped
his
hands
to
his
ears
the
bird
began
to
force
itself
into
the
mouth
of
the
stack
n
mike
cried
no
you
can't
the
light
faded
as
more
of
the
bird
body
pressed
its
way
into
the
stack
bore
oh
my
lord
why
didn't
i
remember
it
was
mostly
feathers
why
didn't
i
remember
it
could
squeeze
the
light
faded
faded
was
gone
now
there
was
only
an
inky
blackness
the
suffocating
atticsmell
of
the
bird
and
the
rustling
sound
of
its
feathers
mike
fell
on
his
knees
and
began
to
grope
on
the
curved
floor
of
the
smokestack
his
hands
spread
wide
feeling
he
found
a
piece
of
broken
tile
its
sharp
edges
furred
with
what
felt
like
moss
he
cocked
his
arm
back
and
pegged
it
there
was
a
thump
the
bird
uttered
its
buzzing
chirruping
sound
again
get
out
of
here
mike
screamed
there
was
silence
and
then
that
crackly
rustling
sound
began
again
as
the
bird
resumed
forcing
itself
into
the
pipe
mike
£lt
along
the
floor
found
other
pieces
of
tile
and
began
to
throw
one
after
another
they
thumped
and
thudded
off
the
bird
and
then
clinked
to
the
tile
sleeve
of
the
smokestack
please
god
mike
thought
incoherently
please
god
phase
god
please
god
it
came
to
him
that
he
ought
to
retreat
down
the
smokestack
bore
he
had
run
in
through
what
had
been
the
stack
base
it
stood
to
reason
that
it
would
narrow
as
he
backed
up
he
could
retreat
yes
and
listen
to
that
low
dusty
rustle
as
the
brd
worked
its
way
in
after
him
he
could
retreat
and
if
he
was
lucky
he
might
get
beyond
the
point
where
the
bird
could
continue
to
advance
but
what
if
the
bird
got
stuck
if
that
happened
he
and
the
bird
would
die
in
here
together
they
would
die
in
here
together
and
rot
in
here
together
in
the
dark
please
god
he
screamed
and
was
totally
unaware
that
he
had
cried
out
aloud
he
threw
another
piece
of
tile
and
this
time
his
throw
was
more
powerful
he
felt
he
told
the
others
much
later
as
if
someone
were
behind
him
at
that
moment
and
that
someone
had
given
his
arm
a
tremendous
push
this
time
there
was
no
feathery
thud
instead
there
was
a
splatting
sound
the
sound
a
kid
hand
might
make
slapping
into
the
surface
of
a
bowl
of
half
solidified
jello
this
time
the
bird
screamed
not
in
anger
but
in
real
pain
the
tenebrous
whirr
of
its
wings
filled
the
smokestack
stinking
air
streamed
past
mike
in
a
hurricane
flapping
his
clothes
making
him
cough
and
gag
and
retreat
as
dust
and
moss
flew
light
appeared
again
gray
and
weak
at
first
then
brightening
and
shifting
as
the
bird
retreated
from
the
stack
muzzle
mike
burst
into
tears
fell
to
his
knees
again
and
began
grubbing
madly
for
more
pieces
of
tile
without
any
conscious
thought
he
ran
forward
with
both
hands
full
of
tiling
in
this
light
he
could
see
the
pieces
were
splotched
with
blue
gray
moss
and
lichen
like
the
surface
of
slate
gravestones
until
he
was
nearly
at
the
mouth
of
the
stack
he
intended
to
keep
the
bird
from
coming
back
in
if
he
could
it
bent
down
cocking
its
head
the
way
a
trained
bird
on
a
perch
will
sometimes
cock
its
head
and
mike
saw
where
his
last
shot
had
struck
home
the
bird
right
eye
was
nearly
gone
instead
of
that
glittering
bubble
of
fresh
tar
there
was
a
crater
filled
with
blood
whitishgray
goo
dripped
from
the
corner
of
the
socket
and
trickled
along
the
side
of
the
bird
beak
tiny
parasites
wriggled
and
squirmed
in
this
pussy
discharge
it
saw
him
and
lunged
forward
mike
began
to
throw
chunks
of
tile
at
it
they
struck
its
head
and
beak
it
withdrew
for
a
moment
and
then
lunged
again
beak
opening
revealing
that
pink
lining
again
revealing
something
else
that
caused
mike
to
freeze
for
a
moment
his
own
mouth
dropping
open
the
bird
tongue
was
silver
its
surface
as
crazycracked
as
the
surface
of
a
volcanic
land
which
has
first
baked
and
then
slagged
off
and
on
this
tongue
like
weird
tumbleweeds
that
had
taken
temporary
root
there
were
a
number
of
orange
puffs
mike
threw
the
last
of
his
tiles
directly
into
that
gaping
maw
and
the
bird
withdrew
again
screaming
its
frustration
rage
and
pain
for
a
moment
mike
could
see
its
reptilian
talons
then
its
wings
ruffled
the
air
and
it
was
gone
a
moment
àter
he
lifted
his
face
a
face
that
was
graybrown
under
the
dirt
dust
and
bits
of
moss
that
the
bird
windmachine
wings
had
blown
at
him
toward
the
clicking
sound
of
its
talons
on
the
tile
the
only
clean
places
on
mike
face
were
the
tracks
that
had
been
washed
clean
by
his
tears
the
bird
walked
back
and
forth
overhead
tak
taktak
tak
mike
retreated
a
bit
gathered
up
more
chunks
of
tile
and
heaped
them
as
close
to
the
mouth
of
the
stack
as
he
dared
if
the
thing
came
back
he
wanted
to
be
able
to
fire
at
it
from
pointblank
range
the
light
outside
was
still
bight
now
that
it
was
may
it
wouldn't
get
dark
for
a
long
time
yet
but
suppose
the
bird
just
decided
to
wait
mike
swallowed
the
dry
sides
of
his
throat
rubbing
together
for
a
moment
overhead
tak
tak
tak
he
had
a
fine
pile
of
ammunition
now
in
the
dim
light
here
beyond
the
place
where
the
angle
of
the
sun
made
a
shadowspiral
inside
the
pipe
it
looked
like
a
pile
of
broken
crockery
swept
together
by
a
housewife
mike
rubbed
the
palms
of
his
dirty
hands
along
the
sides
of
his
jeans
and
waited
to
see
what
would
happen
next
a
space
of
time
passed
before
something
did
whether
five
minutes
or
twentyfive
he
could
not
tell
he
was
only
aware
of
the
bird
walking
back
and
forth
overhead
like
an
insomniac
pacing
the
floor
at
three
in
the
morning
then
its
wings
fluttered
again
it
landed
in
front
of
the
smokestack
opening
mike
on
his
knees
just
behind
his
pile
of
tiling
began
to
peg
missiles
at
it
before
it
could
even
bend
its
head
down
one
of
them
slammed
into
a
plated
yellow
leg
and
drew
a
trickle
of
blood
so
dark
it
seemed
almost
as
black
as
the
bird
eyes
mike
screamed
in
triumph
the
sound
thin
and
almost
lost
under
the
bird
own
enraged
squawk
get
out
of
here
mike
cried
t'm
going
to
keep
hitting
you
until
you
get
out
of
here
i
swear
to
god
i
will
the
bird
flew
up
to
the
top
of
the
smokestack
and
resumed
its
pacing
mike
waited
finally
its
wings
ruffled
again
as
it
took
off
mike
waited
expecting
the
yellow
feet
so
like
hen
feet
to
appear
again
they
didn't
he
waited
longer
convinced
it
had
to
be
some
kind
of
a
trick
realizing
at
last
that
that
wasn't
why
he
was
waiting
at
all
he
was
waiting
because
he
was
scared
to
go
out
scared
to
leave
the
safety
of
this
bolthole
never
mind
never
mind
stuff
like
that
i'm
not
a
rabbit
he
took
as
many
chunks
of
tile
as
he
could
handle
comfortably
then
put
some
more
inside
his
shirt
he
stepped
out
of
the
smokestack
trying
to
look
everywhere
at
once
and
wishing
madly
for
eyes
in
the
back
of
his
head
he
saw
only
the
field
stretching
ahead
and
around
him
littered
with
the
exploded
rusting
remains
of
the
kitchener
ironworks
he
wheeled
around
sure
he
would
see
the
bird
perched
on
the
lip
of
the
stack
like
a
vulture
a
oneeyed
vulture
now
only
wanting
the
boy
to
see
him
before
it
attacked
for
the
final
time
using
that
sharp
beak
to
jab
and
rip
and
strip
but
the
bird
was
not
there
it
was
really
gone
mike
nerve
snapped
he
uttered
a
breaking
scream
of
fear
and
ran
for
the
weatherbeaten
fence
between
the
field
and
the
road
dropping
the
last
pieces
of
tile
from
his
hands
most
of
the
others
fell
out
of
his
shirt
as
the
shirt
pulled
free
of
his
belt
he
vaulted
over
the
fence
onehanded
like
roy
rogers
showing
off
for
dale
evans
on
his
way
back
from
the
corral
with
pat
brady
and
the
rest
of
the
buckaroos
he
grabbed
the
handlebars
of
his
bike
and
ran
beside
it
forty
feet
up
the
road
before
getting
on
then
he
pedaled
madly
not
daring
to
look
back
not
daring
to
slow
down
until
he
reached
the
intersection
of
pasture
road
and
outer
main
street
where
there
were
lots
of
cars
passing
back
and
forth
when
he
got
home
his
father
was
changing
the
plugs
on
the
tractor
will
observed
that
mike
looked
powerful
musty
and
dusty
mike
hesitated
for
just
a
split
second
and
then
told
his
father
that
he'd
taken
a
tumble
from
his
bike
on
the
way
home
swerving
to
avoid
a
pothole
did
you
break
anything
mikey
will
asked
observing
his
son
a
little
more
carefully
no
sir
sprains
hubuh
sur
*
mike
nodded
did
you
pick
yourself
up
a
souvenir
mike
reached
into
his
pocket
and
found
the
gearwheel
he
showed
it
to
his
father
who
looked
at
it
briefly
and
then
plucked
a
tiny
crumb
of
tiling
from
the
pad
of
flesh
just
below
mike
thumb
he
seemed
more
interested
in
this
from
that
old
smokestack
will
asked
mike
nodded
you
go
inside
there
mike
nodded
again
see
anything
in
there
will
asked
and
then
as
if
to
make
a
joke
of
the
question
which
hadn't
sounded
like
a
joke
at
all
he
added
buried
treasure
smiling
a
little
mike
shook
his
head
well
don't
tell
your
mother
you
was
muckin
about
in
there
will
said
she'd
shoot
me
first
and
you
second
he
looked
even
more
closely
at
his
son
mikey
are
you
all
right
huh
you
look
a
little
peaky
around
the
eyes
guess
i
might
be
a
little
tired
mike
said
it
eight
or
ten
miles
there
and
back
again
don't
forget
you
want
some
help
with
the
tractor
daddy
no
i'm
about
done
screwing
it
up
for
this
week
you
go
on
in
and
wash
up
mike
started
away
and
then
his
father
called
to
him
once
more
mike
boked
back
don't
want
you
going
around
that
place
agai
he
said
at
least
not
until
all
this
trouble
is
cleared
up
and
they
catch
the
man
who
doing
it
you
didn't
see
anybody
out
there
did
you
no
one
chased
you
or
hollered
you
down
i
didn't
see
any
people
at
all
mike
said
will
nodded
and
lit
a
cigarette
i
think
i
was
wrong
to
send
you
there
old
places
like
that
sometimes
they
can
be
dangerous
their
eyes
locked
briefly
okay
daddy
mike
said
i
don't
want
to
go
back
anyway
it
was
a
little
spooky
will
nodded
again
less
said
the
better
i
reckon
you
go
and
get
cleaned
up
now
and
tell
her
to
put
on
three
or
four
extra
sausages
mike
did
never
mind
that
now
mike
hanlon
thought
looking
at
the
grooves
which
went
up
to
the
concrete
edge
of
the
canal
and
stopped
there
never
mind
that
it
might
just
have
been
a
dream
anyhow
and
there
were
splotches
of
dried
blood
on
the
lip
of
the
canal
mike
looked
at
these
and
then
he
looked
down
into
the
canal
black
water
flowed
smoothly
past
runners
of
dirty
yellow
foam
clung
to
the
canal’
sides
sometimes
breaking
free
to
flow
downstream
in
lazy
loops
and
curves
for
a
moment
just
a
moment
two
clots
of
this
foam
came
together
and
seemed
to
form
a
face
a
kid
face
its
eyes
turned
up
in
an
avatar
of
terror
and
agony
mike
breath
caught
as
if
on
a
thorn
the
foam
broke
apart
became
meaningless
again
and
at
that
moment
there
was
a
loud
splash
on
his
right
mike
snapped
his
head
around
shrinking
back
a
little
and
for
a
moment
he
believed
he
saw
something
in
the
shadows
of
the
outflow
tunnel
where
the
canal
resurfaced
after
its
course
under
downtown
then
it
was
gone
suddenly
cold
and
shuddering
he
dug
in
his
pocket
for
the
knife
he
had
found
in
the
grass
he
threw
it
into
the
canal
there
was
a
small
splash
a
ripple
that
began
as
a
circle
and
was
then
tugged
into
the
shape
of
an
arrowhead
by
the
current
then
nothing
nothing
except
the
fear
that
was
suddenly
suffocating
him
and
the
deadly
certainty
that
there
was
something
near
something
watching
him
gauging
its
chances
biding
its
time
he
turned
meaning
to
walk
back
to
his
bike
to
run
would
be
to
dignify
those
fears
and
undignify
himself
and
then
that
splashing
sound
came
again
it
was
a
lot
louder
this
second
time
so
much
for
dignity
suddenly
he
was
running
as
fast
as
he
could
beating
his
buns
for
the
gate
and
his
bike
jamming
the
kickstand
up
with
one
heel
and
pedaling
for
the
street
as
fast
as
he
could
that
seasmell
was
all
at
once
too
thick
much
too
thick
it
was
everywhere
and
the
water
dripping
from
the
wet
branches
of
the
trees
seemed
much
too
loud
something
was
coming
he
heard
dragging
lurching
footsteps
in
the
grass
he
stood
on
the
pedals
giving
it
everything
and
shot
out
onto
main
street
without
looking
back
he
headed
for
home
as
fast
as
he
could
wondering
what
in
hell
had
possessed
him
to
come
in
the
first
place
what
had
drawn
him
and
then
he
tried
to
think
about
the
chores
the
whole
chores
and
nothing
but
the
chores
after
awhile
he
actually
succeeded
and
when
he
saw
the
headline
in
the
paper
the
next
day
missing
boy
prompts
new
fears
he
thought
about
the
pocket
knife
he
had
thrown
into
the
canal
the
pocket
knife
with
the
initials
ec
scratched
on
the
side
he
thought
about
the
blood
he
had
seen
on
the
grass
and
he
thought
about
those
grooves
which
stopped
at
the
edge
of
the
canal
chapter
the
dam
in
the
barrens
seen
from
the
expressway
at
quarter
to
five
in
the
morning
boston
seems
a
city
of
the
dead
brooding
over
some
tragedy
in
its
past
a
plague
perhaps
or
a
curse
the
smell
of
salt
heavy
and
cloying
comes
off
the
ocean
runners
of
earlymorning
fog
obscure
much
of
what
movement
would
be
seen
otherwise
driving
north
along
storrow
drive
sitting
behind
the
wheel
of
the
black
cadillac
he
picked
up
from
butch
carrington
at
cape
cod
limousine
eddie
kaspbrak
thinks
you
can
feel
this
city
age
perhaps
you
can
get
that
feeling
of
age
nowhere
else
in
america
but
here
boston
is
a
sprat
compared
with
london
an
infant
compared
with
rome
but
by
american
standards
at
least
it
is
old
old
it
kept
its
place
on
these
low
hills
three
hundred
years
ago
when
the
tea
and
stamp
taxes
were
unthought
of
paul
revere
and
patrick
henry
unborn
its
age
its
silence
and
the
foggy
smell
of
the
sea
all
of
these
things
make
eddie
nervous
when
eddie
nervous
he
reaches
for
his
aspirator
he
sticks
it
in
his
mouth
and
triggers
a
cloud
of
revivifying
spray
down
his
throat
there
are
a
few
people
in
the
streets
he
passing
and
a
pedestrian
or
two
on
the
walkways
of
the
overpasses
they
give
lie
to
the
impression
that
he
has
somehow
wandered
into
a
lovecrafty
tale
of
doomed
cities
ancient
evils
and
monsters
with
unpronounceable
names
here
ganged
around
a
bus
stop
with
a
sign
reading
kenmore
square
city
center
he
sees
waitresses
nurses
city
employees
their
faces
naked
and
puffed
with
sleep
that
nght
eddie
thinks
now
passing
under
a
sign
which
reads
tobin
bridge
that
right
stick
to
the
buses
forget
the
subways
the
subways
are
a
bad
idea
i
wouldn't
go
down
there
if
i
were
you
not
down
below
not
in
the
tunnels
this
is
a
bad
thought
to
have
if
he
doesn't
get
rid
of
it
he
will
soon
be
using
the
aspirator
again
he
glad
for
the
heavier
traffic
on
the
tobin
bridge
he
passes
a
monument
works
painted
on
the
brick
side
is
a
slightly
unsettling
admonishment
slow
down
we
can
wait
here
is
a
green
reflectorized
sign
which
reads
to
maine
n.h
all
northern
new
england
points
he
looks
at
it
and
suddenly
a
bonedeep
shudder
wracks
his
body
his
hands
momentarily
weld
themselves
to
the
wheel
of
the
cadillac
he
would
like
to
believe
it
is
the
onset
of
some
sickness
a
virus
or
perhaps
one
of
his
mother
phantom
fevers
but
he
knows
better
it
is
the
city
behind
him
poised
silently
on
the
straightedge
that
runs
between
day
and
night
and
what
that
sign
promises
ahead
of
him
he
sick
all
right
no
doubt
about
that
but
it
not
a
virus
or
a
phantom
fever
he
has
been
poisoned
by
his
own
memories
i'm
scared
eddie
thinks
that
was
always
what
was
at
the
bottom
of
it
just
being
scared
that
was
everything
but
in
the
ad
i
think
we
turned
that
around
somehow
we
used
it
but
how
he
can't
remember
he
wonders
if
any
of
the
others
can
for
all
their
sakes
he
certainly
hopes
so
a
truck
drones
by
on
his
left
eddie
has
still
got
his
lights
on
and
now
he
hits
his
brights
momentarily
as
the
truck
draws
safely
ahead
he
does
this
without
thinking
it
has
become
an
automatic
function
just
part
of
driving
for
a
living
the
unseen
driver
in
the
truck
flashes
his
running
lights
in
return
quickly
twice
thanking
eddie
for
his
courtesy
if
only
everything
could
be
that
simple
and
that
clear
he
thinks
he
follows
the
signs
to
e
the
northbound
traffic
is
light
although
he
observes
that
the
southbound
lanes
into
the
city
are
starting
to
fill
up
even
at
this
early
hour
eddie
floats
the
big
car
along
preguessing
most
of
the
directional
signs
and
getting
into
the
correct
lane
long
before
he
has
to
it
has
been
years
literally
years
since
he
has
guessed
wrong
enough
to
be
swept
past
an
exit
he
wanted
he
makes
his
lanechoices
as
automatically
as
he
flashed
okay
to
cut
back
i
to
the
trucker
as
automatically
as
he
once
found
his
way
through
the
tangle
of
paths
in
the
derry
barrens
the
fact
that
he
has
never
before
in
his
life
driven
out
of
downtown
boston
one
of
the
most
confusing
cities
in
america
to
drive
in
does
not
seem
to
matter
much
at
all
he
suddenly
remembers
something
else
about
that
summer
something
bill
said
to
him
one
day
yyou've
ggot
a
cccuhhompass
in
your
head
eeeddie
how
that
had
pleased
him
it
pleases
him
again
as
the
dorado
shoots
back
onto
the
turnpike
he
slides
the
limo
speed
up
to
a
copsafe
fiftyseven
miles
an
hour
and
finds
some
quiet
music
on
the
radio
he
supposes
he
would
have
died
for
bill
back
then
if
that
had
been
required
if
bill
had
asked
him
eddie
would
simply
have
responded
sure
big
bill
you
got
a
time
in
mind
ye
eddie
laughs
at
this
not
much
of
a
sound
just
a
snort
but
the
sound
of
it
startles
him
into
a
real
laugh
he
laughs
seldom
these
days
and
he
certainly
did
not
expect
to
find
many
chucks
richie
word
meaning
chuckles
as
in
you
had
any
good
chucks
today
eds'
on
this
black
pilgrimage
but
he
supposes
if
god
is
dirtymean
enough
to
curse
the
faithful
with
what
they
want
most
in
life
he
maybe
quirky
enough
to
deal
you
a
good
chuck
or
two
along
the
way
had
any
good
chucks
lately
ed
he
says
out
loud
and
laughs
again
man
he
had
hated
it
when
richie
called
him
eds
but
he
had
sort
of
liked
it
too
the
way
he
thought
ben
hanscom
got
to
like
richie
calling
him
haystack
it
was
something
like
a
secret
name
a
secret
identity
a
way
to
be
people
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
their
parents
fears
hopes
constant
demands
richie
couldn't
do
his
beloved
voices
for
shit
but
maybe
he
did
know
how
important
it
was
for
creeps
like
them
to
sometimes
be
different
people
eddie
glances
at
the
change
lined
up
neatly
on
the
dorado
dashboard
lining
up
the
change
is
another
of
those
automatic
tricks
of
the
trade
when
the
tollbooths
come
up
you
never
want
to
have
to
dig
for
your
silver
never
want
to
find
that
you've
gotten
in
an
automatic
toll
lane
with
the
wrong
change
among
the
coins
are
two
or
three
susan
b
anthony
silver
dollars
they
are
cons
he
reflects
that
you
probably
only
find
in
the
pockets
of
chauffeurs
and
taxidrivers
from
the
new
york
area
these
days
just
as
the
only
place
you
are
apt
to
see
a
lot
of
twodollar
bills
is
at
a
racetrack
payoff
window
he
always
keeps
a
few
on
hand
because
the
robot
tolltaker
baskets
on
the
george
washington
and
the
triboro
bridges
take
them
another
of
those
lights
suddenly
comes
on
in
his
head
silver
dollars
not
these
fake
copper
sandwiches
but
real
silver
dollars
with
lady
liberty
dressed
in
her
gauzy
robes
stamped
upon
them
ben
hanscom’
silver
dollars
yes
but
wasn't
it
bill
who
once
used
one
of
those
silver
cartwheels
to
save
their
lives
he
is
not
quite
sure
of
this
is
in
fact
not
quite
sure
of
anything
or
is
it
just
that
he
doesn't
want
to
remember
it
was
dark
in
there
he
thinks
suddenly
i
remember
that
much
it
was
dark
in
there
boston
is
well
behind
him
now
and
the
fog
is
starting
to
bum
off
ahead
is
maine
n.h
all
northern
new
england
points
derry
is
ahead
and
there
is
something
in
derry
which
should
be
twentyseven
years
dead
and
yet
is
somehow
not
something
with
as
many
faces
as
lon
chaney
but
what
is
it
really
didn't
they
see
it
at
the
end
as
it
really
was
with
all
its
masks
cast
aside
ah
he
can
remember
so
much
but
not
enough
he
remembers
that
he
loved
bill
denbrough
he
remembers
that
well
enough
bill
never
made
fun
of
his
asthma
bill
never
called
him
little
sissy
queerboy
he
loved
bill
like
he
would
have
loved
a
big
brother
or
a
father
bill
knew
stuff
to
do
places
to
go
things
to
see
bill
was
never
up
against
it
when
you
ran
with
bill
you
ran
to
beat
the
devil
and
you
laughed
but
you
hardly
ever
ran
out
of
breath
and
hardly
ever
running
out
of
breath
was
great
so
fucking
great
eddie
would
tell
the
world
when
you
ran
with
big
bill
you
got
your
chucks
every
day
sure
kid
every
da
he
says
in
a
richie
tozier
voice
and
laughs
again
it
had
been
bill
idea
to
make
the
dam
in
the
barrens
and
it
was
in
a
way
the
dam
that
had
brought
them
all
together
ben
hanscom
had
been
the
one
to
show
them
how
the
dam
could
be
built
and
they
had
built
it
so
well
that
they'd
gotten
in
a
lot
of
trouble
with
mr
nell
the
cop
on
the
beat
but
it
had
been
bill
idea
and
although
all
of
them
except
richie
had
seen
very
odd
things
frightening
things
in
derry
since
the
turn
of
the
year
it
had
been
bill
who
had
first
found
the
courage
to
say
something
out
loud
that
dam
that
damn
dam
he
remembered
victor
cris
tata
boys
it
was
a
real
baby
dam
believe
me
you're
better
off
without
it
a
day
later
ben
hanscom
was
grinning
at
them
saying
we
could
we
could
flood
we
could
flood
out
the
whole
barrens
if
we
wanted
to
bill
and
eddie
looked
at
ben
doubtfully
and
then
at
the
stuff
ben
had
brought
along
with
him
some
boards
scrounged
from
mr
mckibbon
back
yard
but
that
was
okay
since
mr
mckkibbon
had
probably
scavenged
them
from
someone
else
a
sledgehammer
a
shovel
dunno
eddie
said
glancing
at
bill
when
we
tried
yesterday
it
didn't
work
very
good
the
current
kept
washing
our
sticks
away
this'll
wor
ben
said
he
also
looked
to
bill
for
the
final
decision
well

stanley
who
ben
asked
uris
eddie
said
he
was
still
looking
cautiously
at
bill
who
seemed
somehow
different
today
quieter
less
enthusiastic
about
the
idea
of
the
dam
bill
looked
pale
today
distant
stanley
uris
i
guess
i
don't
know
him
does
he
go
to
derry
elementary
he
our
age
but
he
just
finished
the
fourth
grade
eddie
said
he
started
school
a
year
late
because
he
was
sick
a
lot
when
he
was
a
little
kid
you
think

paused
and
then
said
carefully

like

turkish
or
is
it
more
like
you
know
egyptian
i
g
guess

more
like
turhurhurkis
bill
said
he
picked
up
one
of
the
boards
ben
had
brought
and
looked
at
it
it
was
about
six
feet
long
and
three
feet
wide
my
dddad
says
most
jjews
have
big
nub
noses
and
lots
of
mmmoney
but
stuhstuhstuh
but
stan
got
a
regular
nose
and
he
always
broke
eddie
said
yea
bill
said
and
broke
into
a
real
grin
for
the
first
time
that
day
ben
grinned
eddie
grinned
bill
tossed
the
board
aside
got
up
and
brushed
off
the
seat
of
his
jeans
he
walked
to
the
edge
of
the
stream
and
the
other
two
boys
joined
him
bill
shoved
his
hands
in
his
back
pockets
and
sighed
deeply
eddie
was
sure
bill
was
going
to
say
something
serious
he
looked
from
eddie
to
ben
and
then
back
to
eddie
again
not
smiling
now
eddie
was
suddenly
afraid
but
all
bill
said
then
was
you
got
your
ahah
aspirator
eeddi
eddie
slapped
his
pocket
i'm
loaded
for
bear
say
how'd
it
work
with
the
chocolate
milk
ben
asked
eddie
laughed
worked
great
he
said
he
and
ben
broke
up
while
bill
looked
at
them
smiling
but
puzzled
eddie
explained
and
bill
nodded
grinning
again
eeeddie
muhhum
is
wwworried
that
hhe
¢gonna
break
and
shshe
wuhhon't
be
able
to
œ
get
a
rererefund
eddie
snorted
and
made
as
if
to
push
him
into
the
stream
watch
it
fuckface
bill
said
sounding
uncannily
like
henry
bowers
tii
twist
your
head
so
far
around
you'll
be
able
to
watch
when
you
wipe
yourself
ben
collapsed
shrieking
with
laughter
bill
glanced
at
him
still
smiling
hands
still
in
the
back
pockets
of
his
jeans
smiling
yeah
but
a
little
distant
again
a
little
vague
he
looked
at
eddie
and
then
cocked
his
head
toward
ben
kid
suhsuh
soft
he
said
yea
eddie
agreed
but
he
felt
somehow
that
they
were
only
going
through
the
motions
of
having
a
good
time
something
was
on
bill
mind
he
supposed
bill
would
spill
it
when
he
was
ready
the
question
was
did
eddie
want
to
hear
what
it
was
kid
mentally
retarded
retreade
ben
said
still
giggling
yyou
gggonna
shshow
us
how
to
bbuild
a
dam
or
aare
you
g
gonna
sthit
there
on
your
bbig
cccan
all
dday
ben
got
to
his
feet
again
he
looked
first
at
the
stream
flowing
past
them
at
moderate
speed
the
kenduskeag
was
not
terribly
wide
this
far
up
in
the
barrens
but
it
had
defeated
them
yesterday
just
the
same
neither
eddie
nor
bill
had
been
able
to
figure
out
how
to
get
a
foothold
on
the
current
but
ben
was
smiling
the
smile
of
one
who
contemplates
doing
something
new
something
that
will
be
fun
but
not
very
hard
eddie
thought
he
knows
how
i
really
think
he
does
okay
he
said
you
guys
want
to
take
your
shoes
off
because
you're
gonna
get
your
little
footsies
wet
the
mindmother
in
eddie
head
spoke
up
at
once
her
voice
as
stern
and
commanding
as
the
voice
of
a
traffic
cop
don't
you
dare
do
it
eddie
don't
you
dare
wet
feet
that
one
way
one
of
the
thousands
of
ways
that
colds
start
and
colds
lead
to
pneumonia
so
don't
you
do
it
bill
and
ben
were
sitting
on
the
bank
pulling
off
their
sneakers
and
socks
ben
was
fussily
rolling
up
the
legs
of
his
jeans
bill
looked
up
at
eddie
his
eyes
were
clear
and
warm
sympathetic
eddie
was
suddenly
sure
big
bill
knew
exactly
what
he
had
been
thinking
and
he
was
ashamed
yyou
cccomi
yeah
sure
eddie
said
he
sat
down
on
the
bank
and
undressed
his
feet
while
his
mother
ranted
inside
his
head
but
her
voice
was
growing
steadily
more
distant
and
echoey
he
was
relieved
to
note
as
if
someone
had
stuck
a
heavy
fishhook
through
the
back
of
her
blouse
and
was
now
reeling
her
away
from
him
down
a
very
long
corridor
it
was
one
of
those
perfect
summer
days
which
in
a
world
where
everything
was
on
track
and
on
the
beam
you
would
never
forget
a
moderate
breeze
kept
the
worst
of
the
mosquitoes
and
blackflies
away
the
sky
was
a
bright
crisp
blue
temperatures
were
in
the
low
seventies
birds
sang
and
went
about
their
birdybusiness
in
the
bushes
ad
second
growth
trees
eddie
had
to
use
his
aspirator
once
and
then
his
chest
lightened
and
his
throat
seemed
to
widen
magically
to
the
size
of
a
freeway
he
spent
the
rest
of
the
morning
with
it
stuffed
forgotten
into
his
back
pocket
ben
hanscom
who
had
seemed
so
timid
and
unsure
the
day
before
became
a
confident
general
once
he
was
fully
involved
in
the
actual
construction
of
the
dam
every
now
and
then
he
would
climb
the
bank
and
stand
there
with
his
muddy
hands
on
his
hips
looking
at
the
work
in
progress
and
muttering
to
himself
sometimes
he
would
run
a
hand
through
his
hair
and
by
eleven
o'clock
it
was
standing
up
in
crazy
comical
spikes
eddie
felt
uncertainty
at
first
then
a
sense
of
glee
and
finally
an
entirely
new
feeling
one
that
was
at
the
same
time
weird
terrifying
and
exhilarating
it
was
a
feeling
so
alien
to
his
usual
state
of
being
that
he
was
not
able
to
put
a
name
to
it
until
that
night
lying
in
bed
and
looking
at
the
ceiling
and
replaying
the
day
power
that
was
what
that
feeling
had
been
power
it
was
going
to
work
by
god
and
it
was
going
to
work
better
than
he
and
bill
maybe
even
ben
himself
had
dreamed
it
could
he
could
see
bill
getting
involved
too
only
a
little
at
first
still
mulling
over
whatever
it
was
he
had
on
his
mind
and
then
bit
by
bit
committing
himself
fully
once
or
twice
he
clapped
ben
on
one
meaty
shoulder
and
told
him
he
was
unbelievable
ben
flushed
with
pleasure
each
time
ben
got
eddie
and
bill
to
set
one
of
the
boards
across
the
stream
and
hold
it
as
he
used
the
sledgehammer
to
seat
it
in
the
streambed
there
it
in
but
you'll
have
to
hold
it
or
the
current'll
just
pull
it
loose
he
told
eddie
so
eddie
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
stream
holding
the
board
while
water
sluiced
over
its
top
and
made
his
hands
into
wavering
starfish
shapes
ben
and
bill
located
a
second
board
two
feet
downstream
of
the
first
ben
used
the
sledge
again
to
seat
it
and
bill
held
it
while
ben
began
to
fill
up
the
space
between
the
two
boards
with
sandy
earth
from
the
streambank
at
first
it
only
washed
away
around
the
ends
of
the
boards
in
gritty
clouds
and
eddie
didn't
think
it
was
going
to
work
at
all
but
when
ben
began
adding
rocks
and
muddy
gook
from
the
streambed
the
clouds
of
escaping
silt
began
to
diminish
in
less
than
twenty
minutes
he
had
created
a
heaped
brown
canal
of
earth
and
stones
between
the
two
boards
in
the
middle
of
the
stream
to
eddie
it
looked
like
an
optical
illusion
if
we
had
real
cement
instead
of
just
mud
and
rocks
they'd
have
to
move
the
whole
city
over
to
the
old
cape
side
by
the
middle
of
next
wee
ben
said
slinging
the
shovel
aside
at
last
and
sitting
on
the
bank
until
he
got
his
breath
back
bill
and
eddie
laughed
and
ben
grinned
at
them
when
he
grinned
there
was
a
ghost
of
the
handsome
man
he
would
become
in
the
lines
of
his
face
water
had
begun
to
pile
up
behind
the
upstream
board
now
eddie
asked
what
they
were
going
to
do
about
the
water
escaping
around
the
sides
letit
go
it
doesn't
matter
it
doesn't
nope
why
not
i
can't
explain
exactly
you
gotta
let
some
out
though
how
do
you
know
ben
shrugged
j
just
do
the
shrug
said
and
eddie
was
silenced
when
he
was
rested
ben
got
a
third
board
the
thickest
of
the
four
or
five
he
had
carried
laboriously
across
town
to
the
barrens
and
placed
it
carefully
against
the
downstream
board
wedging
one
end
firmly
into
the
streambed
and
socking
the
other
against
the
board
bill
had
been
holding
creating
the
strut
he
had
put
in
his
little
drawing
the
day
before
okay
he
said
standing
back
he
grinned
at
them
you
guys
should
be
able
to
let
go
now
the
gook
in
between
the
two
boards
will
take
most
of
the
water
pressure
the
strut
will
take
the
rest
won't
the
water
wash
it
awa
eddie
asked
nope
the
water
is
just
gonna
push
it
in
deeper
and
if
you're
rub
ruh
wrong
we
œ
get
to
kkkill
yuh
you
bill
said
that
coo
ben
said
amiably
bill
and
eldie
stepped
back
the
two
boards
that
formed
the
basis
of
the
dam
creaked
a
little
tilted
a
little
and
that
was
all
hot
shit
eddie
screamed
excited
it
gggrea
bill
said
grinning
yea
ben
said
let
eat
they
sat
on
the
bank
and
ate
not
talking
much
watching
the
water
stack
up
behind
the
dam
and
sluice
around
the
ends
of
the
boards
they
had
already
done
something
to
the
geography
of
the
streambanks
eddie
saw
the
diverted
current
was
cutting
scalloped
hollows
into
them
as
he
watched
the
new
course
of
the
stream
undercut
the
bank
enough
on
the
far
side
to
cause
a
small
avalanche
upstream
of
the
dam
the
water
formed
a
roughly
circular
pool
and
at
one
place
it
had
actually
overflowed
the
bank
bright
reflecting
rills
ran
off
into
the
grass
and
the
underbrush
eddie
slowly
began
to
realize
what
ben
had
known
from
the
first
the
dam
was
already
built
the
gaps
between
the
boards
and
the
banks
were
sluiceways
ben
had
not
been
able
to
tell
eddie
this
because
he
did
not
know
the
word
above
the
boards
the
kenduskeag
had
taken
on
a
swelled
look
the
chuckling
sound
of
shallow
water
babbling
its
way
over
stones
and
gravel
was
now
gone
all
the
stones
upstream
of
the
dam
were
underwater
every
now
and
then
more
sod
and
dirt
undercut
by
the
widening
stream
would
fall
into
the
water
with
a
splash
downstream
of
the
dam
the
watercourse
was
nearly
empty
thin
trickles
ran
restlessly
down
its
center
but
that
was
about
all
stones
which
had
been
underwater
for
god
knew
how
long
were
drying
in
the
sun
eddie
looked
at
these
drying
stones
with
mild
wonder
and
that
weird
other
feeling
they
had
done
this
they
he
saw
a
frog
hopping
along
and
thought
maybe
old
mr
froggy
was
wondering
just
where
the
water
had
gone
eddie
laughed
out
loud
ben
was
neatly
stowing
his
empty
wrappers
in
the
lunchbag
he
had
brought
both
eddie
and
bill
had
been
amazed
by
the
size
of
the
repast
ben
had
laid
out
with
businesslike
efficiency
two
pb&ampj
sandwiches
one
baloney
sandwich
a
hardcooked
egg
complete
with
a
pinch
of
salt
twisted
up
in
a
small
piece
of
waxed
paper
two
figbars
three
large
chocolate
chip
cookies
and
a
ring
ding
what
did
your
ma
say
when
she
saw
how
bad
you
got
racked
eddie
asked
him
hmmmm
ben
looked
up
from
the
spreading
pool
of
water
behind
the
dam
and
belched
gently
against
the
back
of
his
hand
oh
well
i
knew
she'd
be
groceryshopping
yesterday
afternoon
so
i
was
able
to
beat
her
home
i
took
a
bath
and
washed
my
hair
then
i
threw
away
the
jeans
and
the
sweatshirt
i
was
wearing
i
don't
know
if
she'll
notice
they're
gone
or
not
probably
not
the
sweatshirt
i
got
lots
of
sweatshirts
but
i
guess
i
ought
to
buy
myself
a
new
pair
of
jeans
before
she
gets
nosing
through
my
drawers
the
thought
of
wasting
his
money
on
such
a
nonessential
item
cast
momentary
gloom
across
ben
face
w
w
what
about
the
way
yuhyou
wwere
bbruised
up
i
told
her
i
was
so
excited
to
be
out
of
school
that
i
ran
out
the
door
and
fell
down
the
steps
ben
said
and
looked
both
amazed
and
a
little
hurt
when
eddie
and
bill
began
laughing
bill
who
had
been
chowing
up
a
piece
of
his
mother’s
devil
food
cake
blew
out
a
brown
jet
of
crumbs
and
then
had
a
coughing
fit
eddie
still
howling
clapped
him
on
the
back
well
i
almost
did
fall
down
the
steps
ben
said
only
it
was
because
victor
criss
pushed
me
not
because
i
was
running
i'd
be
as
khot
as
a
tuhtuhtamale
in
a
swubheatshirt
like
that
bill
said
finishing
the
last
bite
of
his
cake
ben
hesitated
for
a
moment
it
seemed
he
would
say
nothing
it
better
when
you're
fa
he
said
finally
sweatshirts
i
mean
because
of
your
gut
eddie
asked
bill
snorted
because
of
your
tih
tih
tih
yeah
my
tits
so
what
yeah
bill
said
mildly
sso
what
there
was
a
moment
of
awkward
silence
and
then
eddie
said
look
how
dark
the
water
getting
when
it
goes
around
that
side
of
the
dam
oh
cripe
ben
shot
to
his
feet
current
pulling
out
the
fill
jeez
i
wish
we
had
cement
the
damage
was
quickly
repaired
but
even
eddie
could
see
what
would
happen
without
someone
there
to
almost
constantly
shovel
in
fresh
fill
erosion
would
eventually
cause
the
upstream
board
to
collapse
against
the
downstream
board
and
then
everything
would
fall
over
we
can
shore
up
the
sides
ben
said
that
won't
stop
the
erosion
but
it'll
slow
it
down
if
we
use
sand
and
mud
won't
it
just
go
on
washing
away
eddie
asked
we'll
use
chunks
of
sod
bill
nodded
smiled
and
made
an
o
with
the
thumb
and
forefinger
of
his
right
hand
let
g
ggo
i'll
ddig
em
and
yyou
shshow
me
where
to
pput
em
ihin
big
ben
from
behind
them
a
stridently
cheery
voice
called
my
gawd
someone
put
the
ypool
down
in
the
barrens
bellybutton
lint
and
all
eddie
turned
noticing
the
way
ben
tightened
up
at
the
sound
of
a
strange
voice
the
way
his
lips
thinned
standing
above
them
and
aways
upstream
on
the
path
ben
had
crossed
the
day
before
were
richie
tozier
and
stanley
uris
richie
came
bopping
down
to
the
stream
glanced
at
ben
with
some
interest
and
then
pinched
eddie
check
don't
do
that
i
hate
it
when
you
do
that
richie
ah
you
love
it
eds
richie
said
and
beamed
at
him
so
what
do
you
say
you
havin
any
good
chucks
or
what
the
five
of
them
knocked
off
around
four
o'clock
they
sat
much
higher
on
the
bank
the
place
where
bill
ben
and
eddie
had
eaten
lunch
was
now
underwater
and
stared
down
at
ther
handiwork
even
ben
found
it
a
little
difficult
to
believe
he
felt
a
sense
of
tired
accomplishment
which
was
mixed
with
uneasy
fright
he
found
himself
thinking
of
fantasia
and
how
mickey
mouse
had
known
enough
to
get
the
brooms
started
but
not
mough
to
make
them
stop
fucking
incredible
richie
tozier
said
softly
and
pushed
his
glasses
up
on
his
nose
eddie
glanced
over
at
him
but
richie
was
not
doing
one
of
his
numbers
now
his
face
was
thoughtful
almost
solemn
on
the
far
side
of
the
stream
where
the
land
first
rose
and
then
tilted
shallowly
downhill
they
had
created
a
new
piece
of
bogland
bracken
and
holly
bushes
stood
in
a
foot
of
water
even
as
they
sat
here
they
could
see
the
bog
sending
out
fresh
pseudopods
spreading
seadily
westward
behind
the
dam
the
kenduskeag
shallow
and
harmless
just
this
morning
had
become
a
still
swollen
band
of
water
by
two
o'clock
the
widening
pool
behind
the
dam
had
taken
so
much
embankment
that
the
spillways
had
grown
almost
to
the
size
of
rivers
themselves
everyone
but
ben
had
gone
on
an
emergency
expedition
to
the
dump
in
search
of
more
materials
ben
stuck
around
methodically
sodding
up
leaks
the
scavengers
had
returned
not
only
with
boards
but
with
four
bald
tires
the
rusty
door
of
a
hudson
hornet
and
a
big
piece
of
corrugated
steel
siding
under
ben
leadership
they
had
built
two
wings
on
the
original
dam
blocking
off
the
water
escape
around
the
sides
again
and
with
the
wings
raked
back
at
an
angle
against
the
current
the
dam
worked
even
better
than
before
stopped
that
sucker
col
richie
said
you're
a
genius
man
ben
smiled
it
not
so
much
i
got
some
winstons
richie
said
who
wants
one
he
produced
the
crumpled
redandwhite
pack
from
his
pants
pocket
and
passed
it
around
eddie
thinking
of
the
hell
a
cigarette
would
raise
with
his
asthma
refused
stan
also
refused
bill
took
one
and
after
a
moment
thought
ben
took
one
too
richie
produced
a
book
of
matches
with
the
words
roitan
on
the
outside
and
lit
first
ben
cigarette
then
bill
he
was
about
to
light
his
own
when
bill
blew
out
the
match
thanks
a
lot
denbrough
you
we
richie
said
bill
smiled
apologetically
thethethree
on
a
muh
mulrhatch
he
said
bbad
luhluh
luck
bad
luck
for
your
folks
when
you
were
born
richie
said
and
lit
his
cigarette
with
another
match
he
lay
down
and
crossed
his
arms
beneath
his
head
the
cigarette
jutted
upward
between
his
teeth
winston
tastes
good
like
a
cigarette
should
he
turned
his
head
slightly
and
winked
at
eddie
ain't
that
right
eds
ben
eddie
saw
was
looking
at
richie
with
a
mixture
of
awe
and
wariness
eddie
could
understand
that
he
had
known
richie
tozier
for
four
years
and
he
still
didn't
really
understand
what
richie
was
about
he
knew
that
richie
got
a
and
b
in
his
schoolwork
but
he
also
knew
that
richie
regularly
got
c
and
d
in
deportment
his
father
really
racked
him
about
it
and
his
mother
just
about
cried
every
time
richie
brought
home
those
poor
conduct
grades
and
richie
would
swear
to
do
better
and
maybe
he
even
would
for
a
quarter
or
two
the
trouble
with
richie
was
that
he
couldn't
keep
still
for
more
than
a
minute
at
a
time
and
he
couldn't
keep
his
mouth
shut
at
all
down
here
in
the
barrens
that
didn't
get
him
in
much
trouble
but
the
barrens
weren't
nevernever
land
and
they
couldn't
be
the
wild
boys
for
more
than
a
few
hours
at
a
stretch
the
idea
of
a
wild
boy
with
an
aspirator
in
his
back
pocket
made
eddie
smile
the
trouble
with
the
barrens
was
that
you
always
had
to
leave
out
there
in
the
wider
world
richie
bullshit
was
always
getting
him
in
trouble
with
adults
which
was
bad
and
with
guys
like
henry
bowers
which
was
even
worse
his
entrance
earlier
today
was
a
perfect
example
ben
hanscom
had
no
more
than
started
to
say
in
when
richie
had
fallen
on
his
knees
at
ben
feet
he
then
began
a
series
of
gigantic
salaams
his
arms
outstretched
his
hands
fwapping
against
the
muddy
bank
every
time
he
bowed
again
at
the
same
time
he
had
begun
to
speak
in
one
of
his
voices
richie
had
about
a
dozen
different
voices
his
ambition
he
had
told
eddie
one
rainy
afternoon
when
they
were
in
the
little
raftered
room
over
the
kaspbrak
garage
reading
little
lulu
comic
books
was
to
become
the
world
greatest
ventriloquist
he
was
going
to
be
even
greater
than
edgar
bergen
he
said
and
he
would
be
on
the
ed
sullivan
show
every
week
eddie
admired
this
ambition
but
foresaw
problems
with
it
first
ail
of
richie
voices
sounded
pretty
much
like
richie
tozier
this
was
not
to
say
richie
could
not
be
very
funny
from
time
to
time
he
could
be
when
referring
to
verbal
zingers
and
loud
farts
richie
terminology
was
the
same
he
called
it
getting
off
a
good
one
and
he
got
off
good
ones
of
both
types
frequently
usually
in
inappropriate
company
however
second
when
richie
did
ventriloquism
his
lips
moved
not
just
a
little
on
the
and
sounds
but
a
lot
and
on
all
the
sounds
third
when
richie
said
he
was
going
to
throw
his
voice
it
usually
didn't
go
very
far
most
of
his
friends
were
too
kind
or
too
bemused
with
richie
sometimes
enchanting
often
exhausting
charm
to
mention
these
little
failings
to
him
salaaming
frantically
in
front
of
the
startled
and
embarrassed
ben
hanscom
richie
was
speaking
in
what
he
called
his
nigger
jim

lawksamussy
it

he
popped
his

out
thoroughly
confused
ben
reached
for

richie
pulled
his
hand
back
ben
bunked
relenting
richie
shook
my

ben
hanscom
in

richie
said
he
swept
a
hand
at
the
spreading
pool
of
water
this
must
have
been
your
idea
these
wet
ends
couldn't
light
a
firecracker
with
a
flamethrower

richie
eddie
said
oh
you
mean
it
was
your
idea
eds
jesus
i'm
sorry
he
fell
down
in
front
of
eddie
and
began
salaaming
wildly
again
get
up
stop
it
you're
splattering
mud
on
me
eddie
cried
richie
jumped
to
his
feet
a
second
time
and
pinched
eddie
cheek
cute
cute
cut
richie
exclaimed
stop

i
hate
that
fess
up
eds
who
built
the
dam
bbben
sh
showed
u
bill
said
good
deal
richie
turned
and
discovered
stanley
uris
standing
behind
him
hands
in
his
pockets
watching
quietly
as
richie
put
on
his
show
this
here
stan
the
man
uris
richie
told
ben
stan
a
jew
also
he
killed
christ
at
least
that
what
victor
criss
told
me
one
day
i
been
after
stan
ever
since
i
figure
if
he
that
old
he
ought
to
be
able
to
buy
us
some
beer
right
stan
think
that
must
have
been
my
father
stan
said
in
a
low
pleasant
voice
and
that
broke
them
all
up
ben
included
eddie
laughed
until
he
was
wheezing
and
tears
were
running
down
his
face
a
good
one
richie
cried
striding
around
with
his
arms
thrown
up
over
his
head
like
a
football
referee
signalling
that
the
extra
point
was
good
stan
the
man
gets
off
a
good
one
great
moments
in
history
yowza
yowza
yowz
stan
said
to
ben
seeming
to
take
no
notice
of
richie
at
all
hello
ben
replied
we
were
in
the
same
class
in
second
grade
you
were
the
kid
who
never
said
anything
stan
finished
smiling
a
little
right
stan
wouldn't
say
shit
if
he
had
a
mouthful
richie
said
which
he
freequently
does
yowza
yowza
yow
sh
sh
shut
uhup
richie
bill
said
okay
but
first
i
have
to
tell
you
one
more
thing
much
as
i
hate
to
i
think
you're
losing
your
dam
valley
gonna
flood
pardners
let
get
the
women
and
children
out
first
and
without
bothering
to
roll
up
his
pants
or
even
to
remove
his
sneakers
richie
jumped
into
the
water
and
began
to
slam
sods
into
place
on
the
nearside
wing
of
the
dam
where
the
persistent
current
was
pulling
fill
out
in
muddy
streamers
again
a
piece
of
red
cross
adhesive
tape
was
wrapped
around
one
of
the
bows
of
his
glasses
and
the
loose
end
flapped
against
his
cheekbone
as
he
worked
bill
caught
eddie
eye
smiled
a
little
and
shrugged
it
was
just
richie
he
could
drive
you
bugshit
but
it
was
still
sort
of
nice
to
have
him
around
they
worked
on
the
dam
for
the
next
hour
or
so
richie
took
ben
commands
which
had
become
rather
tentative
again
with
two
more
kids
to
general
with
perfect
willingness
and
fulfilled
them
at
a
manic
pace
when
each
mission
was
completed
he
reported
back
to
ben
for
further
orders
executing
a
backhand
british
salute
and
snapping
the
soggy
heels
of
his
sneakers
together
every
now
and
then
he
would
begin
to
harangue
the
others
in
one
of
his
voices
the
german
commandant
toodles
the
english
butler
the
southern
senator
who
sounded
quite
a
bit
like
foghorn
leghorn
and
who
would
in
the
fullness
of
time
evolve
into
a
character
named
buford
kissdrivel
the
movietone
newsreel
narrator
the
work
did
not
just
go
forward
it
sprinted
forward
and
now
shortly
before
five
o'clock
as
they
sat
resting
on
the
bank
it
seemed
that
what
richie
had
said
was
true
they
had
stopped
the
sucker
cold
the
car
door
the
piece
of
corrugated
steel
and
the
old
tires
had
become
the
second
stage
of
the
dam
and
it
was
backstopped
by
a
huge
sloping
hill
of
earth
and
stones
bill
ben
and
richie
smoked
stan
was
lying
on
his
back
a
stranger
might
have
thought
he
was
just
looking
at
the
sky
but
eddie
knew
better
stan
was
looking
into
the
trees
on
the
other
side
of
the
stream
keeping
an
eye
out
for
a
bird
or
two
he
could
write
up
in
his
bird
notebook
that
night
eddie
himself
just
sat
crosslegged
feeling
pleasantly
tired
and
rather
mellow
at
that
moment
the
others
seemed
to
him
like
the
greatest
bunch
of
guys
to
chum
with
a
fellow
could
ever
hope
to
have
they
felt
right
together
they
fitted
neatly
against
each
other
edges
he
couldn't
explain
it
to
himself
any
better
than
that
and
since
it
didn't
really
seem
to
need
any
explaining
he
decided
he
ought
to
just
let
it
be
he
looked
over
at
ben
who
was
holding
his
halfsmoked
cigarette
clumsily
and
spitting
frequently
as
if
he
didn't
like
the
taste
of
it
much
as
eddie
watched
ben
stubbed
it
out
and
covered
the
long
butt
with
dirt
ben
looked
up
saw
eddie
watching
him
and
looked
away
embarrassed
eddie
glanced
at
bill
and
saw
something
on
bill
face
that
he
didn't
like
bill
was
looking
across
the
water
and
into
the
trees
and
bushes
on
the
far
side
his
eyes
gray
and
thoughtful
that
brooding
expression
was
back
on
his
face
eddie
thought
bill
looked
almost
haunted
as
if
reading
his
thought
bill
looked
around
at
him
eddie
smiled
but
bill
didn't
smile
back
he
put
his
cigarette
out
and
looked
around
at
the
others
even
richie
had
withdrawn
into
the
silence
of
his
own
thoughts
an
event
which
occurred
about
as
seldom
as
a
lunar
eclipse
eddie
knew
that
bill
rarely
said
anything
important
unless
it
was
perfectly
quiet
because
it
was
so
hard
for
him
to
speak
and
he
suddenly
wished
he
had
something
to
say
or
that
richie
would
start
in
with
one
of
his
voices
he
was
suddenly
sure
bill
was
going
to
open
his
mouth
and
say
something
terrible
something
which
would
change
everything
eddie
reached
automatically
for
his
aspirator
pulled
it
out
of
his
back
pocket
and
held
it
in
his
hand
he
did
this
without
even
thinking
about
it
ccan
i
tell
you
ggguys
suhhomething
bill
asked
they
all
looked
at
him
crack
a
joke

eddie

really
outrageous
embarrass
him
i
don't
care
just

him
up
whatever
it
is
i
don't
want
to
hear
it
i
don't
want
things
to
change
i
don't
want
to
be
scared
in
his
mind
a
tenebrous
croaking
voice
whispered
i'l]
do
it
for
a
dime
eddie
shuddered
and
tried
to
unthink
that
voice
and
the
sudden
image
i
called
up
in
his
mind
the
house
on
neibolt
street
its
front
yard
overgrown
with
weeds
gigantic
sunflowers
nodding
in
the
untended
garden
off
to
one
side
sure
big
bill
richie
said
what
up
bill
opened
his
mouth
more
anxiety
on
eddie
part
closed
it
blessed
relief
for
eddie
and
then
opened
it
again
renewed
anxiety
leif
you
guhguhguys
}llaugh
fi'll
never
hhang
around
with
you
again
bill
said
it
cuhcuhcrazy
but
i
swear
i'm
not
muhhaking
it
up
it
rrreally
happened
we
won't
laugh
ben
said
he
looked
around
at
the
others
will
we
stan
shook
his
head
so
did
richie
eddie
wanted
to
say
yes
we
will
too
billy
we'll
laugh
our
heads
off
and
say
you're
really
stupid
so
why
don't
you
shut
up
right
now
but
of
course
he
could
not
say
any
such
thing
this
was
after
all
big
bill
he
shook
his
head
miserably
no
he
wouldn't
laugh
he
had
never
felt
less
like
laughing
in
his
life
they
sat
there
above
the
dam
ben
had
showed
them
how
to
make
looking
from
bill
face
to
the
expanding
pool
and
the
likewise
expanding
bog
beyond
it
and
then
back
to
bill
face
again
listening
silently
as
he
told
them
about
what
had
happened
when
he
opened
george
photograph
album
how
georgie
school
photograph
had
turned
its
head
and
winked
at
him
how
the
book
had
bled
when
he
threw
it
across
the
room
it
was
a
long
painful
recital
and
by
the
time
he
finished
bill
was
redfaced
and
sweating
eddie
had
never
heard
him
stutter
so
badly
at
last
though
the
tale
was
told
bill
looked
around
at
them
both
defiant
and
afraid
eddie
saw
an
identical
expression
on
the
faces
of
ben
richie
and
stan
it
was
solemn
awed
fear
it
was
not
in
the
slightest
tinctured
by
disbelief
an
urge
came
to
him
then
an
uge
to
spring
to
his
feet
and
shout
what
a
crazy
story
you
don't
believe
that
crazy
story
do
you
and
even
if
you
do
you
don't
believe
we
believe
it
do
you
school
pictures
can't
wink
books
can't
bleed
you're
out
of
your
mind
big
bill
but
he
couldn't
very
well
do
so
because
that
expression
of
solemn
fear
was
also
on
his
own
face
he
couldn't
see
it
but
he
could
feel
it
come
back
here
kid
the
hoarse
voice
whispered
i'll
blow
you
for
free
come
back
here
no
eddie
moaned
at
it
please
go
away
i
don't
want
to
think
about
that
come
back
here
kid
and
now
eddie
saw
something
else
not
on
richie
face
at
least
he
didn't
think
so
but
on
stan
and
ben
for
sure
he
knew
what
that
something
else
was
knew
because
that
expression
was
on
his
own
face
too
recognition
tu
blow
you
for
free
the
house
at
neibolt
street
was
just
outside
the
derry
trainyards
it
was
old
and
boarded
up
its
porch
gradually
sinking
back
into
the
ground
its
lawn
an
overgrown
fiel
an
old
trike
rusting
and
overturned
hid
in
that
long
grass
one
wheel
sticking
up
at
an
angle
but
on
the
left
side
of
the
porch
there
was
a
huge
bald
patch
in
the
lawn
and
you
could
see
dirty
cellar
windows
set
into
the
house
crumbling
brick
foundation
it
was
in
one
of
those
windows
that
eddie
kaspbrak
first
saw
the
face
of
the
leper
six
weeks
ago
on
saturdays
when
eddie
could
find
no
one
to
play
with
he
often
went
down
to
the
trainyards
no
real
reason
he
just
liked
to
go
out
there
he
would
ride
his
bike
out
witcham
street
and
then
cut
to
the
northwest
along
route
where
it
crossed
witcham
the
neibolt
street
church
school
stood
on
the
corner
of
route
and
neibolt
street
a
mile
or
so
farther
on
it
was
a
shabbyneat
woodframe
building
with
a
large
cross
on
top
and
the
words
suffer
the
little
children
to
come
unto
me
written
over
the
front
door
in
gilt
letters
two
feet
high
sometimes
on
saturdays
eddie
heard
music
and
singing
coming
from
inside
it
was
gospel
music
but
whoever
was
playing
the
piano
sounded
more
like
jerry
lee
lewis
than
a
regular
church
piano
player
the
singing
didn't
sound
very
religious
to
eddie
either
although
there
was
lots
of
stuff
in
it
about
beautiful
zio
and
being
washed
in
the
blood
of
the
lamb
and
what
a
friend
we
have
in
jesus
the
people
singing
seemed
to
be
having
much
too
good
a
time
for
it
to
really
be
sacred
singing
in
eddie
opinion
but
he
liked
the
sound
of
it
all
the
same
the
way
he
liked
to
hear
jerry
lee
hollering
out
whole
lotta
shakin
goi
on
sometimes
he
would
stop
for
awhile
across
the
street
leaning
his
bike
against
a
tree
and
pretending
to
read
on
the
grass
actually
jiving
along
to
the
music
other
saturdays
the
church
school
would
be
shut
up
and
silent
and
he
would
ride
out
to
the
trainyard
without
stopping
out
to
where
neibolt
street
ended
in
a
parking
lot
with
weeds
growing
up
through
the
cracks
in
the
asphalt
there
he
would
lean
his
bike
against
the
wooden
fence
and
watch
the
trains
go
by
there
were
a
lot
of
them
on
saturdays
his
mother
told
him
that
in
the
old
days
you
could
catch
a
gs&ampwm
passenger
train
at
what
was
then
neibolt
street
station
but
the
passenger
trains
had
stopped
running
around
the
time
the
korean
war
was
starting
up
if
you
got
on
the
northbound
train
you
went
to
brownsville
station
she
said
and
from
brownsville
you
could
catch
a
train
that
would
take
you
all
the
way
across
canada
if
you
wanted
all
the
way
to
the
pacific
the
southbound
tram
would
take
you
to
portland
and
then
on
down
to
boston
and
from
south
station
the
country
was
yours
but
the
passenger
trains
have
gone
the
way
of
the
trolley
lines
now
i
guess
no
one
wants
to
ride
a
train
when
they
can
just
jump
in
a
ford
and
go
you
may
never
even
ride
one
but
great
long
freights
still
came
through
derry
they
headed
south
loaded
down
with
pulpwood
paper
and
potatoes
and
north
with
manufactured
goods
for
those
towns
of
what
maine
people
sometimes
called
the
big
northern
bangor
millinocket
machias
presque
isle
houlton
eddie
particularly
liked
to
watch
the
northbound
carcarriers
with
their
loads
of
gleaming
fords
and
chevies
t'u
have
me
a
car
like
one
of
those
someday
he
promised
himself
like
one
of
those
or
even
better
maybe
even
a
cadillac
there
were
six
tracks
in
all
swooping
into
the
station
like
strands
of
cobweb
tending
toward
the
center
bangor
and
great
northern
lines
from
the
north
the
great
southern
and
western
maine
from
the
west
the
boston
and
maine
from
the
south
and
southern
seacoast
from
the
east
one
day
two
years
before
when
eddie
had
been
standing
near
the
latter
line
and
watching
a
train
go
through
a
drunken
trainman
had
thrown
a
crate
out
of
a
slowmoving
boxcar
at
mm
eddie
ducked
and
flinched
backward
although
the
crate
landed
in
the
cinders
ten
feet
away
there
were
things
inside
it
live
things
that
clicked
and
moved
last
ran
bo
the
drunken
trainman
had
shouted
he
pulled
a
flat
brown
bottle
from
one
of
the
pockets
of
his
denim
jacket
tipped
it
up
drank
then
flipped
it
into
the
cinders
where
it
smashed
the
trainman
pointed
at
the
crate
take
em
home
to
yer
mum
compliments
of
the
southern
fuckingseacoastboundfor
welfare
line
he
had
reeled
forward
to
shout
these
last
words
as
the
train
pulled
away
gathering
speed
now
and
for
one
alarming
moment
eddie
thought
he
was
going
to
tumble
right
out
when
the
train
was
gone
eddie
went
to
the
box
and
bent
cautiously
over
it
he
was
afraid
to
get
too
close
the
things
inside
were
slithery
and
crawly
if
the
tainman
had
yelled
that
they
were
for
him
eddie
would
have
left
them
right
there
but
he
had
said
take
em
home
to
your
mom
and
like
ben
when
someone
said
mom
eddie
jumped
he
scrounged
a
hank
of
rope
from
one
of
the
empty
quonset
warehouses
and
tied
the
crate
onto
the
package
carrier
of
his
bike
his
mother
had
peered
inside
the
crate
even
more
warily
than
eddie
himself
and
then
she
screamed
but
with
delight
rather
than
terror
there
were
four
lobsters
in
the
crate
big
twopounders
with
their
claws
pegged
she
cooked
them
for
supper
and
had
been
extremely
grumpy
with
eddie
when
he
wouldn't
eat
any
what
do
you
think
the
rockefellers
are
eating
this
evening
at
their
place
in
bar
harbor
she
asked
indignantly
what
do
you
think
the
swells
ae
eating
at
twentyone
and
sardi
in
new
york
city
peanut
butter
and
jelly
sandwiches
they're
eating
jobster
eddie
same
as
we
are
now
come
on
give
it
a
try
but
eddie
wouldn't
at
least
that
was
what
his
mother
said
maybe
it
was
true
but
nside
it
felt
more
to
eddie
like
couldn't
than
wouldn't
he
kept
thinking
of
the
way
they
had
slithered
inside
the
crate
and
the
clicking
sounds
their
claws
had
made
she
kept
telling
him
how
delicious
they
were
and
what
a
treat
he
was
missing
until
he
started
to
gasp
for
breath
and
had
to
use
his
aspirator
then
she
left
him
alone
eddie
retreated
to
his
bedroom
and
read
his
mother
called
up
her
friend
eleanor
dunton
eleanor
came
over
and
the
two
of
them
read
old
copies
of
photoplay
and
screen
secrets
and
giggled
over
the
gossip
columns
and
gorged
themselves
on
cold
lobster
salad
when
eddie
got
up
for
school
the
next
morning
his
mother
was
still
in
bed
snoring
away
and
letting
frequent
farts
that
sounded
like
long
mellow
comet
notes
she
was
getting
off
some
good
ones
richie
would
have
said
there
was
nothing
left
in
the
bowl
where
the
lobster
salad
had
been
except
a
few
tiny
blots
of
mayonnaise
that
was
the
last
southern
seacoast
train
eddie
ever
saw
and
when
he
later
saw
mr
braddock
the
derry
trainmaster
he
asked
him
hesitantly
what
had
happened
cump'ny
went
broke
mr
braddock
said
that
all
there
was
to
it
don't
you
read
the
papers
it
hap'nin
ail
over
the
damn
country
now
get
out
of
here
this
ain't
no
place
for
a
kid
after
that
eddie
would
sometimes
walk
along
track
which
had
been
the
southern
seacoast
track
and
listen
as
a
mental
conductor
chanted
names
inside
his
head
reeling
them
off
in
a
lovely
downcast
monotone
those
names
those
magic
names
camden
rockland
bar
harbor
pronounced
baa
haabaa
wiscasset
bath
portland
ogunquit
the
berwicks
he
would
walk
down
track
heading
east
until
he
got
tired
and
the
weeds
growing
up
between
the
crossties
made
him
feel
sad
once
he
had
looked
up
and
seen
seagulls
probably
just
fat
old
dumpgulls
who
didn't
give
a
shit
if
they
ever
saw
the
ocean
but
that
had
not
occurred
to
him
then
wheeling
and
crying
overhead
and
the
sound
of
their
voices
had
made
him
cry
a
little
too
there
had
once
been
a
gate
at
the
qtrance
to
the
trainyards
but
it
had
blown
over
in
a
windstorm
and
no
one
had
bothered
to
replace
it
eddie
came
and
went
pretty
much
as
he
liked
although
mr
braddock
would
kick
him
out
if
he
saw
him
or
any
other
kid
for
that
matter
there
were
truckdrivers
who
would
chase
you
sometimes
put
not
very
far
because
they
thought
you
were
hanging
around
just
so
you
could
hawk
something
and
sometimes
kids
did
mostly
though
the
place
was
quiet
there
was
a
guardbooth
but
it
was
empty
its
glass
windows
broken
by
stones
there
had
been
no
fulltime
security
service
since
or
so
mr
braddock
shooed
the
kids
away
by
day
and
a
nightwatchman
drove
through
four
or
five
times
a
night
in
an
old
studebaker
with
a
searchlight
mounted
outside
the
vent
window
and
that
was
all
there
were
tramps
and
hobos
sometimes
though
if
anything
about
the
trainyards
scared
eddie
they
did
men
with
unshaven
cheeks
and
cracked
skin
and
blisters
on
their
hands
and
coldsores
on
their
lips
they
rode
the
rails
for
avhile
and
then
climbed
down
for
awhile
and
spent
some
time
in
derry
and
then
got
on
another
train
and
went
somewhere
else
sometimes
they
had
missing
fingers
usually
they
were
drunk
and
wanted
to
know
if
you
had
a
cigarette
one
of
these
fellows
had
crawled
out
from
under
the
porch
of
the
house
at
neibolt
street
one
day
and
had
offered
to
give
eddie
a
blowjob
for
a
quarter
eddie
had
backed
away
his
skin
like
ice
his
mouth
as
dry
as
lintballs
one
of
the
hobo
nostrils
had
been
eaten
away
you
could
look
right
into
the
red
scabby
channel
i
don't
have
a
quarter
eddie
said
backing
toward
his
bike
tii
do
it
for
a
dime
the
hobo
croaked
coming
toward
him
he
was
wearing
old
green
flannel
pants
yellow
puke
was
stiffening
across
the
lap
he
unzipped
his
fly
and
reached
inside
he
was
trying
to
grin
his
nose
was
a
red
horror
i
i
don't
have
a
dime
either
eddie
said
and
suddenly
thought
oh
my
god
he
got
leprosy
if
he
touches
me
i'll
catch
it
too
his
control
snapped
and
he
ran
he
heard
the
hobo
break
into
a
shuffling
run
behind
him
his
old
stringtied
shoes
slapping
and
flapping
across
the
riotous
lawn
of
the
empty
saltbox
house
come
back
here
kid
i'll
blow
you
for
free
come
back
here
eddie
had
leaped
on
his
bike
wheezing
now
feeling
his
throat
closing
up
to
a
pinhole
his
chest
had
taken
on
weight
he
hit
the
pedals
and
was
just
picking
up
speed
when
one
of
the
hobo
hands
struck
the
package
carrier
the
bike
shimmied
eddie
looked
over
his
shoulder
and
saw
the
hobo
running
along
behind
the
rear
wheel
/gainingi
his
lips
drawn
back
from
the
black
stumps
of
his
teeth
in
an
expression
which
might
have
been
either
desperation
or
fury
in
spite
of
the
stones
lying
on
his
chest
eddie
had
pedaled
even
faster
expecting
that
one
of
the
hobo
scabcrusted
hands
would
close
over
his
arm
at
any
moment
pulling
him
from
his
raleigh
and
dumping
him
in
the
ditch
where
god
knew
what
would
happen
to
him
he
hadn't
dared
look
around
until
he
had
flashed
past
the
church
school
and
through
the
route
intersection
the
bo
was
gone
eddie
held
this
terrible
story
inside
him
for
almost
a
week
and
then
confided
it
to
richie
tozier
and
bill
denbrough
one
day
when
they
were
reading
comics
over
the
garage
he
didn't
have
leprosy
you
dummy
richie
said
he
had
the
syph
eddie
looked
at
bill
to
see
if
richie
was
ribbing
him
he
had
never
heard
of
a
disease
called
the
sift
before
it
sounded
like
something
richie
might
have
made
up
ts
there
such
a
thing
as
the
sift
bill
bill
nodded
gravely
only
it
the
suhsuhsyph
not
the
sift
it
sshort
for
syphilis
what
that
tt
a
disease
you
get
from
fucking
richie
said
you
know
about
fucking
don't
you
eds
sure
eddie
said
he
hoped
he
wasn't
blushing
he
knew
that
when
you
got
older
stuff
came
out
of
your
penis
when
it
was
hard
vincent
booger
taliendo
had
filled
him
in
on
the
rest
one
day
at
school
what
you
did
when
you
fucked
according
to
boogers
was
you
rubbed
your
cock
against
a
girl
stomach
until
it
got
hard
your
cock
not
the
girl
stomach
then
you
rubbed
some
more
until
you
started
to
get
the
feeling
when
eddie
asked
what
that
meant
boogers
had
only
shaken
his
head
in
a
mysterious
way
boogers
said
that
you
couldn't
describe
it
but
you'd
know
it
as
soon
as
you
got
it
he
said
you
could
practice
by
lying
in
the
bathtub
and
rubbing
your
cock
with
ivory
soap
eddie
had
tried
this
but
the
only
feeling
he
got
was
the
need
to
urinate
after
awhile
anyway
boogers
went
on
after
you
got
the
feeling
this
stuff
came
out
of
your
penis
most
kids
called
it
come
boogers
said
but
his
big
brother
had
told
him
that
the
really
scientific
word
for
it
was
jizzum
and
when
you
got
the
feeling
you
had
to
grab
your
cock
and
aim
it
real
fast
so
you
could
shoot
the
jizzum
into
the
girl
bellybutton
as
soon
as
it
came
out
it
went
down
into
her
stomach
and
made
a
baby
there
do
girls
like
tha
eddie
had
asked
boogers
taliendo
he
himself
was
sort
of
appalled
i
guess
they
must
boogers
had
replied
looking
mystified
himself
now
listen
up
eds
richie
said
because
there
may
be
questions
later
some
women
have
got
this
disease
some
men
too
but
mostly
it
women
a
guy
can
get
it
from
a
woman
or
another
ggguy
if
they're
kwuhkwuhquee
bill
added
right
the
important
thing
is
you
get
the
syph
from
screwing
someone
who
already
got
it
what
does
it
do
eddie
asked
makes
you
rot
richie
said
simply
eddie
stared
at
him
horrified
it
bad
i
know
but
it
true
richie
said
your
nose
is
the
first
thing
to
go
some
guys
with
the
syph
their
noses
fall
right
off
then
their
cocks
pub
puhpuhleez
bill
said
i
just
aaate
hey
man
this
is
science
richie
said
so
what
the
difference
between
leprosy
and
the
syph
eddie
asked
you
dont
get
leprosy
from
fucking
richie
said
promptly
and
then
went
off
into
a
gale
of
laughter
that
left
both
bill
and
eddie
mystified
following
that
day
the
house
at
neibolt
street
had
taken
on
a
kind
of
glow
in
eddie
imagination
looking
at
its
weedy
yard
and
its
slumped
porch
and
the
boards
nailed
across
its
windows
he
would
feel
an
unhealthy
fascination
take
hold
of
him
and
six
weeks
ago
he
had
parked
his
bike
on
the
gravelly
verge
of
the
street
the
sidewalk
ended
four
houses
farther
back
and
walked
across
the
lawn
toward
the
porch
of
that
house
his
heart
had
been
beating
hard
in
his
chest
and
his
mouth
had
that
dry
taste
again
listening
to
bill
story
of
the
dreadful
picture
he
knew
that
what
he
had
felt
when
approaching
that
house
was
about
the
same
as
what
bill
had
felt
going
into
george
room
he
did
not
feel
as
if
he
was
in
control
of
himself
he
felt
pushed
it
did
not
seem
as
if
his
feet
were
moving
instead
the
house
itself
brooding
and
silent
seemed
to
draw
closer
to
where
he
stood
faintly
he
could
hear
a
diesel
engine
in
the
trainyard
that
and
the
liquidmetallic
slam
of
couplings
being
made
they
were
shunting
some
cars
onto
sidings
picking
up
others
making
a
train
his
hand
gripped
his
aspirator
but
oddly
his
asthma
had
not
closed
down
as
it
had
on
the
day
he
fled
from
the
hobo
with
the
rotted
nose
there
was
only
that
sense
of
standing
still
and
watching
the
house
slide
stealthily
toward
him
as
if
on
a
hidden
track
eddie
looked
under
the
porch
there
was
no
one
there
it
was
not
really
surprising
this
was
spring
and
hobos
showed
up
most
frequently
in
derry
from
late
september
to
early
november
during
those
six
weeks
or
so
a
man
could
pick
up
daywork
on
one
of
the
outlying
farms
if
he
looked
even
halfdecent
there
were
potatoes
and
apples
to
pick
snowfence
to
string
barn
and
shed
roofs
which
needed
to
be
patched
before
december
came
along
whistling
up
winter
no
hobos
under
the
porch
but
plenty
of
sign
they
had
been
there
empty
beer
cans
empty
beer
bottles
empty
liquor
bottles
a
dirtcrusted
blanket
lay
against
the
brick
foundation
like
a
dead
dog
there
were
difts
of
crumpled
newspapers
and
one
old
shoe
and
a
smell
like
garbage
there
were
thick
layers
of
old
leaves
under
there
not
wanting
to
do
it
but
unable
to
help
himself
eddie
had
crawled
under
the
porch
he
could
feel
his
heartbeat
slamming
in
his
head
now
driving
white
spots
of
light
across
his
field
of
vision
the
smell
was
worse
underneath
booze
and
sweat
and
the
dark
brown
perfume
of
decaying
leaves
the
old
leaves
didn't
even
crackle
under
his
hands
and
knees
they
and
the
old
newspapers
only
sighed
i'm
a
hobo
eddie
thought
incoherently
i'm
a
hobo
and
i
ride
the
rods
that
what
i
do
ain't
got
no
money
ain't
got
no
home
but
i
got
me
a
bottle
and
a
dollar
and
a
place
to
sleep
i'll
pick
apples
this
week
and
potatoes
the
week
after
that
and
when
the
frost
locks
up
the
ground
like
money
inside
a
bank
vault
why
i'll
hop
a
gs&ampwm
box
that
smells
of
sugarbeets
and
i'll
sit
in
the
corner
and
pull
some
hay
over
me
if
there
is
some
and
i'll
drink
me
a
little
drink
and
chew
me
a
link
chew
and
sooner
or
later
i'll
get
to
portland
or
beantown
and
if
i
don't
get
busted
by
a
railroad
security
dick
i'll
hop
one
of
those
bama
star
boxes
and
head
down
south
and
when
i
get
there
i'll
pick
lemons
or
limes
or
oranges
and
if
i
get
nagged
i'll
build
roads
for
tourists
to
ride
on
hell
i
done
it
before
ain't
i
i'm
just
a
lonesome
old
hobo
ain't
got
no
money
ain't
got
no
home
but
i
got
me
one
thing
i
got
me
a
disease
that
eating
me
up
my
skin
cracking
open
my
teeth
are
falling
out
and
you
know
what
i
can
feel
myself
turning
bad
like
an
apple
that
going
soft
i
can
feel
it
happening
eating
from
the
inside
to
the
out
eating
eating
eating
me
eddie
pulled
the
stiffening
blanket
aside
tweezing
at
it
with
his
thumb
and
forefinger
grimacing
at
its
matted
feel
one
of
those
low
cellar
windows
was
directly
behind
it
one
pane
broken
the
other
opaque
with
dirt
he
leaned
forward
now
feeling
almost
hypnotized
he
leaned
closer
to
the
window
closer
to
the
cellardarkness
breathing
n
that
smell
of
age
and
must
and
dryrot
closer
and
closer
to
the
black
and
surely
the
leper
would
have
caught
him
if
his
asthma
hadn't
picked
that
exact
moment
to
kick
up
it
cramped
his
lungs
with
a
weight
that
was
painless
yet
frightening
his
breath
at
once
took
on
the
familiar
hateful
whistling
sound
he
drew
back
and
that
was
when
the
face
appeared
its
coming
was
so
sudden
so
startling
and
yet
at
the
same
time
so
expected
that
eddie
could
not
have
screamed
even
if
he
hadn't
been
having
an
asthma
attack
his
eyes
bulged
his
mouth
creaked
open
it
was
not
the
hobo
with
the
flayed
nose
but
there
were
resemblances
terrible
resemblances
and
yet
this
thing
could
not
be
human
nothing
could
be
so
eaten
up
and
remain
alive
the
skin
of
its
forehead
was
split
open
white
bone
coated
with
a
membrane
of
yellow
mucusy
stuff
peered
through
like
the
lens
of
a
bleary
searchlight
the
nose
was
a
bridge
of
raw
gristle
above
two
red
flaring
channels
one
eye
was
a
gleeful
blue
the
other
socket
was
filled
with
a
mass
of
spongy
brownblack
tissue
the
lepers
lower
lip
sagged
like
liver
it
had
no
upper
lip
at
all
its
teeth
poked
out
in
a
sneering
ring
it
shot
one
hand
out
through
the
broken
pane
it
shot
the
other
through
the
dirty
glass
to
the
left
shattering
it
to
fragments
its
questing
clutching
hands
crawled
with
sores
beetles
crawled
and
lumbered
busily
to
and
fro
mewling
gasping
eddie
hunched
his
way
backward
he
could
hardly
breathe
his
heart
was
a
runaway
engine
in
his
chest
the
leper
appeared
to
be
wearing
the
ragged
remains
of
some
strange
silvery
suit
things
were
crawling
in
the
straggles
of
its
brown
hair
how
bout
a
blowjob
eddie
the
apparition
croaked
grinning
with
its
remains
of
a
mouth
it
lilted
bobby
does
it
for
a
dime
he
will
do
it
anytime
fifteen
cents
for
overtime
it
winked
that
me
eddie
bob
gray
and
now
that
we've
been
properly
introduced
one
of
its
hands
splatted
against
eddie
right
shoulder
eddie
screamed
thinly
thats
all
right
the
leper
said
and
eddie
saw
with
dreamlike
terror
that
it
was
crawling
out
of
the
window
the
bony
shield
behind
its
peeling
forehead
snapped
the
thin
wooden
strip
between
the
two
panes
its
hands
clawed
through
the
leafy
mulchy
earth
the
silver
shoulders
of
its
suit
costume
whatever
it
was
began
to
push
through
the
gap
that
one
glaring
blue
eye
never
left
eddie
face
here
i
come
eddie
that
all
right
it
croaked
you'll
like
it
down
here
with
us
some
of
your
friends
are
down
here
its
hand
reached
out
again
and
in
some
corner
of
his
panicmaddened
screaming
mind
eddie
was
suddenly
coldly
sure
that
if
that
thing
touched
his
bare
skin
he
would
begin
to
rot
too
the
thought
broke
his
paralysis
he
skittered
backward
on
his
hands
and
knees
then
turned
and
lunged
for
the
far
end
of
the
porch
sunlight
falling
in
narrow
dusty
beams
through
the
cracks
between
the
porch
boards
striped
his
face
from
moment
to
moment
his
head
pushed
through
the
dusty
cobwebs
that
settled
in
his
hair
he
looked
back
over
his
shoulder
and
saw
that
the
leper
was
halfway
out
tt
won't
do
you
any
good
to
run
eddie
it
called
eddie
had
reached
the
far
end
of
the
porch
there
was
a
latticework
skirt
here
the
sun
shone
through
it
printing
diamonds
of
light
on
his
cheeks
and
forehead
he
lowered
his
head
and
slammed
into
it
with
no
hesitation
at
all
tearing
the
entire
skirt
free
with
a
scream
of
rusted
ha'penny
nails
there
was
a
tangle
of
rosebushes
beyond
and
eddie
tore
through
these
stumbling
to
his
feet
as
he
did
so
not
feeling
the
thorns
that
scrawled
shallow
cuts
along
his
arms
and
cheeks
and
neck
he
turned
and
backed
away
on
buckling
legs
pulling
his
aspirator
out
of
his
pocket
triggering
it
surely
it
hadn't
really
happened
he
had
been
thinking
about
that
hobo
and
his
mind
had
well
had
just
put
on
a
show
shown
him
a
movie
a
horror
movie
like
one
of
those
saturdaymatinee
pictures
with
frankenstein
and
wolfman
that
they
had
sometimes
at
the
bijou
or
the
gem
or
the
aladdin
sure
that
was
all
he
had
scared
himself
what
an
asshole
there
was
even
time
to
utter
a
shaky
laugh
at
the
unsuspected
vividness
of
his
imagination
before
the
rotting
hands
shot
out
from
under
the
porch
chwing
at
the
rosebushes
with
mindless
ferocity
pulling
at
them
stripping
them
printing
beads
of
blood
on
them
eddie
shrieked
the
leper
was
crawling
out
it
was
wearing
a
clown
suit
he
saw
a
clown
suit
with
big
orange
buttons
down
the
front
it
saw
eddie
and
grinned
its
halfmouth
dropped
open
and
its
tongue
lolled
out
eddie
shrieked
again
but
no
one
could
have
heard
one
boy
breathless
shriek
under
the
pounding
of
the
diesel
engine
in
the
trainyard
the
leper
tongue
had
not
just
dropped
from
its
mouth
it
was
at
least
three
feet
long
and
had
unrolled
like
a
party
favor
it
came
to
an
arrowpoint
which
dragged
in
the
dirt
foam
thicksticky
and
yellowish
coursed
along
it
bugs
crawled
over
it
the
rosebushes
which
had
been
showing
the
first
touches
of
spring
green
when
eddie
broke
through
them
now
turned
a
dead
and
lacy
black
blowjob
the
leper
whispered
and
tottered
to
its
feet
eddie
raced
for
his
bike
it
was
the
same
race
as
before
only
it
now
had
the
quality
of
a
nightmare
where
you
can
only
move
with
the
most
agonizing
slowness
no
matter
how
hard
you
try
to
go
fast
and
in
those
dreams
didn't
you
always
hear
or
feel
something
some
it
gaining
on
you
didn't
you
always
smell
its
stinking
breath
as
eddie
was
smelling
it
now
for
a
moment
he
felt
a
wild
hope
perhaps
this
really
was
a
nightmare
perhaps
he
would
awake
in
his
own
bed
bathed
in
sweat
shaking
maybe
even
crying
but
alive
safe
then
he
pushed
the
thought
away
its
charm
was
deadly
ts
comfort
fatal
he
did
not
try
to
mount
his
bike
immediately
he
ran
with
it
instead
head
down
pushing
the
handlebars
he
felt
as
if
he
was
drowning
not
in
water
but
inside
his
own
chest
blowjo
the
leper
whispered
again
come
back
anytime
eddie
bring
your
friends
its
rotting
fingers
seemed
to
touch
the
back
of
his
neck
but
perhaps
that
was
only
a
dangling
strand
of
cobweb
from
under
the
porch
caught
in
his
hair
and
brushing
against
his
shrinking
flesh
eddie
leaped
onto
his
bike
and
pedaled
away
not
caring
that
his
throat
had
closed
up
tight
as
tillie
again
not
giving
two
sucks
for
his
asthma
not
looking
back
he
didn't
look
back
until
he
was
almost
home
and
of
course
there
was
nothing
behind
him
when
he
finally
did
but
two
kids
headed
over
to
the
park
to
play
ball
that
night
lying
straight
as
a
poker
in
bed
one
hand
folded
tightly
around
his
aspirator
looking
into
the
shadows
he
heard
the
leper
whisper
it
won't
do
you
any
good
to
run
eddie
wow

eddie
said
in
a
low
voice
bill
looked
at
him
sharply
wh
wh
what
real
i
said
eddie
looked
at
him
almost
resentfully
it
really
happened
it
was
real
and
before
he
could
stop
himself
before
he
even
knew
he
was
going
to
do
it
eddie
found
himself
telling
the
story
of
the
leper
that
had
come
crawling
out
of
the
basement
at
neibolt
street
halfway
through
the
telling
he
began
to
gasp
and
had
to
use
his
aspirator
and
at
the
end
he
burst
into
shrill
tears
his
thin
body
shaking
they
all
looked
at
him
uncomfortably
and
then
stan
put
a
hand
on
his
back
bill
gave
him
an
awkward
hug
while
the
others
glanced
away
embarrassed
that
aall
right
e
eddie
it
oookay
i
saw
it
too
ben
hanscom
said
suddenly
his
voice
was
flat
and
harsh
and
scared
eddie
looked
up
his
face
still
naked
with
tears
his
eyes
red
and
rawlooking
wha
i
saw
the
clown
ben
said
only
he
wasn't
like
you
said
at
least
not
when
i
saw
him
he
wasn't
all
gooshy
he
was
he
was
dry
he
paused
ducked
his
head
and
looked
at
his
hands
which
lay
palely
on
his
elephantine
thighs
i
think
he
was
the
mummy
like
in
the
movies
eddie
asked
like
that
but
not
like
tha
ben
said
slowly
in
the
movies
he
looks
fake
it
scary
but
you
can
tell
it
a
putup
job
you
know
all
those
bandages
they
look
too
neat
or
something
but
this
guy
he
looked
the
way
a
real
mummy
would
look
i
think
if
you
actually
found
one
in
a
room
under
a
pyramid
i
mean
except
for
the
suit
wuhwuhwuhhut
suhhoot
ben
looked
at
eddie
a
silver
suit
with
big
orange
buttons
down
the
front
eddie
mouth
dropped
open
he
shut
it
and
said
if
you're
kidding
say
so
i
still
i
still
dream
about
that
guy
under
the
porch
not
a
joke
ben
said
and
began
to
tell
the
story
he
told
it
slowly
beginning
with
his
volunteering
to
help
mrs
douglas
count
and
store
books
and
ending
with
his
own
bad
dreams
he
spoke
slowly
not
looking
at
the
others
he
spoke
as
if
deeply
ashamed
of
his
own
behavior
he
didn't
raise
his
head
again
until
the
story
was
over
you
must
have
dreamed
it
richie
said
finally
he
saw
ben
wince
and
hurried
on
now
don't
take
it
personal
big
ben
but
you
got
to
see
that
balloons
can't
like
float
against
the
wind
pictures
can't
wink
either
ben
said
richie
looked
from
ben
to
bill
troubled
accusing
ben
of
dreaming
awake
was
one
thing
accusing
bill
was
something
else
bill
was
their
leader
the
guy
they
all
looked
up
to
no
one
said
so
out
loud
no
one
needed
to
but
bill
was
the
idea
man
the
guy
who
could
think
of
something
to
do
on
a
boring
day
the
guy
who
remembered
games
the
others
had
forgotten
and
in
some
odd
way
they
all
sensed
something
comfortingly
adult
about
bill
perhaps
it
was
a
sense
of
accountability
a
feeling
that
bill
would
take
the
responsibility
if
responsibility
needed
to
be
taken
the
truth
was
richie
believed
bill
story
crazy
as
it
was
and
perhaps
he
didn't
want
to
believe
ben
or
eddie
for
that
matter
nothing
like
that
ever
happened
to
you
hu
eddie
asked
richie
richie
paused
began
to
say
something
shook
his
head
paused
again
then
said

said
quickly
and
looked
somewhere

his
small
face
was
pale
his
lips
pressed
together
so
tightly
they
were
white

got
to

and
walked
to
the
embankment

in
his
pockets
he
stood
watching
the
water
course
over
the
top
of
the
original
dam
and
pile
up
behind
the
second
watergate
come
on
now
stanley
richie
said
in
a
shrill
falsetto
this
was
another
of
his
voices
granny
grunt
when
speaking
in
his
granny
grunt
voice
richie
would
hobble
around
with
one
fist
against
the
small
of
his
back
and
cackle
a
lot
he
still
however
sounded
more
like
richie

than
anyone

on
richie

astonished

shut

said
and
sat
down
he
looked
at
stan
uris
mistrustfully
bright
spots
of
color
flamed
in
stan
cheeks
but
he
still
looked
more
scared
than
mad
that
oka
eddie
said
quietly

stanley
said
his
eyes
flicked
from
one
of
them
to
the
next
to
the
next
to
the
next
he
seemed
to
struggle
with
himself
yyyou

also
speaking
quietly
w

dddid
it
wasn't
a
clown
it
was
which
was
when
the
carrying

of

all
jump
as

richard
tozier
turns
off
the
radio
which
has
been
blaring
out
madonna
like
a
virgi
on
wzon
a
sation
which
declares
itself
to
be
banger
am
stereo
rocker
with
a
kind
of
hysterical
frequency
pulls
over
to
the
side
of
the
road
shuts
down
the
engine
of
the
mustang
the
avis
people
rented
him
at
bangor
international
and
gets
out
he
hears
the
pull
and
release
of
his
own
breath
in
his
ears
he
has
seen
a
sign
which
has
caused
the
flesh
of
his
back
to
break
out
in
hard
ridges
of
gooseflesh
he
walks
to
the
front
of
the
car
and
puts
one
hand
on
its
hood
he
hears
the
engine
ticking
softly
to
itself
as
it
cools
he
hears
a
jay
scream
briefly
and
then
shut
up
there
are
crickets
and
as
far
as
the
soundtrack
goes
that
it
he
has
seen
the
sign
he
passes
it
and
suddenly
he
is
in
derry
again
after
twentyfive
years
richie
trashmout
tozier
has
come
home
he
has
burning
agony
suddenly
needles
into
his
eyes
breaking
his
thought
cleanly
off
he
utters
a
strangled
little
shout
and
his
hands
fly
up
to
his
face
the
only
time
he
felt
anything
even
remotely
like
this
burning
pain
was
when
he
got
an
eyelash
caught
under
one
of
his
contacts
in
college
and
that
was
only
in
one
eye
this
terrible
pain
is
in
both
before
he
can
reach
even
halfway
to
his
face
the
pain
is
gone
he
lowers
his
hands
again
slowly
thoughtfully
and
looks
down
route
he
left
the
turnpike
at
the
etnahaven
exit
wanting
for
some
reason
he
doesn't
understand
not
to
come
in
by
the
turnpike
which
was
still
under
construction
in
the
derry
area
when
he
and
his
folks
shook
the
dust
of
this
weird
little
town
from
their
heels
and
headed
out
for
the
midwest
no
the
turnpike
would
have
been
quicker
but
it
would
have
been
wrong
so
he
had
driven
along
route
through
the
sleeping
nestle
of
buildings
that
was
haven
village
then
turned
off
on
route
and
as
he
went
the
day
grew
steadily
brighter
now
this
sign
it
was
the
same
sort
of
sign
which
marked
the
borders
of
more
than
six
hundred
maine
towns
but
how
this
one
had
squeezed
his
heart
penobscot
county
maine
beyond
that
an
elks
sign
a
rotary
club
sign
and
completing
the
trinity
a
sign
proclaiming
the
fact
that
derr
y
lions
roar
for
the
united
fund
past
that
one
there
is
just
route
again
continuing
on
in
a
straight
line
between
bulking
banks
of
pine
and
spruce
in
this
silent
light
as
the
day
steadies
itself
those
trees
look
as
dreamy
as
bluegray
cigarette
smoke
stacked
on
the
moveless
air
of
a
sealed
room
derry
he
thinks
derry
god
help
me
derry
stone
the
crows
here
he
is
on
route
five
miles
up
if
time
or
tornado
has
not
carried
it
away
in
the
intervening
years
will
be
the
rhulin
farms
where
his
mother
bought
all
of
their
eggs
and
most
of
their
vegetables
two
miles
beyond
that
route
became
witcham
road
and
of
course
witcham
road
eventually
became
witcham
street
can
you
gimme
hallelujah
world
without
end
amen
and
somewhere
along
there
between
the
rhulin
farms
and
town
he
would
drive
past
the
bowers
place
and
then
the
hanlon
place
a
mile
or
so
after
hanlon
he
would
see
the
first
glitter
of
the
kenduskeag
and
the
first
spreading
tangle
of
poison
green
the
lush
lowlands
that
had
been
known
for
some
reason
as
the
barrens
i
really
don't
know
if
i
can
face
all
of
that
richie
thinks
i
mean
let
tell
the
truth
here
folks
i
just
don't
know
if
i
can
the
whole
previous
night
has
passed
in
a
dream
for
him
as
long
as
he
continued
travelling
moving
forward
making
miles
the
dream
went
on
but
now
he
has
stopped
or
rather
the
sign
has
stopped
him
and
he
has
awakened
to
a
strange
truth
the
dream
was
the
reality
derry
is
the
reality
it
seems
he
just
cannot
stop
remembering
he
thinks
the
memories
will
eventually
drive
him
mad
and
now
he
bites
down
on
his
lip
and
puts
his
hands
together
palm
to
palm
tight
as
if
to
keep
himself
from
flying
apart
he
feels
that
he
will
fly
apart
and
soon
there
seems
to
be
some
mad
part
of
him
which
actually
looks
forward
to
what
may
be
coming
but
most
of
him
only
wonders
how
he
going
to
get
through
the
next
few
days
he
and
now
his
thoughts
break
off
again
a
deer
is
walking
out
into
the
road
he
can
hear
the
light
thud
of
its
springsoft
hoofs
on
the
tar
richie
breath
stops
in
midexhale
then
slowly
starts
again
he
looks
dumbfounded
part
of
him
thinking
that
he
never
saw
anything
like
this
on
rodeo
drive
no
he'd
needed
to
come
back
home
to
see
something
like
this
it
a
doe
'doe
a
deer
a
female
dee
a
voice
chants
merrily
in
his
head
she
out
of
the
woods
on
the
right
and
pauses
in
the
middle
of
route
front
legs
on
one
side
of
the
broken
white
line
rear
legs
on
the
other
her
dark
eyes
regard
rich
tozier
mildly
he
reads
interest
in
those
eyes
but
no
fear
he
looks
at
her
in
wonder
thinking
she
an
omen
or
a
portent
or
some
sort
of
madame
azonka
shit
like
that
and
then
quite
unexpectedly
a
memory
of
mr
nell
comes
to
him
what
a
start
he
had
given
them
that
day
busting
in
on
them
in
the
wake
of
bill
story
and
ben
story
and
eddie
story
the
whole
bunch
of
them
had
damn
near
gone
up
to
heaven
now
looking
at
the
deer
rich
draws
in
a
deep
breath
and
finds
himself
speaking
in
one
of
his
voices
but
for
the
first
time
in
twentyfive
years
or
more
it
is
the
voice
of
the
irish
cop
one
he
had
incorporated
into
his
repertoire
after
that
memorable
day
it
comes
rolling
out
of
the
morning
silence
like
a
great
big
bowling
ball
it
is
louder
and
bigger
than
richie
would
ever
have
believed
jaysus
christ
on
a
jumpedup
chariotdriven
crutch
what
a
nice
girrul
like
you
doin
out
in
this
wilderness
deer
jaysus
christ
you
be
gettin
on
home
before
i
decide
to
tell
father
o'staggers
on
y
before
the
echoes
have
died
away
before
the
first
shocked
jay
can
begin
scolding
him
for
his
sacrilege
the
doe
flicks
her
tail
at
him
like
a
truce
flag
and
disappears
into
the
smoky
looking
firs
on
the
left
side
of
the
road
leaving
only
a
small
pile
of
steaming
pellets
behind
to
show
that
even
at
thirtyseven
richie
tozier
is
still
capable
of
getting
off
a
good
one
from
time
to
time
richie
begins
to
laugh
he
is
only
chuckling
at
first
and
then
his
own
ludicrousness
strikes
him
standing
here
in
the
dawnlight
of
a
maine
morning
thirtyfour
hundred
miles
from
home
shouting
at
a
deer
in
the
accents
of
an
irish
cop
the
chuckles
become
a
string
of
giggles
the
giggles
become
guffaws
the
guffaws
become
howls
and
he
is
finally
reduced
to
holding
on
to
his
car
while
tears
roll
down
his
face
and
he
wonders
dimly
if
he
going
to
wet
his
pants
or
what
every
time
he
starts
to
get
control
of
himself
his
eyes
fix
on
that
little
clump
of
pellets
and
he
goes
off
into
fresh
gales
snorting
and
snickering
he
is
at
last
able
to
get
back
into
the
driver
seat
and
restart
the
mustang
engine
an
orinco
chemicalfertilizer
truck
snores
by
in
a
blast
of
wind
after
it
passes
him
rich
pulls
out
and
heads
for
derry
again
he
feels
better
now
in
control
or
maybe
it
just
that
he
moving
again
making
miles
and
the
dream
has
reasserted
itself
he
starts
thinking
about
mr
nell
again
mr
nell
and
that
day
by
the
dam
mr
nell
had
asked
them
who
thought
this
little
trick
up
he
can
see
the
five
of
them
looking
uneasily
at
each
other
and
remembers
how
ben
finally
stepped
forward
cheeks
pale
and
eyes
downcast
face
trembling
all
over
as
he
fought
grimly
to
keep
from
blubbering
poor
kid
probably
thought
he
was
going
to
get
fivetoten
in
shawshank
for
backflooding
the
drains
on
witcham
street
rich
thinks
now
but
he
had
owned
up
to
it
just
the
same
and
by
doing
that
he
had
forced
the
rest
of
them
to
come
forward
and
back
him
up
it
was
either
that
or
consider
themselves
bad
guys
cowards
all
the
things
their
tv
heroes
were
not
and
that
had
welded
them
together
for
better
or
worse
had
apparently
welded
them
together
for
the
last
twentyseven
years
sometimes
events
are
dominoes
the
first
knocks
over
the
second
the
second
knocks
over
the
third
and
there
you
are
when
richie
wonders
did
it
become
too
late
to
turn
back
when
he
and
stan
showed
up
and
pitched
in
helping
to
build
the
dam
when
bill
told
them
how
the
school
picture
of
his
brother
had
turned
its
head
and
winked
maybe
but
to
rich
tozier
it
seems
that
the
dominoes
really
began
to
fall
when
ben
hanscom
stepped
forward
and
sai
i
showed
them
how
to
do
it
it
my
fault
mr
nell
simply
stood
there
looking
at
him
lips
pressed
together
hands
on
his
creaking
black
leather
belt
he
looked
from
ben
to
the
spreading
pool
behind
the
dam
and
then
back
to
ben
again
his
face
that
of
a
man
who
can't
believe
what
he
is
seeing
he
was
a
burly
irishman
his
hair
a
premature
white
combed
back
in
neat
waves
beneath
his
peaked
blue
cap
his
eyes
were
bright
blue
his
nose
bright
red
there
were
small
nests
of
burst
capillaries
in
his
cheeks
he
was
a
man
of
no
more
than
medium
height
but
to
the
five
boys
arrayed
before
him
he
looked
at
least
eight
feet
tall
mr
nell
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
but
before
he
could
bill
denbrough
had
stepped
up
beside
ben
thih
thit
wwuhwuh
was
mmy
#tiiidea
he
finally
managed
to
say
he
heaved
in
a
gigantic
gulping
breath
and
as
mr
nell
stood
there
regarding
him
impassively
the
sun
tossing
back
imperial
flashes
from
his
badge
bill
managed
to
stutter
out
the
rest
of
what
he
needed
to
say
it
wasn't
ben
fault
ben
just
happened
to
come
along
and
show
them
how
to
do
better
what
they
were
already
doing
badly
me
to
eddie
said
abruptly
and
stepped
up
on
ben
other
side
what
this
me
to
mr
nell
asked
is
that
yer
name
or
yer
address
buckaroo
eddie
flushed
tightly
the
color
went
all
the
way
up
to
the
roots
of
bis
hair
i
was
with
bill
before
ben
even
cam
he
said
that
was
all
i
meant
richie
stepped
up
next
to
eddie
the
idea
that
a
voice
or
two
might
cheer
mr
nell
up
a
little
get
him
thinking
jolly
thoughts
popped
into
his
head
on
second
thought
and
second
thoughts
were
for
richie
extremely
rare
and
wonderful
things
maybe
a
voice
or
two
might
only
make
things
worse
mr
nell
didn't
look
like
he
was
in
what
richie
sometimes
thought
of
as
a
chuckalicious
mood
in
fact
mr
nell
looked
like
maybe
chucks
were
the
last
thing
on
his
mind
so
he
just
said
i
was
in
on
it
to
in
a
low
voice
and
then
made
his
mouth
shut
up
and
me
stan
said
stepping
next
to
bill
now
the
five
of
them
were
standing
before
mr
nell
in
a
line
ben
looked
from
one
side
to
the
other
more
than
dazed
he
was
almost
stupefied
by
their
support
for
a
moment
richie
thought
ole
haystack
was
going
to
burst
into
tears
of
gratitude
jaysu
mr
nell
said
again
and
although
he
sounded
deeply
disgusted
his
face
suddenly
looked
as
if
it
might
like
to
laugh
a
sorrier
bunch
of
boyos
i
ain't
nivver
seen
if
yer
folks
knew
where
you
were
i
guess
there'd
be
some
hot
bottoms
tonight
i
ain't
sure
there
won't
be
anyway
richie
could
hold
back
no
longer
his
mouth
simply
fell
open
and
then
ran
away
like
the
gingerbread
man
as
it
so
often
did
how
things
back
in
the
auid
country
mr
nell
it
bugled
ah
yer
a
sight
for
sore
eyes
sure
an
begorrah
yer
a
lovely
man
a
credit
to
the
auld
sod
til
be
a
credit
to
the
seat
of
yer
pants
in
about
three
seconds
my
dear
little
friend
mr
nell
said
dryly
bill
turned
on
him
snarled
for
gggod
ssake
rrrichie
shuh
shuhhut
up
good
advice
master
william
denbrough
mr
nell
said
tii
bet
zack
doesn't
know
you're
down
here
in
the
bar'ns
playing
amongst
the
floating
turdies
does
bill
dropped
his
eyes
shook
his
head
wild
roses
burned
in
his
cheeks
mr
nell
looked
at
ben
i
don't
recall
your
name
son
ben
hanscom
sir
ben
whispered
mr
nell
nodded
and
looked
back
at
the
dam
again
this
was
your
idea
how
to
build
it
yeah
ben
whisper
was
now
nearly
inaudible
well
yer
a
hell
of
an
engineer
big
boy
but
you
don't
know
jack
shit
about
these
here
bar'ns
or
the
derry
drainage
system
do
you
ben
shook
his
head
not
unkindly
mr
nell
told
him
there
two
parts
to
the
system
one
part
carries
solid
human
waste
shit
if
i'd
not
be
offendin
yer
tender
ears
the
other
part
carries
gray
water
water
flushed
from
toilets
or
run
down
the
drains
from
sinks
and
washinmachines
and
showers
it
also
the
water
that
runs
down
the
gutters
into
the
city
drains
well
ye've
caused
no
problems
with
the
solid
waste
removal
thank
god
all
of
that
gets
pumped
into
the
kenduskeag
a
bit
farther
down
there
probably
some
almighty
big
patties
down
that
way
half
a
mile
dryin
in
the
sun
thanks
to
what
you
done
but
you
can
be
pretty
sure
that
there
ain't
shit
stickin
to
anyone
ceiling
because
of
it
but
as
for
the
gray
water
well
there
no
pumps
for
gray
water
that
all
runs
downhill
in
what
the
engineer
boyos
call
gravity
drains
and
i'll
bet
you
know
where
all
them
gravity
drains
end
up
don't
you
big
boy
up
there
ben
said
he
pointed
to
the
area
behind
the
dam
the
area
they
had
in
large
part
submerged
he
did
this
without
looking
up
big
tears
were
beginning
to
course
slowly
down
his
cheeks
mr
nell
pretended
not
to
notice
that
right
my
large
young
friend
all
them
gravity
drains
feed
into
streams
that
feed
into
the
upper
barrens
in
fact
a
good
many
of
them
little
streams
that
come
tricklin
down
are
gray
water
and
gray
water
only
comin
out
of
drams
you
can't
even
see
they're
so
deep
buried
in
the
underbrush
the
shit
goes
one
way
and
everythin
else
goes
the
other
god
praise
the
clever
mind
o
man
and
did
it
ever
cross
yer
minds
that
you'd
spent
the
whole
livelong
day
paddlin
around
in
derry
pee
an
old
wash
water
'
eddie
suddenly
began
to
gasp
and
had
to
use
his
aspirator
what
you
did
was
back
water
up
into
about
six
o
the
eight
central
catchbasins
that
serve
witcham
and
jackson
and
kansas
and
four
or
five
little
streets
that
run
between
em
mr
nell
fixed
bill
denbrough
with
a
dry
glance
one
of
em
serves
yer
own
hearth
an
home
young
master
denbrough
so
there
we
are
with
sinks
that
won't
drain
washinmachines
that
won't
drain
outflow
pipes
pourin
merrily
into
cellars
ben
let
out
a
dry
barking
sob
the
others
turned
toward
him
and
then
looked
away
mr
nell
put
a
large
hand
on
the
boy
shoulder
it
was
callused
and
hard
but
at
the
moment
it
was
also
gentle
now
now
no
need
to
take
on
big
boy
maybe
it
ain't
that
bad
at
least
not
yet
could
be
i
exaggerated
just
a
mite
to
make
sure
you
took
my
point
they
sent
me
down
to
see
if
a
tree
blew
down
across
the
stream
that
happens
from
time
to
time
there
no
need
for
anyone
but
me
and
you
five
to
know
it
wasn't
just
that
we've
got
more
important
things
to
worry
about
in
town
these
days
than
a
little
backedup
water
i'll
say
on
my
report
that
i
located
the
blowdown
and
some
boys
came
along
and
helped
me
shift
it
out
o
the
way
o
the
water

that
i'll
mention
ye
by
name

not
be
gettin
any
citations

surveyed
the

of

furiously
wiping
his
eyes
with
his
handkerchief

looking
thoughtfully
at
the
dam

one
hand

close
by

with
one
hand
on

hard
if

said
his
voice
was
thin
and
whistling
but
it
was
also
unmistakably
firm
and
he
right

richie
shrugged

he
right
and
bill
right
too

richie
thought
mr
nell
would
become
angry
again
at
that
but
the
whitehaired
cop
surprised
him
surprised
them
all
with
a
smile
ayu

said

i'll
not

but
hark
to
what
i'm

he
leveled
a
finger
at
them
and
they
all
looked
at

soberly
if

down
here
to
play
ye
come
in
a
gang
like
ye
are
now
together

they

all
the
same
i

down
here
mostly
because
ye'd
be
down
here
anyway
but
for
yer
own
good
here
or
anywhere
around
gang
together
he
looked
at
bill
do

disagree
with
me
young
master
bill
denbrough
nnno
sir
bill
said
w
we'll
stay
tuhtuhtuh
that

for

mr
nell
said
yer
hand
on
it
bill
stuck
out
his
hand
and
mr
nell
shook
it
richie
shook
off
stan
and
stepped
forward
sure
an
begorrah
mr
nell
yer
a
prince
among
men
y'are
a
foine
man
a
foine
foine
ma
he
stuck
out
his
own
hand
seized
the
irishman
huge
paw
and
flagged
it
furiously
grinning
all
the
time
to
the
bemused
mr
nell
the
boy
looked
like
a
hideous
parody
of
franklin
d
roosevelt
thank
you
boy
mr
nell
said
retrieving
his
hand
ye
want
to
work
on
that
a
bit
as
of
now
ye
sound
about
as
irish
as
groucho
marx
the
other
boys
laughed
mostly
in
relief
even
as
he
was
laughing
stan
shot
richie
a
reproachful
look
grow
up
richie
mr
nell
shook
hands
all
around
gripping
ben
last
of
all
ye've
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
but
bad
judgment
big
boy
as
for
that
there
did
you
see
how
to
do
it
in
a
book
ben
shook
his
head
just
figured
it
out
yes
sir
well
if
that
don't
beat
harry
ye'll
do
great
things
someday
i've
no
doubt
but
the
barrens
isn't
the
place
to
do
em
he
looked
around
thoughtfully
no
great
thing
will
ever
be
done
here
nasty
place
he
sighed
tear
it
down
dear
boys
tear
it
right
down
i
believe
i'll
just
sit
me
down
in
the
shade
o
this
bush
here
and
bide
a
wee
as
you
œ
it
he
looked
ironically
at
richie
as
he
said
this
last
as
if
inviting
another
manic
outburst
yes
sir
richie
said
humbly
and
that
was
all
mr
nell
nodded
satisfied
and
the
boys
fell
to
work
once
again
turning
to
ben
this
time
to
show
them
the
quickest
way
to
tear
down
what
he
had
shown
them
how
to
build
meanwhile
mr
nell
removed
a
brown
bottle
from
inside
his
tunic
and
helped
himself
to
a
large
gulp
he
coughed
then
blew
out
breath
in
an
explosive
sigh
and
regarded
the
boys
with
watery
benign
eyes
and
what
might
ye
have
in
yer
bottle
sor
richie
asked
from
the
place
where
he
was
standing
kneedeep
in
the
water
richie
can't
you
ever
shut
up
eddie
hissed
this
mr
nell
regarded
richie
with
mild
surprise
and
looked
at
the
bottle
again
it
had
no
label
of
any
kind
on
it
this
is
the
cough
medicine
of
the
gods
my
boy
now
let
see
if
you
can
bend
yer
back
anywhere
near
as
fast
as
you
can
wag
yer
tongue
bill
and
richie
were
walking
up
witcham
street
together
hter
on
bill
was
pushing
silver
after
first
building
and
then
tearing
down
the
dam
he
simply
did
not
have
the
energy
it
would
have
taken
to
get
silver
up
to
cruising
speed
both
boys
were
dirty
dishevelled
and
pretty
well
used
up
stan
had
asked
them
if
they
wanted
to
come
over
to
his
house
and
play
monopoly
or
parcheesi
or
something
but
none
of
them
wanted
to
it
was
getting
late
ben
sounding
tired
and
depressed
said
he
was
going
to
go
home
and
see
if
anybody
had
returned
his
library
books
he
had
some
hope
of
this
since
the
derry
library
insisted
on
writing
in
the
borrower
street
address
as
well
as
his
name
on
each
book
pocket
card
eddie
said
he
was
going
to
watch
the
rock
show
on
tv
because
neil
sedaka
was
going
to
be
on
and
he
wanted
to
see
if
neil
sedaka
was
a
negro
stan
told
eddie
not
to
be
so
stupid
neil
sedaka
was
white
you
could
tell
he
was
white
just
listening
to
him
eddie
claimed
you
couldn't
tell
anything
by
listening
to
them
until
last
year
he
had
been
positive
chuck
berry
was
white
but
when
he
was
on
bandstand
he
turned
out
to
be
a
negro
my
mother
still
thinks
he
white
so
that
one
good
thing
eddie
said
if
she
finds
out
he
a
negro
she
probably
won't
let
me
listen
to
his
songs
anymore
stan
bet
eddie
four
funnybooks
that
neil
sedaka
was
white
and
the
two
of
them
set
off
together
for
eddie
house
to
settle
the
issue
and
here
were
bill
and
richie
headed
in
a
direction
which
would
bring
them
to
bill
house
after
awhile
neither
of
them
talking
much
richie
found
himself
thinking
about
bill
story
of
the
picture
that
had
turned
its
head
and
winked
and
in
spite
of
his
tiredness
an
idea
came
to
him
it
was
crazy
but
it
also
held
a
certain
attraction
billy
me
bo
he
said
let
stop
for
awhile
take
five
i'm
dead
no
such
}}luc
bill
said
but
he
stopped
laid
silver
carefully
down
on
the
edge
of
the
green
theological
seminary
lawn
and
the
two
boys
sat
on
the
wide
stone
steps
which
led
up
to
the
rambling
red
victorian
structure
what
a
ddda
bill
said
glumly
there
were
dark
purplish
patches
under
his
eyes
his
face
looked
white
and
used
you
better
call
your
house
when
wwe
get
to
muhmine
so
your
f
folks
don't
go
bb
bananas
yeah
you
bet
listen
bill
richie
paused
for
a
moment
thinking
about
ben
mummy
eddie
leper
and
whatever
stan
had
almost
told
them
for
a
moment
something
swam
in
his
own
mind
something
about
that
paul
bunyan
statue
out
by
the
city
center
but
that
had
only
been
a
dream
for
god
sake
he
pushed
away
such
irrelevant
thoughts
and
plunged
let
go
up
to
your
house
what
do
you
say
take
a
look
in
georgie
room
i
want
to
see
that
picture
bill
looked
at
richie
shocked
he
tried
to
speak
but
could
not
his
stress
was
simply
too
great
he
settled
for
shaking
his
head
violently
richie
said
you
heard
eddie
story
and
ben
do
you
believe
what
they
said
i
don't
nuhnuhknow
i
thhink
they
mmmust
have
sub
seen
suhhomething
yeah
me
too
all
the
kids
that've
been
killed
around
here
i
think
all
of
them
would
have
had
stories
to
tell
too
the
only
difference
between
ben
and
eddie
and
those
other
kids
is
that
ben
and
eddie
didn't
get
caught
bill
raised
his
eyebrows
but
showed
no
great
surprise
richie
had
supposed
bill
would
have
taken
it
that
far
himself
he
couldn't
talk
so
good
but
he
was
no
dummy
so
now
dig
on
this
awhile
big
bill
richie
said
a
guy
could
dress
up
in
a
clown
suit
and
kill
kids
i
don't
know
why
he'd
want
to
but
nobody
can
tell
why
crazy
people
do
things
right
ruhruh
ruh
right
it
not
that
much
different
than
the
joker
in
a
batman
funnybook
just
hearing
his
ideas
out
loud
excited
richie
he
wondered
briefly
if
he
was
actually
trying
to
prove
something
or
just
throwing
up
a
smokescreen
of
words
so
he
could
see
that
room
that
picture
in
the
end
it
probably
didn't
matter
in
the
end
maybe
just
seeing
bill
eyes
light
up
with
their
own
excitement
was
enough
bbbut
whwh
where
does
the
pihhicture
fit
in
what
do
you
think
billy
in
a
low
voice
not
looking
at
richie
bill
said
he
didn't
think
it
had
anything
to
do
with
the
murders
i
think
it
was
juhjuhgeorgie
g
ghost
a
ghost
in
a
picture
bill
nodded
richie
thought
about
it
the
idea
of
ghosts
gave
his
child
mind
no
trouble
at
all
he
was
sure
there
were
such
things
his
parents
were
methodists
and
richie
went
to
church
every
sunday
and
to
thursdaynight
methodist
youth
fellowship
meetings
as
well
he
knew
a
great
deal
of
the
bible
already
and
he
knew
the
bible
believed
in
all
sorts
of
weird
stuff
according
to
the
bible
god
himself
was
at
least
onethird
ghost
and
that
was
just
the
beginning
you
could
tell
the
bible
believed
in
demons
because
jesus
threw
a
bunch
of
them
out
of
this
guy
real
chuckalicious
ones
too
when
jesus
asked
the
guy
who
had
them
what
his
name
was
the
demons
answered
and
told
him
to
go
join
the
foreign
legion
or
something
like
that
the
bible
believed
in
witches
or
else
why
would
it
say
thou
shall
not
suffer
a
witch
to
live
some
of
the
stuff
in
the
bible
was
even
better
than
the
stuff
in
the
horror
comics
people
getting
boiled
in
oil
or
hanging
themselves
like
judas
iscariot
the
story
about
how
wicked
king
ahaz
fell
off
the
tower
and
all
the
dogs
came
and
licked
up
his
blood
the
mass
babymurders
that
had
accompanied
the
births
of
both
moses
and
jesus
christ
guys
who
came
out
of
their
graves
or
flew
into
the
air
soldiers
who
witched
down
walls
prophets
who
saw
the
future
and
fought
monsters
all
of
that
was
in
the
bible
and
every
word
of
it
was
true
so
said
reverend
craig
and
so
said
richie
folks
and
so
said
richie
he
was
perfectly
willing
to
credit
the
possibility
of
bill
explanation
it
was
the
logic
which
troubled
him
but
you
said
you
were
scared
why
would
george
ghost
want
to
scare
you
bill
bill
put
a
hand
to
his
mouth
and
wiped
it
the
hand
was
trembling
slightly
hhe
probably
muhmuhmad
at
mmme
for
ggetting
him
kinhilled
it
was
my
fuhfuhfault
i
ssent
him
out
with
the
buh
buhbuh
he
was
incapable
of
getting
the
word
out
so
he
rocked
his
hand
in
the
air
instead
richie
nodded
to
show
he
understood
what
bill
meant
but
not
to
indicate
agreement
it
don't
think
so
he
said
if
you
stabbed
him
in
the
back
or
shot
him
that
would
be
different
or
even
if
you
like
gave
him
a
loaded
gun
that
belonged
to
your
dad
to
play
with
and
he
shot
himself
with
it
but
it
wasn't
a
gun
it
was
just
a
boat
you
didn't
want
to
hurt
him
in
fact
richie
raised
one
finger
and
waggled
it
at
bill
in
a
lawyerly
way
you
just
wanted
the
kid
to
have
a
little
fun
right
bill
thought
back
thought
desperately
hard
what
richie
had
just
said
had
made
him
feel
better
dout
george
death
for
the
first
time
in
months
but
there
was
a
part
of
him
which
insisted
with
quiet
firmness
that
he
was
not
supposed
to
feel
better
of
course
it
was
your
fault
that
part
of
him
insisted
not
entirely
maybe
but
at
least
partly
if
not
how
come
there
that
cold
place
on
the
couch
between
your
mother
and
father
if
not
how
come
no
one
ever
says
anything
at
the
supper
table
anymore
now
it
just
knives
and
forks
rattling
until
you
can't
take
it
anymore
and
ask
if
you
can
be
ehehehexcused
please
it
was
as
if
he
were
the
ghost
a
presence
that
spoke
and
moved
but
was
not
quite
heard
or
seen
a
thing
vaguely
sensed
but
still
not
accepted
as
real
he
did
not
like
the
thought
that
he
was
to
blame
but
the
only
alternative
he
could
think
of
to
explain
their
behavior
was
much
worse
that
all
the
love
and
attention
his
parents
had
given
him
before
had
somehow
been
the
result
of
george
presence
and
with
george
gone
there
was
nothing
for
him
and
all
of
that
had
happened
at
random
for
no
reason
at
all
and
if
you
put
your
ear
to
that
door
you
could
hear
the
winds
of
madness
blowing
outside
so
he
went
over
what
he
had
done
and
felt
and
said
on
the
day
georgie
had
died
part
of
him
hoping
that
what
richie
had
said
was
true
part
of
him
hoping
just
as
hard
it
was
not
he
hadn't
been
a
saint
of
a
big
brother
to
george
that
much
was
certain
they
had
had
fights
plenty
of
them
surely
there
had
been
one
that
day
no
no
fight
for
one
thing
bill
himself
had
still
been
feeling
too
punk
to
work
up
a
really
good
quarrel
with
george
he
had
been
sleeping
dreaming
something
dreaming
about
some
turtle
funny
little
animal
he
couldn't
remember
just
what
and
he
had
awakened
to
the
sound
of
the
diminishing
ran
outside
and
george
muttering
unhappily
to
himself
in
the
dining
room
he
asked
george
what
was
wrong
george
came
in
and
said
he
was
trying
to
make
a
paper
boat
from
the
directions
in
his
best
book
of
activities
but
it
kept
coming
out
wrong
bill
told
george
to
bring
his
book
and
sitting
next
to
richie
on
the
steps
leading
up
to
the
seminary
he
remembered
how
georgie
eyes
lit
up
when
the
paper
boat
came
out
right
and
how
good
that
look
had
made
him
feel
like
georgie
thought
he
was
a
real
hot
shit
a
straight
shooter
the
guy
who
could
do
it
until
it
got
done
making
him
feel
in
short
like
a
big
brother
the
boat
had
killed
george
but
richie
was
right
it
hadn't
been
like
handing
george
a
loaded
gun
to
play
with
bill
hadn't
known
what
was
going
to
happen
no
way
he
could
he
drew
a
deep
shuddering
breath
feeling
something
like
a
rock
something
he
hadn't
even
known
was
there
go
rolling
off
his
chest
all
at
once
he
felt
better
better
about
everything
he
opened
his
mouth
to
tell
richie
this
and
burst
into
tears
instead
alarmed
richie
put
an
arm
around
bill
shoulders
after
taking
a
quick
glance
around
to
make
sure
no
one
who
might
mistake
them
for
a
couple
of
fagolas
was
looking
you're
okay
he
said
you're
okay
billy
right
come
on
turn
off
the
waterworks

bill
sobbed
ththat

i

richie
said
if
you'd
wanted
to
scrub
hm
you
woulda
pushed
him
downstairs
or
something
richie
patted
bill
shoulder
clumsily
and
gave
him
a
hard
little
hug
before
letting
go
come
on
quit
bawlin
okay
you
sound
like
a
baby
little
by
little
bill
stopped
he
still
hurt
but
this
hurt
seemed
cleaner
as
if
he
had
cut
himself
open
and
taken
out
something
that
was
rotting
inside
him
and
that
feeling
of
relief
was
still
there
li
didn't
wwant
him
to
get
kuhkuhkilled
bill
repeated
and
ihif
yyyou
ttell
anybody
i
wwas
cccryin
i'll
bbbust
your
nnnose
won't

richie
said
don't
worry
he
was
your
brother
for
gosh
sake
if
my
brother
got
killed
i'd
cry
my
fuckin
head
off
yuh
yuh
you
ddon't
have
a
buhbrother
yeah
but
if
i
did
yyou
wwwoul
course
richie
paused
fixing
bill
with
a
wary
eye
trying
to
decide
if
bill
was
really
over
it
he
was
still
wiping
his
red
eyes
with
his
snotrag
but
richie
decided
he
probably
was
all
i
meant
was
that
i
don't
know
why
george
would
want
to
haunt
you
so
maybe
the
picture
got
something
to
do
with
well
with
that
other
the
clown
muhmuh
maybe
gg
george
dddoesn't
nuhnuh
know
maybe
hhe
ththinks
richie
understood
what
bill
was
trying
to
say
and
waved
it
aside
after
you
croak
you
know
everything
people
ever
thought
about
you
big
bill
he
spoke
with
the
indulgent
air
of
a
great
teacher
correcting
a
country
bumpkin
fatuous
ideas
it
in
the
bible
it
says
yea
even
though
we
can't
see
too
much
in
the
mirror
right
now
we
will
see
through
it
like
it
was
a
window
after
we
die
that
in
first
thessalonians
or
second
babylonians
i
forget
which
it
means
i
suhsuhsee
what
it
nmmean
bill
said
so
what
do
you
say
huh
let
go
up
to
his
room
and
take
a
look
maybe
we'll
get
a
clue
about
who
killing
all
the
kids
tm
ssscared
to
am
too
richie
said
thinking
it
was
just
more
sand
something
to
say
that
would
get
bill
moving
and
then
something
heavy
turned
over
in
his
midsection
and
he
discovered
it
was
true
he
was
scared
green
the
two
boys
slipped
into
the
denbrough
house
like
ghosts
bill
father
was
still
at
work
sharon
denbrough
was
in
the
kitchen
reading
a
paperback
at
the
kitchen
table
the
smell
of
supper
codfish
drifted
out
into
the
front
hall
richie
called
home
so
his
mom
would
know
he
wasn't
dead
just
at
bill
someone
there
mrs
denbrough
called
as
richie
put
the
phone
down
they
froze
eyeing
each
other
guiltily
then
bill
called
m
me
mom
and
rrrrr
richie
tozier
ma'am
richie
yelled

richie
mrs
denbrough
called

her

bill
whispered
that
enough
ssmall
talk
they
went
upstairs
and
down
the
hall
to
bill
room
it
was
boyneat
which
meant
it
would
have
given
the
mother
of
the
boy
in
question
only
a
mild
headache
to
look
at
the
shelves
were
stuffed
with
a
helterskelter
collection
of
books
and
comics
there
were
more
comics
plus
a
few
models
and
toys
and
a
stack
of
s
on
the
desk
there
was
also
an
old
underwood
office
model
typewriter
on
it
his
folks
had
given
it
to
him
for
christmas
two
years
ago
and
bill
sometimes
wrote
stories
on
it
he
did
this
a
bit
more
frequently
since
george
death
the
pretending
seemed
to
ease
his
mind
there
was
a
phonograph
on
the
floor
across
from
the
bed
with
a
pile
of
folded
clothes
stacked
on
the
lid
bill
put
the
clothes
in
the
drawers
of
his
bureau
and
then
took
the
records
from
the
desk
he
shuffled
through
them
picking
half
a
dozen
he
put
them
on
the
phonograph
fat
spindle
and
turned
the
machine
on
the
fleetwoods
started
singing
come
softly

mmy
room
cccome
on
george
room
was
across
the
hall
the
door
was
shut
richie
looked
at
it
and
licked
his
lips
they
don't
keep
it
locked
he
whispered
to
bill
suddenly
he
found
himself
hoping
it
was
locked
suddenly
he
was
having
trouble
believing
this
had
been
his
idea
bill
his
face
pale
shook
his
head
and
turned
the
knob
he
stepped
in
and
looked
back
at
richie
after
a
moment
richie
followed
bill
shut
the
door
behind
them
muffling
the
fleetwoods
richie
jumped
a
little
at
the
soft
snick
of
the
latch
he
looked
around
fearful
and
intensely
curious
at
the
same
tune
the
first
thing
he
noticed
was
the
dry
mustiness
of
the
air
no
one
opened
a
window
in
here
for
a
long
time
he
thought
heck
no
one
breathed
in
here
for
a
long
time
that
really
what
it
feels
like
he
shuddered
a
little
at
the
thought
and
licked
his
lips
again
his
eye
fell
on
george
bed
and
he
thought
of
george
sleeping
now
under
a
comforter
of
earth
in
mount
hope
cemetery
rotting
there
his
hands
not
folded
because
you
needed
two
hands
to
do
the
old
folding
routine
and
george
had
been
buried
with
only
one
a
little
sound
escaped
richie
throat
bill
turned
and
looked
at
him
enquiringly
you're
right
richie
said
huskily
it
spooky
in
here
i
don’t
see
how
you
could
stand
to
come
in
alone
hhe
was
my
bruh
brother
bill
said
simply
sometimes
i
w
w
want
to
is
aall
there
were
posters
on
the
walls
littlekid
posters
one
showed
tom
terrific
the
cartoon
character
on
captain
kangaroo
program
tom
was
springing
over
the
head
and
clutching
hands
of
crabby
appleton
who
was
of
course
rotten
to
the
core
another
showed
donald
duck
nephews
huey
louie
and
dewie
marching
off
into
the
wilderness
in
their
junior
woodchucks
coonskin
caps
a
third
which
george
had
colored
himself
showed
mr
do
holding
up
traffic
so
a
bunch
of
little
kids
headed
for
school
could
cross
the
street
mr
do
says
wait
for
the
crossing
guard]
it
said
underneath
kid
wasn't
too
cool
about
staying
in
the
lines
richie
thought
and
then
shuddered
the
kid
was
never
going
to
get
any
better
at
it
either
richie
looked
at
the
table
by
the
window
mrs
denbrough
had
stood
up
all
of
george
rankcards
there
halfopen
looking
at
them
knowing
there
would
never
be
more
knowing
that
george
had
died
before
he
could
stay
in
the
lines
when
he
colored
knowing
his
life
had
ended
irrevocably
and
eternally
with
only
those
few
kindergarten
and
firstgrade
rankcards
all
the
idiot
truth
of
death
crashed
home
to
richie
for
the
first
time
it
was
as
if
a
large
iron
safe
had
fallen
into
his
brain
and
buried
itself
there
j
could
die
his
mind
screamed
at
him
suddenly
in
tones
of
betrayed
horror
anybody
could
anybody
could
boy
oh
bo
he
said
in
a
shaky
voice
he
could
manage
no
more
yea
bill
said
in
a
near
whisper
he
sat
down
on
george
bed
look
richie
followed
bill
pointing
finger
and
saw
the
photo
album
lying
closed
on
the
floor
my
photographs
richie
read
george
elmer
denbrough
age
age
his
mind
shrieked
in
those
same
tones
of
shrill
betrayal
age
forever
anybody
could
shit
fucking
anybody
it
was
ohohopen
bill
said
b
before
so
it
closed
richie
said
uneasily
he
sat
down
on
the
bed
beside
bill
and
looked
at
the
photo
album
lots
of
books
close
on
their
own
the
pppages
maybe
but
nnot
the
cuhcuhcover
it
cclosed
itself
he
looked
at
richie
solemnly
his
eyes
very
dark
in
his
pale
tired
face
bbut
it
wuhwuh
wants
yyou
to
oh
open
it
up
again
that
what
i
ththink
richie
got
up
and
walked
slowly
over
to
the
photograph
album
it
lay
at
the
base
of
a
window
screened
with
light
curtains
looking
out
he
could
see
the
apple
tree
in
the
denbrough
back
yard
a
swing
rocked
slowly
back
and
forth
from
one
gnarled
black
limb
he
looked
down
at
george
book
again
a
dried
maroon
stain
colored
the
thickness
of
the
pages
in
the
middle
of
the
book
it
could
have
been
old
ketchup
sure
it
was
easy
enough
to
see
george
looking
at
his
photo
album
while
eating
a
hot
dog
or
a
big
sloppy
hamburger
he
takes
a
big
bite
and
some
ketchup
squirts
out
onto
the
book
little
kids
were
always
doing
spasmoid
stuff
like
that
it
could
be
ketchup
but
richie
knew
it
was
not
he
touched
the
album
briefly
and
then
drew
his
hand
away
it
felt
cold
it
had
been
lying
in
a
place
where
the
strong
summer
sunlight
only
slightly
filtered
by
those
light
curtains
would
have
been
falling
on
it
all
day
but
it
felt
cold
well
i'll
just
leave
it
alone
richie
thought
i
don't
want
to
look
in
his
stupid
old
album
anyway
see
a
lot
of
people
i
don't
know
i
think
maybe
i'll
tell
bill
i
changed
my
mind
and
we
can
go
to
his
room
and
read
comic
books
for
awhile
and
then
i'll
go
home
and
eat
supper
and
go
to
bed
early
because
i'm
pretty
tired
and
when
i
wake
up
tomorrow
morning
i'm
sure
i'll
be
sure
that
stuff
was
just
ketchup
that
just
what
i'll
do
yowza
so
he
opened
the
album
with
hands
that
seemed
a
thousand
miles
away
from
him
at
the
end
of
long
plastic
arms
and
he
looked
at
the
faces
and
places
in
george
album
the
aunts
the
uncles
the
babies
the
houses
the
old
fords
and
studebakers
the
telephone
lines
the
mailboxes
the
picket
fences
the
wheelruts
with
muddy
water
in
them
the
ferris
wheel
at
the
esty
county
fair
the
standpipe
the
ruins
of
the
kitchener
ironworks
his
fingers
flipped
faster
and
faster
and
suddenly
the
pages
were
blank
he
turned
back
not
wanting
to
but
unable
to
help
himself
here
was
a
picture
of
downtown
derry
main
street
and
canal
street
from
around
and
beyond
it
there
was
nothing
there
no
school
picture
of
george
in
here
richie
said
he
looked
at
bill
with
a
mixture
of
relief
and
exasperation
what
kind
of
line
were
you
handing
me
big
bill
w
w
what
this
picture
of
downtown
in
the
olden
days
is
the
last
one
in
the
book
all
the
rest
of
the
pages
are
blank
bill
got
off
the
bed
and
joined
richie
he
looked
at
the
picture
of
downtown
derry
as
it
had
been
almost
thirty
years
ago
oldfashioned
cars
and
trucks
oldfashioned
streetlights
with
clusters
of
globes
like
big
white
grapes
pedestrians
by
the
canal
caught
in
mid
stride
by
the
click
of
a
shutter
he
turned
the
page
and
just
as
richie
had
said
there
was
nothing
no
wait
not
quite
nothing
there
was
one
studio
corner
the
sort
of
item
you
use
to
mount
photographs
tt
wwwas
here
he
said
and
tapped
the
studio
corner
llook
jeepers
what
do
you
think
happened
to
it
i
ddon't
nuhnuhknow
bill
had
taken
the
album
from
richie
and
was
now
holding
it
on
his
own
lap
he
turned
back
through
the
pages
looking
for
george
picture
he
gave
up
after
a
minute
but
the
pages
did
not
they
turned
themselves
flipping
slowly
but
steadily
with
big
deliberate
riffling
sounds
bill
and
richie
looked
at
each
other
wideeyed
and
then
back
down
it
arrived
at
that
last
picture
again
and
the
pages
stopped
turning
here
was
downtown
derry
in
sepia
tones
the
city
as
it
had
been
long
before
either
bill
or
richie
had
been
born
sa
richie
said
suddenly
and
took
the
album
back
from
bill
there
was
no
fear
in
his
voice
now
and
his
face
was
suddenly
full
of
wonder
holy
shit
w
what
what
ihihis
it
us
that
what
it
is
holyjeezlycrow
loo
bill
took
one
side
of
the
book
bent
over
it
sharing
it
they
looked
like
boys
at
choir
practice
bill
drew
in
breath
sharply
and
richie
knew
he
had
seen
it
too
caught
under
the
shiny
surface
of
this
old
blackandwhite
photograph
two
small
boys
were
walking
along
main
street
toward
the
point
where
main
and
center
intersected
the
point
where
the
canal
went
underground
for
a
mile
and
a
half
or
so
the
two
boys
showed
up
clearly
against
the
low
concrete
wall
at
the
edge
of
the
ganal
one
was
wearing
knickers
the
other
was
wearing
something
that
looked
almost
like
a
sailor
suit
a
tweed
cap
was
perched
on
his
head
they
were
turned
in
threequarter
profile
toward
the
camera
looking
at
something
on
the
far
side
of
the
street
the
boy
in
the
knickers
was
richie
tozier
beyond
a
doubt
and
the
boy
in
the
sailor
suit
and
the
tweed
cap
was
stuttering
bill
they
stared
at
themselves
in
a
picture
almost
three
times
as
old
as
they
were
hypnotized
the
inside
of
richie
mouth
suddenly
felt
as
dry
as
dust
and
as
smooth
as
glass
a
few
steps
ahead
of
the
boys
in
the
picture
there
was
a
man
holding
the
brim
of
his
fedora
his
topcoat
frozen
forever
as
it
flapped
out
behind
him
in
a
sudden
gust
of
wind
there
were
model
ts
on
the
street
a
pierce
arrow
chevrolets
with
running
boards
eii
ddon't
buhbuhbelieve
bill
began
and
that
was
when
the
picture
began
to
move
the
modelt
that
should
have
remained
eternally
in
the
middle
of
the
intersection
or
at
least
until
the
chemicals
in
the
old
photo
finally
dissolved
completely
passed
through
it
a
haze
of
exhaust
puffing
out
of
its
tailpipe
it
went
on
toward
upmile
hill
a
small
white
hand
shot
out
of
the
driver
side
window
and
signalled
a
left
turn
it
swung
onto
court
street
and
passed
beyond
the
photo
white
border
and
so
out
of
sight
the
piercearrow
the
chevrolets
the
packards
they
all
began
to
roll
along
dodging
their
separate
ways
through
the
intersection
after
twentyeight
years
or
so
the
skirt
of
the
man
topcoat
finally
finished
its
flap
he
settled
his
hat
more
firmly
on
his
head
and
walked
on
the
two
boys
completed
their
turn
coming
full
face
and
a
moment
later
richie
saw
what
they
had
been
looking
at
as
a
mangy
dog
came
trotting
across
center
street
the
boy
in
the
sailor
suit
bill
raised
two
fingers
to
the
corners
of
his
mouth
and
whistled
stunned
beyond
any
ability
to
move
or
think
richie
realized
he
could
hear
the
whistle
could
hear
the
cars
irregular
sewingmachine
engines
the
sounds
were
faint
like
sounds
heard
through
thick
glass
but
they
were
there
the
dog
glanced
toward
the
two
boys
then
trotted
on
the
boys
glanced
at
each
other
and
laughed
like
chipmunks
they
started
to
walk
on
and
then
the
richie
in
knickers
grabbed
bill
arm
and
pointed
toward
the
canal
they
turned
in
that
direction
no
richie
thought
don't
do
that
don't
they
went
to
the
low
concrete
wall
and
suddenly
the
clown
popped
up
over
its
edge
like
a
horrible
jackinthebox
a
clown
with
georgie
denbrough
face
his
hair
slicked
back
his
mouth
a
hideous
grin
full
of
bleeding
greasepaint
his
eyes
black
holes
one
hand
clutched
three
balloons
on
a
string
with
the
other
he
reached
for
the
boy
in
the
sailor
suit
and
seized
his
neck
nuhnuhno
bill
cried
and
reached
for
the
picture
reached
into
the
picture
stop
it
bill
richie
shouted
and
grabbed
for
him
he
was
almost
too
late
he
saw
the
tips
of
bill
fingers
go
through
the
surface
of
the
photograph
and
into
hat
other
world
he
saw
the
fingertips
go
from
the
warm
pink
of
living
flesh
to
the
mummified
cream
color
that
passed
for
white
in
old
photos
at
the
same
tune
they
became
small
and
disconnected
it
was
like
the
peculiar
optical
illusion
one
sees
when
one
thrusts
a
hand
into
a
glass
bowl
of
water
the
part
of
the
hand
underwater
seems
to
be
floating
disembodied
inches
away
from
the
part
which
is
still
out
of
the
water
a
series
of
diagonal
cuts
slashed
across
bill
fingers
at
the
point
where
they
ceased
being
his
fingers
and
became
photofingers
it
was
as
if
he
had
stuck
his
hand
into
the
blades
of
a
fan
instead
of
into
a
picture
richie
seized
his
forearm
and
gave
a
tremendous
yank
they
both
fell
over
george
album
hit
the
floor
and
snapped
iself
shut
with
a
dry
clap
bill
stuck
his
fingers
in
his
mouth
tears
of
pain
stood
in
his
eyes
richie
could
see
blood
running
down
his
palm
to
his
wrist
in
thin
streams
let
me
see
he
said
hu
hurts
bill
said
he
held
his
hand
out
to
richie
palm
down
there
were
ladderlike
slashcuts
running
up
his
index
second
and
third
fingers
the
pinky
had
barely
touched
the
surface
of
the
photograph
if
it
had
a
surface
and
although
that
finger
had
not
been
cut
bill
told
richie
later
that
the
nai
had
been
neatly
clipped
as
if
with
a
pair
of
manicurist
scissors
jesus
bill
richie
said
bandaids
that
was
all
he
could
think
of
god
they
had
been
lucky
if
he
hadn't
pulled
bill
arm
when
he
did
his
fingers
might
have
been
amputated
instead
of
just
badly
cut
we
got
to
fix
those
up
your
mother
can
nehnehnever
mmind
m
my
mubhuther
bill
said
he
grabbed
the
photo
album
again
spilling
drops
of
blood
on
the
floor
don't
open
that
again
richie
cried
grabbing
frantically
at
bill
shoulder
jesus
christ
billy
you
almost
lost
your
finger
bill
shook
him
off
he
flipped
through
the
pages
and
there
was
a
grim
determination
on
his
face
that
scared
richie
more
than
anything
else
bill
eyes
looked
almost
mad
his
wounded
fingers
printed
george
album
with
new
blood
it
didn't
look
like
ketchup
yet
but
when
it
had
a
little
time
to
dry
it
would
of
course
it
would
and
here
was
the
downtown
scene
again
the
modelft
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
intersection
the
other
cars
were
frozen
in
the
places
where
they
had
been
before
the
man
walking
toward
the
intersection
held
the
brim
of
his
fedora
his
coat
once
more
belled
out
in
midflap
the
two
boys
were
gone
there
were
no
boys
in
the
picture
anywhere
but
look
richie
whispered
and
pointed
he
was
careful
to
keep
the
tip
of
his
finger
well
away
from
the
picture
an
arc
showed
just
over
the
low
concrete
wall
at
the
edge
of
the
canal
the
top
of
something
round
something
like
a
balloon
they
got
out
of
george
room
just
in
time
bill
mother
was
a
voice
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
a
shadow
on
the
wall
have
you
boys
been
wrestling
she
asked
sharply
i
heard
a
thud
just
a
lihlih
little
mmom
bill
threw
a
sharp
glance
at
richie
be
quiet
it
said
well
i
want
you
to
stop
it
i
thought
the
ceiling
was
going
to
come
right
down
on
my
head
wwwe
will
they
heard
her
go
back
toward
the
front
of
the
house
bill
had
wrapped
his
handkerchief
around
his
bkeding
hand
it
was
turning
red
and
in
a
moment
would
start
to
drip
the
boys
went
down
to
the
bathroom
where
bill
held
his
hand
under
the
faucet
until
the
bleeding
stopped
cleaned
the
cuts
looked
thin
but
cruelly
deep
looking
at
their
white
lips
and
he
red
meat
just
inside
them
made
richie
feel
sick
to
his
stomach
he
wrapped
them
with
band
aids
as
fast
as
he
could
hhhurts
like
hell
bill
said
well
why'd
you
want
to
go
and
put
your
hand
in
there
you
wet
end
bill
looked
solemnly
at
the
rings
of
bandaids
on
his
fingers
then
up
at
richie
hiit
was
the
cluhhown
he
said
it
wwwas
the
cclown
pretending
to
be
juhjuhgeorge
that
right
richie
said
like
it
was
the
clown
pretending
to
be
the
mummy
when
ben
saw
it
like
it
was
the
clown
pretending
to
be
that
sick
bum
eddie
saw
the
luhluh
leper
right
but
ihis
it
rrreally
a
cluhcluhclown
tt
a
monster
richie
said
flatly
some
kind
of
monster
some
kind
of
monster
right
here
in
derry
and
it
killing
kids
on
a
saturday
not
long
after
the
incident
of
the
dam
in
the
barrens
mr
nell
and
the
picture
that
moved
richie
ben
and
beverly
marsh
came
face
to
face
with
not
one
monster
but
two
and
they
paid
to
do
it
richie
did
anyway
these
monsters
were
scary
but
not
really
dangerous
they
stalked
their
victims
on
the
screen
of
the
aladdin
theater
while
richie
ben
and
bev
watched
from
the
balcony
one
of
the
monsters
was
a
werewolf
played
by
michael
landon
and
he
was
cool
because
even
when
he
was
the
werewolf
he
still
had
sort
of
a
duck
ass
haircut
the
other
was
this
smashedup
hotrodder
played
by
gary
conway
he
was
brought
back
to
life
by
a
descendant
of
victor
frankenstein
who
fed
all
parts
he
didn't
need
to
a
bunch
of
alligators
he
kept
in
the
basement
also
on
the
program
a
movietone
newsreel
that
showed
the
latest
paris
fashions
and
the
latest
vanguard
rocket
explosions
at
cape
canaveral
two
warner
brothers
cartoons
one
popeye
cartoon
and
a
chilly
willy
cartoon
for
some
reason
the
hat
chilly
willy
wore
always
cracked
richie
up
and
prevues
of
coming
attractions
the
coming
attractions
included
two
pictures
richie
immediately
put
on
his
gottasee
list
married
a
monster
from
outer
space
and
the
blob
ben
was
very
quiet
during
the
show
ole
haystack
had
nearly
been
spotted
by
henry
belch
and
victor
earlier
and
richie
assumed
that
was
all
that
was
troubling
him
ben
however
had
forgotten
all
about
the
creeps
they
were
sitting
close
to
the
screen
down
below
chucking
popcorn
boxes
at
each
other
and
hooting
beverly
was
the
reason
for
his
silence
her
nearness
was
so
overwhelming
that
he
was
almost
ill
with
it
his
body
would
break
out
in
goosebumps
and
then
if
she
should
so
much
as
shift
in
her
seat
his
skin
would
flash
hot
as
if
with
a
tropical
fever
when
her
hand
brushed
his
reaching
for
the
popcorn
he
trembled
with
exaltation
he
thought
later
that
those
three
hours
in
the
dark
next
to
beverly
had
been
both
the
longest
and
shortest
hours
of
his
life
richie
unaware
that
ben
was
in
deep
throes
of
calflove
was
feeling
just
as
fine
as
paint
in
his
book
the
only
thing
any
better
than
a
couple
of
francis
the
talking
mule
pictures
was
a
couple
of
horror
pictures
in
a
theater
filled
with
kids
all
of
them
yelling
and
screaming
at
the
gory
parts
he
certainly
did
not
connect
any
of
the
goingsons
in
the
two
lowbudget
americar
international
pictures
they
were
watching
with
what
was
going
on
in
town
not
then
at
least
he
had
seen
the
twin
shock
show
saturday
matinee
ad
in
the
news
on
friday
morning
and
had
almost
immediately
forgotten
how
badly
he
had
slept
the
night
before
and
how
he
had
finally
gotten
up
and
turned
on
the
light
in
his
closet
a
real
baby
trick
for
sure
but
he
hadn't
been
able
to
get
a
wink
of
sleep
until
he'd
done
it
but
by
the
following
morning
things
had
seemed
normal
again
well
almost
he
began
to
think
that
maybe
he
and
bill
had
just
shared
a
hallucination
of
course
the
cuts
on
bill
fingers
weren't
a
hallucination
but
maybe
they'd
just
been
papercuts
from
some
of
the
sheets
in
georgie
album
pretty
thick
paper
could
of
been
maybe
besides
there
was
no
law
saying
he
had
to
spend
the
next
ten
years
thinking
about
it
was
there
nope
and
so
bllowing
an
experience
that
might
well
have
sent
an
adult
running
for
the
nearest
headshrinker
richie
tozier
got
up
ate
a
giant
pancake
breakfast
saw
the
ad
for
the
two
horror
movies
on
the
amusements
page
of
the
paper
checked
his
funds
found
them
a
ittle
low
well
nonexistent
might
actually
have
been
a
better
word
and
began
to
pester
his
father
for
chores
his
dad
who
had
come
to
the
table
already
wearing
his
white
dentist
tunic
put
down
the
sports
pages
and
poured
himself
a
second
cup
of
coffee
he
was
a
pleasantlooking
man
with
a
rather
thin
face
he
wore
steel+rimmed
spectacles
was
developing
a
bald
spot
at
the
back
of
his
head
and
would
die
of
cancer
of
the
larynx
in
he
looked
at
the
ad
to
which
richie
was
pointing
horror
movie
wentworth
tozier
said
yeah
richie
said
grinning
feel
like
you
have
to
go
wentworth
tozier
said
yeah
feel
like
you'll
probably
die
in
convulsions
of
disappointment
if
you
don't
get
to
see
those
two
trashy
movies
yeah
yeah
i
would
i
know
i
would
graaaa
richie
fell
out
of
his
chair
onto
the
floor
clutching
his
throat
his
tongue
sticking
out
this
was
richie
admittedly
peculiar
way
of
turning
on
the
charm
oh
god
richie
will
you
please
stop
it
his
mother
asked
him
from
the
stove
where
she
was
frying
him
a
couple
of
eggs
to
top
off
the
pancakes
gee
rich
his
father
said
as
richie
got
back
into
his
chair
i
guess
i
must
have
forgotten
to
pay
you
your
allowance
on
monday
that
the
only
reason
i
can
think
of
for
you
needing
more
money
on
friday
well
gone
well
that
an
extremely
deep
subject
for
a
boy
with
such
a
shallow
mind
wentworth
tozier
said
he
put
his
elbow
on
the
table
and
then
cupped
his
chin
on
the
palm
of
his
hand
regarding
his
only
son
with
what
appeared
to
be
deep
fascination
where'd
it
go
richie
immediately
fell
into
the
voice
of
toodles
the
english
butler
why
i
spent
it
didn't
i
guv'nor
pippip
cheerio
and
al
that
rot

of
a
sticky
wicket
aywot
bit
of
a
wet
hedgehog
wot

bit
of
a
bit
of
a
pile
of
bullshit
went
said
amiably
and
reached
for
the
strawberry
preserves
spare
me
the
vulgarity
at
the
breakfast
table
if
you
please
maggie
tozier
said
to
her
husband
as
she
brought
richie
eggs
over
to
the
table
and
to
richie
i
don't
know
why
you
want
to
fill
your
head
up
with
such
awful
junk
anyway
aw
mo
richie
said
he
was
outwardly
crushed
inwardly
jubilant
he
could
read
both
of
his
parents
like
books
wellworn
and
wellloved
books
and
he
was
pretty
sure
he
was
going
to
get
what
he
wanted
chores
and
permission
to
go
to
the
show
saturday
afternoon
went
leaned
forward
toward
richie
and
smiled
widely
i
think
i
have
you
right
where
i
want
you
he
said
ts
that
right
dad
richie
said
and
smiled
back
a
trifle
uneasily
oh
yes
you
know
our
lawn
richie
you
are
familiar
with
our
lawn
indeed
i
am
guv'no
richie
said
becoming
toodles
again
or
trying
to
bit
shaggy
aywo
wotwo
went
agreed
and
you
richie
will
remedy
that
condition
twill
you
will
mow
it
richie
okay
dad
sure
richie
said
but
a
terrible
suspicion
had
suddenly
blossomed
in
his
mind
maybe
his
dad
didn't
mean
just
the
front
lawn
wentworth
tozier
smile
widened
to
a
predatory
shark
grin
all
of
it
o
idiot
child
of
my
loins
front
back
sides
and
when
you
finish
i
will
cross
your
palm
with
two
green
pieces
of
paper
with
the
likeness
of
george
washington
on
one
side
and
a
picture
of
a
pyramid
o'ertopped
with
the
ever
watching
oculary
on
the
other
don't
get
you
dad
richie
said
but
he
was
afraid
he
did
two
bucks
two
bucks
for
the
whole
lawn
richie
cried
genuinely
wounded
it
the
biggest
lawn
on
the
block
jeez
da
went
sighed
and
picked
the
paper
up
again
richie
could
read
the
front
page
headline
missing
boy
prompts
new
fears
he
thought
briefly
of
george
denbrough
strange
scrapbook
but
that
had
surely
been
a
hallucination
and
even
if
it
hadn't
been
that
was
yesterday
and
this
was
today
guess
you
didn't
want
to
see
those
movies
as
bad
as
you
thought
went
said
from
behind
the
paper
a
moment
later
his
eyes
appeared
over
the
top
studying
richie
studying
him
a
trifle
smugly
in
truth
studying
him
the
way
a
man
with
four
of
a
kind
studies
his
poker
opponent
over
the
fan
of
his
cards
when
the
clark
twins
do
it
all
you
give
them
two
dollars
eac
that
true
went
admitted
but
as
far
as
i
know
they
don't
want
to
go
to
the
movies
tomorrow
or
if
they
do
they
must
have
funds
sufficient
to
the
occasion
because
they
haven't
popped
by
to
check
the
state
of
the
herbiage
surrounding
our
domicile
lately
you
on
the
other
hand
do
want
to
go
and
find
yourself
lacking
the
funds
to
do
so
that
pressure
you
feel
in
your
midsection
may
be
the
five
pancakes
and
two
eggs
you
ate
for
leakfast
richie
or
it
may
just
be
the
barrel
i
have
you
over
wot
wo
went
eyes
submerged
behind
the
paper
again
he
blackmailing
me
richie
said
to
his
mother
who
was
eating
dry
toast
she
was
trying
to
lose
weight
again
this
is
blackmail
i
just
hope
you
know
that
yes
dear
i
know
that
his
mother
said
there

on
your
chin
richie
wiped
the
egg
off
his
chin
three
bucks
if
i
have
it
all
done
when
you
get
home
tonight
he
asked
the
newspaper
his
father
eyes
appeared
again
briefly.twofifty
oh

jack
benny
my
idol

from
behind
the
paper

up
your
mind
richie
i
want

richie
said
and
sighed
when
your
folks
had
you
by
the
balls
they
really
knew
how
to
squeeze
it
was
pretty
chuckalicious
when
you
thought
it
over
as
he
mowed
he
practiced
his
voices
he
finished
front
back
and
sides
by
three
o'clock
friday
afternoon
and
began
saturday
with
two
dollars
and
fifty
cents
in
his
jeans
pretty
damn
near
a
fortune
he
called
bill
up
but
bill
told
him
glumly
that
he
had
to
go
up
to
bangor
and
take
some
kind
of
speech
therapy
test
richie
sympathized
and
then
added

his
best
stuttering
bill
voice
gggive

£f

my

and
hung
up
he
called

but
eddie
sounded
even
more
depressed
than
bill
his
mother
had
gotten
them
each
a
fullday
buspass
he
sad
and
they
were
going
to
visit
eddie

his
third
call
was
to
stan
the
man
but
stan
was
in
dutch
with
his
folks
for
breaking
their
picture
window
he
had
been
playing
flyingsaucer
with
a
pieplate
and
it
took
a
bad
bank
keerash
he
had
to
do
chores
all
weekend
and
probably
next
weekend
too
richie
commiserated
and
then
asked
stan
if
he
would
be
coming
down
to
the
barrens
next
week
stan
said
he
guessed
so
if
his
father
didn't
decide
to
ground
him
or
something
jeez
stan
it
was
just
a
window
richie
said
yeah
but
a
big
one
stan
said
and
hung
up
richie
started
to
leave
the
living
room
then
thought
of
ben
hanscom
he
thumbed
through
the
telephone
book
and
found
a
listing
for
an
arlene
hanscom
since
she
was
the
only
lady
hanscom
among
the
four
listed
richie
figured
it
had
to
be
ben
number
and
called
td
like
to
go
but
i
already
spent
my
allowance
ben
said
he
sounded
depressed
and
ashamed
by
the
admission
he
had
in
fact
spent
it
all
on
candy
soda
chips
and
beefjerky
strips
richie
who
was
rolling
in
dough
and
who
didn't
like
to
go
to
the
movies
alone
said
i
got
plenty
of
money

can
gimme
owesies

yeah
really
you'd

that
sure
richie
said
puzzled
why
not
okay
ben
said
happily
okay
that'd
be
great
two
horror
movies
did
you
say
one

a
werewolf
picture
yeah

jove

your
pants
ben
laughed
ti
see
you
out
in
front
of
the
aladdin
okay
yeah
great
richie
hung
up
and
looked
at
the
phone
thoughtfully
it
suddenly
occurred
to
him
that
ben
hanscom
was
lonely
and
that
in
tum
made
him
feel
rather
heroic
he
was
whistling
as
he
ran
upstairs
to
get
some
comics
to
read
before
the
show
the
day
was
sunny
breezy
and
cool
richie
jived
along
center
street
toward
the
aladdin
popping
his
fingers
and
singing
rockin
robin
under
his
breath
he
was
feeling
good
going
to
the
movies
always
made
him
feel
good
he
loved
that
magic
world
those
magic
dreams
he
felt
sorry
for
anyone
who
had
dull
duties
to
discharge
on
such
a
day
bill
with
his
speech
therapy
eddie
with
his
aunts
poor
old
stan
the
man
who
would
be
spending
the
afternoon
scraping
down
the
frontporch
steps
or
sweeping
the
garage
because
the
pieplate
he'd
been
throwing
around
swept
right
when
it
was
supposed
to
sweep
left
richie
had
his
yoyo
tucked
in
his
back
pocket
and
now
he
took
it
out
and
tried
again
to
get
it
to
sleep
this
was
an
ability
richie
lusted
to
acquire
but
so
far
no
soap
the
crazy
l'il
fucker
just
wouldn't
do
it
either
it
went
down
and
popped
right
back
up
or
it
went
down
and
dropped
dead
at
the
end
of
its
string
halfway
up
center
street
hill
he
saw
a
girl
in
a
beige
pleated
skirt
and
a
white
sleeveless
blouse
sitting
on
a
bench
outside
shock
drug
store
she
was
eating
what
looked
like
a
pistachio
icecream
cone
bright
redauburn
hair
its
highlights
seeming
coppery
or
sometimes
almost
blonde
hung
down
to
her
shoulderblades
richie
knew
only
one
girl
with
hair
of
that
particular
shade
it
was
beverly
marsh
richie
liked
bev
a
lot
well
he
liked
her
but
not
that
way
he
admired
her
looks
and
knew
he
wasn't
alone
girls
like
sally
mueller
and
greta
bowie
hated
beverly
like
fire
still
too
young
to
understand
how
they
could
have
everything
else
so
easily
and
still
have
to
compete
in
the
matter
of
looks
with
a
girl
who
lived
in
one
of
those
shimmy
apartments
on
lower
main
street
but
mostly
he
liked
her
because
she
was
tough
and
had
a
really
good
sense
of
humor
also
she
usually
had
cigarettes
he
liked
her
in
short
because
she
was
a
good
guy
still
he
had
once
or
twice
caught
himself
wondering
what
color
underwear
she
was
wearing
under
her
small
selection
of
rather
faded
skirts
and
that
was
not
the
sort
of
thing
you
wondered
about
the
other
guys
was
it
and
richie
had
to
admit
she
was
one
hell
of
a
pretty
guy
approaching
the
bench
where
she
sat
eating
her
ice
cream
richie
belted
an
invisible
topcoat
around
his
middle
pulled
down
an
invisible
slouch
hat
and
pretended
to
be
humphrey
bogart
adding
the
correct
voice
he
became
humphrey
bogart
at
least
to
himself
to
others
he
would
have
sounded
like
richie
tozier
with
a
mild
headcold
hello
shweetheart
he
said
gliding
up
to
the
bench
where
she
was
sitting
and
looking
out
at
the
traffic
no
sensh
waitin
for
a
bus
here
the
nazish
have
cut
off
our
retreat
the
last
plane
leavesh
at
midnight
you
be
on
it
he
needsh
you
shweetheart
so
do
i
but
i'll
get
along
shomehow
hi
richie
bev
said
and
when
she
turned
toward
him
he
saw
a
purpleblackish
bruise
on
her
right
cheek
like
the
shadow
of
a
crow
wing
he
was
again
struck
by
her
good
looks
only
it
occurred
to
him
now
that
she
might
actually
be
beautiful
it
had
never
really
occurred
to
him
until
that
moment
that
there
might
be
beautiful
girls
outside
of
the
movies
or
that
he
himself
might
know
one
perhaps
it
was
the
bruise
that
allowed
him
to
see
the
possibility
of
her
beauty
an
essential
contrast
a
particular
flaw
which
first
drew
attention
to
itself
and
then
somehow
denned
the
rest
the
grayblue
eyes
the
naturally
red
lips
the
creamy
unblemished
child
skin
there
was
a
tiny
spray
of
freckles
across
her
nose
see
anything
green
she
asked
tossing
her
head
pertly
you
shweethear
richie
said
you've
turned
green
ash
limberger
cheese
but

richie
that

sound
like
humphrey
bogart
at
all
but
she
smiled
a
little
as
she
said
it
richie
sat
down
next
to
her
you
going
to
the
movies
don't
have
any
money
she
said
can
i
see
your
yoyo
he
handed
it
over
i
oughtta
take
it
bac
he
told
her
it
supposed
to
sleep
but
it
doesn't
i
got
japped
she
poked
her
finger
through
the
loop
of
string
and
richie
pushed
his
glasses
up
on
the
bridge
of
his
nose
so
he
could
watch
what
she
was
doing
better
she
turned
her
hand
over
palm
toward
the
sky
the
duncan
yoyo
tucked
neatly
into
the
valley
of
flesh
formed
by
her
cupped
hand
she
rolled
the
yoyo
off
her
index
finger
it
went
down
to
the
end
of
its
string
and
fell
asleep
when
she
twitched
her
fingers
in
a
comeon
gesture
it
promptly
woke
up
and
climbed
its
string
to
her
palm
again
oh
bugdung
look
at
that
richie
said
that
kid
stuff
bev
said
watch
this
she
snapped
the
yoyo
down
again
she
let
it
sleep
for
a
moment
and
then
walked
the
dog
with
it
in
a
smart
series
of
snap
jerks
up
the
string
to
her
hand
again
oh
stop
it
richie
said
i
hate
showoffs
or
how
about
this
bev
asked
smiling
sweetly
she
got
the
yoyo
going
back
and
front
making
the
red
wooden
duncan
look
like
a
bolo
bouncer
richie
had
had
once
she
finished
with
two
around
the
worlds
almost
hitting
a
shuffling
old
lady
who
glared
at
them
the
yoyo
ended
up
in
her
cupped
palm
its
string
neatly
rolled
around
its
spindle
bev
handed
it
back
to
richie
and
sat
down
on
he
bench
again
richie
sat
down
next
to
her
his
jaw
hanging
agape
in
perfectly
unaffected
admiration
bev
looked
at
him
and
giggled
shut
your
mouth
you're
drawing
flies
richie
shut
his
mouth
with
a
snap
besides
that
last
part
was
just
luck
first
time
in
my
life
i
did
two
around
the
worlds
in
a
row
without
fizzing
out
kids
were
walking
past
them
now
on
their
way
to
the
show
peter
gordon
walked
by
with
marcia
fadden
they
were
supposed
to
be
going
together
but
richie
figured
it
was
just
that
they
lived
nest
door
to
each
other
on
west
broadway
and
were
such
a
couple
of
assholes
that
they
needed
each
other
support
and
attention
peter
gordon
was
already
getting
a
pretty
good
crop
of
acne
although
he
was
only
twelve
he
sometimes
hung
around
with
bowers
criss
and
huggins
but
he
wasn't
quite
brave
enough
to
try
anything
on
his
own
he
glanced
over
at
richie
and
bev
sitting
together
on
the
bench
and
chanted
richie
and
beverly
up
in
a
tree
kayeyeessesseyeengee
first
comes
love
then
comes
marriage
and
here
comes
richie
with
a
baby
carriage
marcia
finished
cawing
laughter
sit
on
this
dear
heart
bev
said
and
whipped
the
finger
on
them
marcia
looked
away
disgusted
as
if
she
could
not
believe
ayone
could
be
so
uncouth
gordon
slipped
an
arm
around
her
and
called
back
over
his
shoulder
to
richie
maybe
i'll
see
you
later
foureyes
maybe
you'll
see
your
mother
girdle
richie
responded
smartly
if
a
little
senselessly
beverly
collapsed
with
laughter
she
leaned
against
richie
shoulder
for
a
moment
and
richie
had
just
time
to
reflect
that
her
touch
and
the
sensation
of
her
lightly
carried
weight
was
not
exactly
unpleasant
then
she
sat
up
again
what
a
pair
of
jerks
she
said
yeah
i
think
marcia
fadden
pees
rosewater
richie
said
and
beverly
got
the
giggles
again
chanel
number
five
she
said
her
voice
muffled
because
her
hands
were
over
her
mouth
you
bet
said
richie
although
he
hadn't
the
slightest
idea
what
chanel
number
five
was
bev
what
can
you
show
me
how
to
make
it
sleep
i
guess
so
i
never
tried
to
show
anyone
how
did
you
learn
who
showed
you
she
gave
him
a
disgusted
look
no
one
showed
me
i
just
figured
it
out
like
twirling
a
baton
i'm
great
at
that
no
conceit
in
your
family
richie
said
rolling
his
eyes
well
i
a
she
said
but
i
didn't
take
classes
or
anything
you
really
can
twirl
sure
probably
be
a
cheerleader
in
junior
high
huh
she
smiled
it
was
a
kind
of
smile
richie
had
never
seen
before
it
was
wise
cynical
and
sad
all
at
the
same
time
he
recoiled
a
little
from
its
unknowing
power
as
he
had
recoiled
from
the
picture
of
downtown
in
georgie
album
when
it
had
begun
to
move
that
for
girls
like
marcia
fadde
she
said
her
and
sally
mueiler
and
greta
bowie
girls
who
pee
rosewater
their
fathers
help
to
buy
the
sports
equipment
and
the
uniforms
they
got
an
in
i'll
never
be
a
cheerleader
«
jeez
bev
that
no
attitude
to
take
sure
it
is
if
it
the
truth
she
shrugged
i
don't
care
who
wants
to
do
somersaults
and
show
your
underwear
to
a
million
people
anyway
look
richie
watch
this
for
the
next
ten
minutes
she
worked
on
showing
richie
how
to
make
his
yoyo
sleep
near
the
end
richie
actually
began
to
get
the
hang
of
it
although
he
could
usually
only
get
it
to
come
halfway
up
the
string
after
waking
it
up
you're
not
jerking
your
fingers
hard
enough
thats
al
she
said
richie
looked
at
the
clock
on
the
merrill
trust
across
the
street
and
jumped
up
stuffing
his
yoyo
into
his
back
pocket
jeepers
i
gotta
get
goin
bev
i'm
supposed
to
meet
ole
haystack
he'll
think
i
changed
my
mind
or

thin
who

calhoun
the
wrestler

frowned
at
him
that
not
very
nice
i
like
ben
doan
whup

massa
richie
screeched
in
his
pickaninny
voice
rolling
his
eyes
and
flapping
his
hands
doan
whup

i'se
gwineter
be
a
good
dahkie
ma'am
i'se
richie
bev
said
thinly
richie
quit
it
i
like
him
too
he
said
we
all
built
a
dam
down
in
the
barrens
a
couple
of
days
ago
and
you
go
down
there
you
and
ben
play
down
there
sure
a
bunch
of
us
guys
do
it
sorta
cool
down
there
richie
glanced
at
the
clock
again
i
really
gotta
split
for
the
scene
ben'll
be
waiting
okay
he
paused
thought
and
said
if
you're
not
doing
anything
come
on
with
me
i
told
you
i
don't
have
any
money
til
pay
your
way
i
got
a
couple
of
bucks
she
tossed
the
remains
of
her
icecream
cone
in
a
nearby
litter
barrel
her
eyes
that
fine
clear
shade
of
bluegray
turned
up
to
his
they
were
coolly
amused
she
pretended
to
primp
her
hair
and
asked
him
oh
dear
am
i
being
asked
out
on
a
date
for
a
moment
richie
was
uncharacteristically
flustered
he
actually
felt
a
blush
rising
in
his
cheeks
he
had
made
the
offer
in
a
perfectly
natural
way
just
as
he
had
made
it
to
ben
except
hadn't
he
said
something
to
ben
about
owesies
yes
but
he
hadn't
said
anything
about
owesies
to
beverly
richie
suddenly
felt
a
bit
weird
he
had
dropped
his
eyes
retreating
from
her
amused
glance
and
realized
now
that
her
skirt
had
ridden
up
a
bit
when
she
shifted
forward
to
drop
the
icecream
cone
in
the
litter
barrel
and
he
could
see
her
knees
he
raised
his
eyes
but
that
was
no
help
now
he
was
looking
at
the
beginning
swells
of
her
bosoms
richie
as
he
usually
did
in
such
moments
of
confusion
took
refuge
in
absurdity
yes
a
date
he
screamed
throwing
himself
on
his
knees
before
her
and
holding
his
clasped
hands
up
please
come
please
come
i
shall
ruddy
kil
meself
if
you
say
no
aywot
wotwo
oh
richie
you're
such
a
fuzzbrai
she
said
giggling
again
but
weren't
her
cheeks
also
a
trifle
flushed
if
so
it
made
her
look
prettier
than
ever
get
up
before
you
get
arrested
he
got
up
and
plopped
down
beside
her
again
he
felt
as
if
his
equilibrium
had
returned
a
little
foolishness
always
helped
when
you
had
a
dizzy
spell
he
believed
you
wanna
go
sure
she
said
thank
you
very
much
think
of
it
my
first
date
just
wait
until
i
write
it
in
my
diary
tonight
she
clasped
her
hands
together
between
her
budding
breasts
fluttered
her
eyelashes
rapidly
and
then
laughed
wish
you'd
stop
calling
it
that
richie
said
she
sighed
you
don't
have
much
romance
in
your
soul
damn
right
i
don't
but
he
felt
somehow
delighted
with
himself
the
world
seemed
suddenly
very
clear
to
him
and
very
friendly
he
found
himself
glancing
sideways
at
her
from
time
to
time
she
was
looking
in
the
shop
windows
at
the
dresses
and
nightgowns
in
cornellhopley
at
the
towels
and
pots
in
the
window
of
the
discount
barn
and
he
stole
glances
at
her
hair
the
line
of
her
jaw
he
observed
the
way
her
bare
arms
came
out
of
the
round
holes
of
her
blouse
he
saw
the
edge
of
her
slip
strap
all
of
these
things
delighted
him
he
could
not
have
said
why
but
what
had
happened
in
george
denbrough
bedroom
had
never
seemed
more
distant
to
him
than
it
did
right
then
it
was
time
to
go
time
to
meet
ben
but
he
would
sit
here
just
a
moment
longer
while
her
eyes
windowshopped
because
it
was
good
to
look
at
her
and
be
with
her
kids
were
ponying
up
their
quarter
admissions
at
the
aladdin
boxoffice
window
and
going
into
the
lobby
looking
through
the
bank
of
glass
doors
richie
could
£e
a
crowd
around
the
candy
counter
the
popcorn
machine
was
in
overdrive
spilling
out
drifts
of
the
stuff
its
greasy
hinged
lid
jittering
up
and
down
he
didn't
see
ben
anywhere
he
asked
beverly
if
she
had
spotted
him
she
shook
her
head
maybe
he
already
went
in
he
said
he
didn't
have
any
money
and
the
daughter
of
frankenstein
there
would
never
let
him
in
without
a
ticket
richie
cocked
a
thumb
at
mrs
cole
who
had
been
the
ticket
taker
at
the
aladdin
since
a
time
well
before
the
pictures
had
begun
to
talk
her
hair
dyed
a
bright
red
was
so
thin
you
could
see
her
scalp
beneath
she
had
enormous
hanging
lips
which
she
painted
with
plum
colored
lipstick
wild
blotches
of
rouge
covered
her
cheeks
her
eyebrows
were
drawn
on
in
black
pencil
mrs
cole
was
a
perfect
democrat
she
hated
all
kids
equally
boy
i
don't
wanna
go
in
without
him
but
the
show
gonna
start
richie
said
where
in
heck
is
he
you
can
buy
him
a
ticket
and
leave
it
at
the
boxoffice
bev
said
reasonably
enough
then
when
he
comes
but
just
then
ben
came
around
the
corner
of
center
and
macklin
streets
he
was
puffing
and
his
belly
joggled
beneath
his
sweatshirt
he
saw
richie
and
raised
one
hand
to
wave
then
he
saw
bev
and
his
hand
stopped
in
midflap
his
eyes
widened
momentarily
he
finished
his
wave
and
then
walked
slowly
to
where
they
stood
under
the
aladdin
marquee
hi
richie
he
said
and
then
looked
at
bev
briefly
it
was
as
if
he
was
afraid
that
an
overlong
look
might
result
in
a
flash
burn
hi
bev
hello
ben
she
said
and
a
strange
silence
fell
between
the
two
of
them
it
was
not
precisely
awkward
it
was
richie
thought
almost
powerful
and
he
felt
a
vague
twinge
of
jealousy
because
something
had
passed
between
them
and
whatever
it
had
been
he
had
been
excluded
from
it
howdy
haystack
he
said
thought
you
went
chicken
on
me
these
movies
goan
scare
ten
pounds
off
your
pudgy
body
ah
say
ah
say
they
goan
turn
your
hair
white
boy
when
you
come
out
of
this
theater
you
goan
need
an
usher
to
help
you
up
the
aisle
you
goan
be
shakin
so
bad
richie
started
for
the
boxoffice
and
ben
touched
his
arm
ben
started
to
speak
glanced
at
bev
who
was
smiling
at
him
and
had
to
start
over
again
i
was
here
he
said
but
i
went
up
the
street
and
around
the
corner
when
those
guys
came
along
what
guys
richie
asked
but
he
thought
he
already
knew
henry
bowers
victor
criss
belch
huggins
some
other
guys
too
richie
whistled
they
must
have
already
gone
inside
the
theater
i
don't
see
em
buying
candy
yeah
i
guess
so
if
i
was
them
i
wouldn't
bother
paying
to
see
a
couple
of
horror
movies
richie
said
td
just
stay
home
and
look
in
a
mirror
save
some
bread
bev
laughed
merrily
at
that
but
ben
only
smiled
a
little
henry
bowers
had
maybe
only
started
out
to
hurt
him
that
day
last
week
but
he
had
ended
up
meaning
to
kill
him
ben
was
quite
sure
of
that
tell
you
what
richie
said
we'll
go
up
in
the
balcony
they'll
dl
be
sittin
down
in
the
second
or
third
row
with
their
feet
up
you
positive
ben
asked
he
was
not
at
all
sure
richie
understood
what
bad
news
those
kids
were
henry
of
course
being
the
worst
news
of
all
richie
who
had
barely
escaped
what
might
have
been
a
really
bad
beating
at
the
hands
of
henry
and
his
spasmoid
friends
three
months
ago
he
had
managed
to
elude
them
in
the
toy
department
of
freese
department
store
of
all
places
understood
more
about
henry
and
his
merry
crew
than
ben
thought
he
did
if
i
wasn't
fairly
positive
i
wouldn't
go
i
he
said
i
want
to
see
those
movies
haystack
but
i
don't
want
to
like
die
for
em
besides
if
they
give
us
any
trouble
we'll
just
tell
foxy
to
kick
them
out
bev
said
foxy
was
mr
foxworth
the
thin
sallow
glumlooking
man
who
managed
the
aladdin
he
was
now
selling
candy
and
popcorn
chanting
his
litany
of
wait
your
turn
wait
your
turn
wait
your
turn
in
his
threadbare
tux
and
yellowing
boiled
shirt
he
looked
like
a
undertaker
who
had
fallen
on
hard
times
ben
looked
doubtfully
from
bev
to
foxy
to
richie
you
can't
let
em
run
your
life
man
richie
said
softly
don't
you
know
that
i
guess
so
ben
said
and
sighed
actually
he
knew
no
such
thing
but
beverly
being
here
had
given
the
equation
a
crazy
skew
if
she
hadn't
come
he
would
have
tried
to
persuade
richie
to
go
to
the
movies
another
day
and
if
richie
had
persisted
ben
might
have
bowed
out
but
bev
was
here
he
didn't
want
to
look
like
a
chicken
in
front
of
her
and
the
thought
of
being
with
her
in
the
balcony
in
the
dark
even
if
richie
was
between
them
as
he
probably
would
be
was
a
powerful
attraction
we'll
wait
until
the
show
starts
before
we
go
i
richie
said
he
grinned
and
punched
ben
on
the
arm
shit
haystack
you
wanna
live
forever
ben
brows
drew
together
and
then
he
snorted
laughter
richie
also
laughed
looking
at
them
beverly
laughed
too
richie
approached
the
ticket
booth
again
liver
lips
cole
looked
at
him
sourly
good
ahfternyoon
deah
lady
richie
said
in
his
best
baron
butthole
voice
i
am
in
diah
need
of
three
tickeytickies
to
youah
deah
old
american
flicktoons
cut
the
crap
and
tell
me
what
you
want
ki
liver
lips
barked
through
the
round
hole
cut
in
the
glass
and
something
about
the
way
her
painted
eyebrows
were
going
up
and
down
unsettled
richie
so
much
that
he
simply
pushed
a
rumpled
dollar
through
the
slot
and
muttered
three
please
three
tickets
popped
out
of
the
slot
richie
took
them
liver
lips
rammed
a
quarter
back
at
him
don't
be
smart
don't
throw
popcorn
boxes
don't
holler
don't
run
in
the
lobby
don't
run
in
the
aisles
no
ma’a
richie
said
backing
away
to
where
ben
and
bev
stood
he
said
to
them
it
always
warms
my
heart
to
see
an
old
fart
like
that
who
really
likes
kids
they
stood
outside
awhile
longer
waiting
for
the
show
to
start
liver
lips
glared
at
them
suspiciously
from
her
glass
cage
richie
regaled
bev
with
the
story
of
the
dam
in
the
barrens
trumpeting
mr
nell
lines
in
his
new
irish
cop
voice
beverly
was
giggling
before
long
laughing
hard
not
long
after
that
even
ben
was
grinning
a
little
although
his
eyes
kept
shifting
either
toward
the
aladdin
glass
doors
or
to
beverly
face
the
balcony
was
okay
during
the
first
reel
of
i
was
a
teenage
frankenstein
richie
spotted
henry
bowers
and
his
shitkicking
friends
they
were
down
in
the
second
row
just
as
he
had
figured
they
would
be
there
were
five
or
six
of
them
in
all
fifth
sixth
and
seventh
graders
all
of
them
with
their
motorhuckle
boots
cocked
up
on
the
seats
in
front
of
them
foxy
would
come
down
and
tell
them
to
put
their
feet
on
the
floor
they
would
foxy
would
leave
up
went
the
motorhuckle
boots
again
as
soon
as
he
did
five
or
ten
minutes
later
foxy
would
return
and
the
entire
charade
would
be
acted
out
again
foxy
didn't
quite
have
the
guts
to
kick
them
out
and
they
knew
it
the
movies
were
great
the
teenage
frankenstein
was
suitably
gross
the
teenage
werewolf
was
somehow
scarier
though
perhaps
because
he
also
seemed
a
little
sad
what
had
happened
wasn't
his
own
fault
there
was
this
hypnotist
who
had
fucked
him
up
but
the
only
reason
he'd
been
able
to
was
that
the
kid
who
turned
into
the
werewolf
was
full
of
anger
and
bad
feelings
richie
found
himself
wondering
if
there
were
many
people
in
the
world
hiding
bad
feelings
like
that
henry
bowers
was
just
overflowing
with
bad
feelings
but
he
sure
didn't
bother
hiding
them
beverly
sat
between
the
boys
ate
popcorn
from
their
boxes
screamed
covered
her
eyes
sometimes
laughed
when
the
werewolf
was
stalking
the
girl
doing
exercises
in
the
gym
after
school
she
pressed
her
face
against
ben
arm
and
richie
heard
ben
gasp
of
surprise
even
over
the
screams
of
the
two
hundred
kids
below
them
the
werewolf
was
finally
killed
in
the
last
scene
one
cop
solemnly
told
another
that
this
should
teach
people
not
to
fiddle
with
things
best
left
to
god
the
curtain
came
down
and
the
lights
came
up
there
was
applause
richie
felt
totally
satisfied
if
a
little
headachy
he'd
probably
have
to
go
to
the
eyedoctor
pretty
soon
and
get
his
lenses
changed
again
he
really
would
be
wearing
coke
bottles
on
his
eyes
by
the
time
he
got
to
high
school
he
thought
glumly
ben
twitched
at
his
sleeve
they
saw
us
richie
he
said
in
a
dry
dismayed
voice
huh
bowers
and
criss
they
looked
up
here
on
their
way
out
they
saw
us
okay
okay
richie
said
calm
down
haystack
just
caaalm
down
we'll
go
out
the
side
door
nothing
to
worry
about
they
went
down
the
stairs
richie
in
the
lead
beverly
in
the
middle
ben
bringing
up
the
rear
and
looking
back
over
his
shoulder
every
two
steps
or
so
have
those
guys
really
got
it
in
for
you
be
beverly
asked
yeah

guess

ben
said

in
a
fight
with
henry
bowers
on
the
last
day
of
school
did
he
beat
you
up
not
as
much
as
he
wanted
ben
said
that
why
he
still
mad
i
guess
ole
hank
the
tank
also
lost
a
fair
amount
of
skin
richie
murmured
or
so
i
heard
i
don't
think
he
was
very
pleased
about
that
either
he
pushed
open
the
exit
door
and
the
three
of
them
stepped
out
into
the
alley
that
ran
between
the
aladdin
and
nan
luncheonette
a
cat
which
had
been
rooting
in
a
garbage
can
hissed
and
ran
past
them
down
the
alley
which
was
blocked
at
the
far
end
by
a
board
fence
the
cat
scrambled
up
and
over
a
trashcan
lid
clattered
bev
jumped
grabbed
richie
arm
and
then
laughed
nervously
i
guess
i'm
still
scared
from
the
movies
she
said
you
won't
richie
began
hello
fuckface
henry
bowers
said
from
behind
them
startled
the
three
of
them
turned
around
henry
victor
and
belch
were
standing
at
the
mouth
of
the
alley
there
were
two
other
guys
behind
them
oh
shit
i
knew
this
was
going
to
happen
ben
moaned
richie
turned
quickly
back
toward
the
aladdin
but
the
exit
door
had
closed
behind
them
and
there
was
no
way
to
open
it
from
the
outside
say
goodbye
fuckface
henry
said
and
suddenly
ran
at
ben
the
things
that
happened
next
seemed
to
richie
both
then
and
later
like
something
out
of
a
movie
such
things
simply
did
not
happen
in
real
life
in
real
life
the
little
kids
took
their
beatings
picked
up
their
teeth
and
went
home
it
didn't
happen
that
way
this
time
beverly
stepped
forward
and
to
one
side
almost
as
if
she
intended
to
meet
henry
perhaps
shake
his
hand
richie
could
hear
the
cleats
on
his
boots
rapping
victor
and
belch
were
coming
after
him
the
other
two
boys
stood
at
the
mouth
of
the
alley
guarding
it
leave
him
alone
beverly
shouted
pick
on
someone
your
own
size
he
as
big
as
a
fucking
mack
truck
bitc
henry
no
gentleman
snarled
now
get
out
of
m
richie
stuck
out
his
foot
he
didn't
think
he
meant
to
his
foot
went
out
the
same
way
wisecracks
dangerous
to
his
health
sometimes
emerged
all
on
their
own
from
his
mouth
henry
ran
into
it
and
fell
forward
the
brick
surface
of
the
alley
was
slippery
with
spilled
garbage
from
the
overflowing
cans
on
the
luncheonette
side
henry
went
skidding
like
a
shuffleboard
weight
he
started
to
get
up
his
shirt
blotched
with
coffee
grounds
mud
and
bits
of
lettuce
oh
you
guys
are
gonna
die'he
screamed
until
this
moment
ben
had
been
terrified
now
something
in
him
snapped
he
let
out
a
roar
and
grabbed
one
of
the
garbage
cans
for
just
a
moment
holding
it
up
garbage
spilling
everywhere
he
really
did
look
like
haystack
calhoun
his
face
was
pale
and
furious
he
threw
the
garbage
can
it
struck
henry
in
the
small
of
the
back
and
knocked
him
flat
again
let
get
out
of
here
richie
screamed
they
ran
toward
the
mouth
of
the
alley
victor
criss
jumped
in
front
of
them
bellowing
ben
lowered
his
head
and
rammed
it
into
victor
middle
woo
victor
grunted
and
sat
down
belch
grabbed
a
handful
of
beverly
ponytail
and
whipped
her
smartly
against
the
aladdin
brick
wall
beverly
bounced
off
and
ran
down
the
aley
rubbing
her
arm
richie
ran
after
her
grabbing
a
garbagecan
lid
on
the
way
belch
huggins
swung
a
fist
almost
the
size
of
a
daisy
ham
at
him
richie
pistoned
out
the
galvanized
steel
lid
belch
fist
met
it
there
was
a
loud
bonnngg
a
sound
that
was
almost
mellow
richie
felt
the
shock
travel
all
the
way
up
his
arm
to
the
shoulder
belch
screamed
and
began
to
hop
up
and
down
holding
his
swelling
hand
yondah
lies
da
tent
of
my
fadda
richie
said
confidentially
doing
a
very
passable
tony
curtis
voice
and
then
ran
after
ben
and
beverly
one
of
the
boys
at
the
mouth
of
the
alley
had
caught
beverly
ben
was
tussling
with
him
the
other
boy
began
to
rabbitpunch
ben
in
the
small
of
the
back
richie
swung
his
foot
it
connected
with
the
rabbitpuncher
buttocks
the
boy
howled
with
pain
richie
grabbed
beverly
arm
in
one
hand
ben
in
the
other
run'he
shouted
the
boy
ben
had
been
tussling
with
let
go
of
beverly
and
looped
a
punch
at
richie
his
ear
exploded
with
momentary
pain
then
went
numb
and
became
very
warm
a
high
whistling
sound
began
to
whine
in
his
head
it
sounded
like
the
noise
you
were
supposed
to
listen
for
when
the
school
nurse
put
the
earphones
on
you
to
test
your
hearing
they
ran
down
center
street
people
turned
to
look
at
them
ben
large
stomach
pogoed
up
and
down
beverly
ponytail
bounced
richie
let
go
of
ben
and
held
his
glasses
against
his
forehead
with
his
left
thumb
so
he
wouldn't
lose
them
his
head
was
still
ringing
and
he
believed
his
ear
was
going
to
swell
but
he
felt
wonderful
he
started
laughing
beverly
joined
him
soon
ben
was
laughing
too
they
cut
up
court
street
and
collapsed
on
a
bench
in
front
of
the
police
station
at
that
moment
it
seemed
the
only
place
in
derry
where
they
might
possibly
be
safe
beverly
looped
an
arm
around
ben
neck
and
richie
she
gave
them
a
furious
hug
that
was
grea
her
eyes
sparkled
did
you
see
those
guys
did
you
see
them
i
saw
them
all
right
ben
gasped
and
i
never
want
to
see
them
again
this
sent
them
off
into
another
storm
of
hysterical
laughter
richie
kept
expecting
henry
gang
to
come
around
the
corner
onto
court
street
and
take
after
them
again
police
station
or
not
still
he
could
not
stop
laughing
beverly
was
right
it
had
been
great
the
losers
club
gets
off
a
good
one
richie
yelled
exuberantly
wackawacka
wacka
he
cupped
his
hands
around
his
mouth
and
put
on
his
ben
bernie
voice
yowza
yowza
yowza
childrens
a
cop
poked
his
head
out
ď
an
open
secondfloor
window
and
shouted
you
kids
get
out
of
here
right
now
take
a
walk
richie
opened
his
mouth
to
say
something
brilliant
quite
possibly
in
his
brandnew
irish
cop
voice
and
ben
kicked
his
foot
shut
up
richie
he
said
and
promptly
had
trouble
believing
that
he
had
said
such
a
thing
right
richie
bev
said
looking
at
him
fondly
beepbeep
okay
richie
said
what
do
you
guys
want
to
do
wanna
go
find
henry
bowers
and
ask
him
if
he
wants
to
work
it
out
over
a
game
of
monopoly
bite
your
tongue
bev
said
huh
what
does
that
mean
never
mind
bev
said
some
guys
are
so
ignorant
hesitantly
blushing
furiously
ben
asked
did
that
guy
hurt
your
hair
beverly
she
smiled
at
him
gently
and
in
that
moment
she
became
sure
of
something
she
had
only
guessed
at
before
that
it
had
been
ben
hanscom
who
had
sent
her
the
postcard
with
the
beautiful
little
haiku
on
it
no
it
wasn't
ba
she
said
let
go
down
in
the
barrens
richie
proposed
and
so
that
was
where
they
went
or
where
they
escaped
richie
would
think
later
that
it
set
a
pattern
for
the
rest
of
the
summer
the
barrens
had
become
their
place
beverly
like
ben
on
the
day
of
his
first
encounter
with
the
big
boys
had
never
been
down
there
before
she
walked
between
richie
and
ben
as
the
three
of
them
moved
singlefile
down
the
path
her
skirt
twitched
prettily
and
looking
at
her
ben
was
aware
of
waves
of
feeling
as
powerful
as
stomach
cramps
she
was
wearing
her
ankle
bracelet
it
flashed
in
the
afternoon
sun
they
crossed
the
arm
of
the
kenduskeag
the
boys
had
dammed
up
the
stream
divided
about
seventy
yards
farther
up
along
its
course
and
became
one
again
about
two
hundred
yards
farther
on
toward
town
using
steppingstones
downstream
of
the
place
where
the
dam
had
been
found
another
path
and
eventually
came
out
on
the
bank
of
the
stream
eastern
fork
which
was
much
wider
than
the
other
it
sparkled
in
the
afternoon
light
to
his
left
ben
could
see
two
of
those
concrete
cylinders
with
the
manhole
covers
on
top
below
them
jutting
out
over
the
stream
were
large
concrete
pipes
thin
streams
of
muddy
water
poured
over
the
lips
of
these
outflow
pipes
and
into
the
kenduskeag
someone
takes
a
crap
uptown
and
here
where
it
comes
out
ben
thought
remembering
mr
nell
explanation
of
derry
drainage
system
he
felt
a
dull
sort
of
helpless
anger
once
there
had
probably
been
fish
in
this
river
now
your
chances
of
catching
a
trout
wouldn't
be
so
hot
your
chances
of
catching
a
used
wad
of
toilet
paper
would
be
better
tt
so
beautiful
here
bev
sighed
yeah
not
bad
richie
agreed
the
blackflies
are
gone
and
there
enough
of
a
breeze
to
keep
the
mosquitoes
away
he
looked
at
her
hopefully
got
any
cigarettes
n
she
said
i
had
a
couple
but
i
smoked
them
yesterday
too
bad
richie
said
there
was
the
blast
of
an
airhorn
and
they
all
watched
as
a
long
freight
rumbled
across
the
embankment
on
the
far
side
of
the
barrens
and
toward
the
trainyards
jeez
if
it
was
a
passenger
train
they'd
have
a
great
view
richie
thought
first
the
poorfolk
houses
of
the
old
cape
then
the
bamboo
swamps
on
the
other
side
of
the
kenduskeag
and
finally
before
leaving
the
barrens
the
smoldering
gravel
pit
that
was
the
town
dump
for
just
a
moment
he
found
himself
thinking
about
eddie
story
again
the
leper
under
the
abandoned
house
on
neibolt
street
he
pushed
it
out
of
his
mind
and
turned
to
ben
so
what
was
your
best
part
haystack
huh
ben
turned
to
him
guiltily
as
bev
looked
out
across
the
kenduskeag
lost
in
thoughts
of
her
own
he
had
been
looking
at
her
profile
and
at
the
bruise
on
her
cheekbone
of
the
movies
dumbo
what
was
your
best
part
i
liked
it
when
dr
frankenstein
started
tossing
the
bodies
to
the
crocodiles
under
his
hous
ben
said
that
was
my
best
part
that
was
gross
beverly
said
and
shivered
i
hate
things
like
that
crocodiles
and
piranhas
and
sharks
yeah
what
piranhas
richie
asked
immediately
interested
little
tiny
fish
beverly
said
and
they've
got
all
these
little
tiny
teeth
but
they're
wicked
sharp
and
if
you
go
into
a
river
where
they
are
they
eat
you
right
down
to
the
bone
wo
i
saw
this
movie
once
and
these
natives
wanted
to
cross
a
river
but
the
footbridge
was
down
she
said
so
they
put
a
cow
in
the
water
on
a
rope
and
crossed
while
the
piranhas
were
eating
the
cow
when
they
pulled
it
out
the
cow
was
nothing
but
a
skeleton
i
had
nightmares
for
a
week
man
i
wish
i
had
some
of
those
fish
richie
said
happily
td
put
em
in
henry
bower
bathtub
ben
began
to
giggle
i
don't
think
he
takes
baths
don't
know
about
that
but
i
do
know
we
better
watch
out
for
those
guys
beverly
said
her
ringers
touched
the
bruise
on
her
cheek
my
dad
went
up
the
side
of
my
head
day
before
yesterday
for
breaking
a
pile
of
dishes
one
a
week
is
enough
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
that
might
have
been
awkward
but
was
not
richie
broke
it
by
saying
his
best
part
was
when
the
teenage
werewolf
got
the
evil
hypnotist
they
talked
about
the
movies
and
other
horror
movies
they
had
seen
and
alfred
hitchcock
presents
on
tv
for
an
hour
or
more
bev
spotted
daises
growing
on
the
riverbank
and
picked
one
she
held
it
first
under
richie
chin
and
then
under
ben
chin
to
see
if
they
liked
butter
she
said
they
both
did
as
she
held
the
flower
under
their
chins
each
was
conscious
of
her
light
touch
on
their
shoulders
and
the
clean
scent
of
her
hair
her
face
was
close
to
ben
only
for
a
moment
or
two
but
that
night
he
dreamed
of
how
her
eyes
had
looked
during
that
brief
endless
span
of
time
conversation
was
fading
a
little
when
they
heard
the
crackling
sounds
of
people
approaching
along
the
path
the
three
of
them
turned
quickly
toward
the
sound
and
richie
was
suddenly
acutely
aware
that
the
river
was
at
their
backs
there
was
no
place
to
run
the
voices
drew
closer
they
got
to
their
feet
richie
and
ben
moving
a
little
in
front
of
beverly
without
even
thinking
about
it
the
screen
of
bushes
at
the
end
of
the
path
shook
and
suddenly
bill
denbrough
emerged
another
kid
was
with
him
a
fellow
richie
knew
a
little
bit
his
name
was
bradley
something
and
he
had
a
terrible
lisp
probably
went
up
to
bangor
with
bill
for
that
speech
therapy
thing
richie
thought
big
bill
he
said
and
then
in
the
voice
of
toodles
we
are
glad
to
see
you
mr
denbrough
mawster
bill
looked
at
them
and
grinned
and
a
peculiar
certainty
stole
over
richie
as
bill
looked
from
him
to
ben
to
beverly
and
then
back
to
bradley
whateverhisname
was
beverly
was
a
part
of
them
bill
eyes
said
so
bradley
what'shisname
was
not
he
might
stay
for
awhile
today
might
even
come
down
to
the
barrens
again
no
one
would
tell
him
no
so
sorry
the
loser
club
membership
is
full
we
already
have
our
speechimpediment
member
but
he
was
not
part
of
it
he
was
not
part
of
them
this
thought
led
to
a
sudden
irrational
fear
for
a
moment
he
felt
the
way
you
did
when
you
suddenly
realized
you
had
swum
out
too
far
and
the
water
was
over
your
head
there
was
an
intuitive
flash
we're
being
drawn
into
something
being
picked
and
chosen
none
of
this
is
accidental
are
we
all
here
yet
then
the
intuition
fell
into
a
meaningless
jumble
of
thought
like
the
smash
of
a
glass
pane
on
a
stone
floor
besides
it
didn't
matter
bill
was
here
and
bill
would
take
care
bill
would
not
let
things
get
out
of
control
he
was
the
tallest
of
them
and
surely
the
most
handsome
richie
only
had
to
look
sideways
at
bev
eyes
fixed
on
bill
and
then
farther
to
ben
eyes
fixed
knowingly
and
unhappily
on
bev
face
to
know
that
bill
was
also
the
strongest
of
them
and
not
just
physically
there
was
a
good
deal
more
to
it
than
that
but
since
richie
did
not
know
either
the
word
charisma
or
the
full
meaning
of
the
word
magnetism
he
only
felt
that
bill
strength
ran
deep
and
might
manifest
itself
in
many
ways
some
of
them
probably
unexpected
and
richie
suspected
if
beverly
fell
for
him
or
got
a
crush
on
him
or
whatever
they
called
it
ben
would
not
be
jealous
like
he
would
richie
thought
if
she
got
a
crush
on
me
he
would
accept
it
as
nothing
but
natural
and
there
was
something
else
bill
was
good
it
was
stupid
to
think
such
a
thing
he
did
not
in
fact
precisely
think
it
he
felt
it
but
there
it
was
goodness
and
strength
seemed
to
radiate
from
bill
he
was
like
a
knight
in
an
old
movie
a
movie
that
was
corny
but
still
had
the
power
to
make
you
cry
and
cheer
and
clap
at
the
end
strong
and
good
and
five
years
later
after
his
memories
of
what
had
happened
in
derry
both
during
and
before
that
summer
had
begun
to
fade
rapidly
it
occurred
to
a
richie
tozier
in
his
midteens
that
john
kennedy
reminded
him
of
stuttering
bill
who
his
mind
would
respond
he
would
look
up
faintly
puzzled
and
shake
his
head
some
guy
i
used
to
know
he
would
think
and
would
dismiss
vague
unease
by
pushing
his
glasses
up
on
his
nose
and
turning
to
his
homework
again
some
guy
i
used
to
know
a
long
time
ago
bill
denbrough
put
his
hands
on
his
hips
smiled
sunnily
and
said
wuhwuh
well
hhere
we
aaare
now
wuh
wub
wub
what
are
wwe
dddoing
got
any
cigarettes
richie
asked
hopefully
five
days
later
as
june
drew
toward
its
end
bill
told
richie
that
he
wanted
to
go
down
to
neibolt
street
and
investigate
under
the
porch
where
eddie
had
seen
the
leper
they
had
just
arrived
back
at
richie
house
and
bii
was
walking
silver
he
had
ridden
richie
double
most
of
the
way
home
an
exhilarating
speedtrip
across
derry
but
he
had
been
careful
to
let
richie
dismount
a
block
away
from
his
house
if
richie
mother
saw
bill
riding
richie
double
she'd
have
a
bird
silver
wire
basket
was
full
of
play
sixshooters
two
of
them
bill
three
of
them
richie
they
had
been
down
in
the
barrens
for
most
of
the
afternoon
playing
guns
beverly
marsh
had
shown
up
around
three
o'clock
wearing
faded
jeans
and
toting
a
very
old
daisy
air
rifle
that
had
lost
most
of
its
pop
when
you
pulled
its
tape
wrapped
trigger
it
uttered
a
wheeze
that
sounded
to
richie
more
like
someone
sitting
on
a
very
old
whoopee
cushion
than
a
rifleshot
her
specialty
was
japanesesniper
she
was
very
good
at
climbing
trees
and
shooting
the
unwary
as
they
passed
below
the
bruise
on
her
cheekbone
had
faded
to
a
faint
yellow
what
did
you
say
richie
asked
he
was
shocked
but
also
a
little
intrigued
i
wwwant
to
take
a
hook
under
that
puhpuhporch
bill
said
his
voice
was
stubborn
but
he
wouldn't
look
at
richie
there
was
a
hard
spot
of
flush
high
on
each
of
his
cheekbones
they
had
arrived
in
front
of
richie
house
maggie
tozier
was
on
the
porch
reading
a
book
she
waved
to
them
and
called
hi
boys
want
some
iced
tea
we'll
be
right
there
mom
richie
said
and
then
to
bill
there
isn't
going
to
be
anything
there
he
probably
just
saw
a
hobo
and
got
all
bent
out
of
shape
for
god
sake
you
know
eddie
yyeah
i
nunknow
eeeddie
bbut
ruhrememmember
the
pipipicture
in
the
a
album
richie
shifted
his
feet
uncomfortable
bill
raised
his
right
hand
the
bandaids
were
gone
now
but
richie
could
see
circlets
of
healing
scab
on
bill
first
three
fingers
yeah
but
luhlubhisten
to
mem
bill
said
he
began
to
speak
very
slowly
holding
richie
eyes
with
his
own
once
more
he
related
the
similarities
between
ben
story
and
eddie
and
tied
those
to
what
they
had
seen
n
the
picture
that
moved
he
suggested
again
that
the
clown
had
murdered
the
boys
and
girls
who
had
been
found
dead
in
berry
since
the
previous
december
aand
muhmuhhaybe

richie
said

said
thoughtfully

bill
nodded
whatdo
you
want
then
its
autograph
if

cluhcluhcluhhown

ooothers
then

his

richie
they
were
like
slate
hard
uncompromising
unforgiving
i
wwant
to
kkkill
it
jesus

richie
said
frightened
how

muhmy
ddad

a
pihpihpistol
bill
said
a
little
spittle
flew
from
his
lips
but
richie
barely
noticed
hhe
doesn't
nuhknow
i

but
i
dddo
it
on
the
top
sh
shelf
in
his
cluhcluhhoset
that

a
pile
of
kid
bones
i
poured

tea
boys
richie
mom
called
cheerily
better
come
and
get
it
right
there
mom
richie
called
again
offering
a
big
false
smile
it
disappeared
immediately
as
he
turned
back
to
bill
because
i
wouldn't
shoot
a
guy
just
because
he
was
wearing
a
clown
suit
billy
you're
my
best
friend
but
i
wouldn't
do
it
and
i
wouldn't
let
you
do
it
if
i
could
stop
you
wh
what
tif
there
rreally
wwas
a
ppile
of
bub
buh
bones
richie
licked
his
lips
and
said
nothing
for
a
moment
then
he
asked
bill
what
are
you
going
to
do
if
it
not
a
man
billy
what
if
it
really
is
some
kind
of
monster
what
f
there
really
are
such
things
ben
hanscom
said
it
was
the
mummy
and
the
balloons
were
floating
against
the
wind
and
it
didn't
cast
a
shadow
the
picture
in
georgie
album
either
we
imagined
that
or
it
was
magic
and
i
gotta
tell
you
man
i
don't
think
we
just
imagined
it
your
fingers
sure
didn't
imagine
it
did
they
bill
shook
his
head
so
what
are
we
going
to
do
if
it
not
a
man
billy
th
then
wuhwuhwe'll
have
to
£
figure
suhhomething
eelse
out
oh
yeah
richie
said
i
can
see
it
after
you
shoot
it
four
or
five
times
and
it
keeps
comin
at
us
like
the
teenage
werewolf
in
that
movie
me
and
ben
and
bev
saw
you
can
try
your
bullseye
on
it
and
if
the
bullseye
doesn't
work
i'll
throw
some
of
my
sneezing
powder
at
it
and
if
it
keeps
on
coming
after
that
we'll
just
call
time
and
say
hey
now
hold
on
this
ain't
getting
it
mr
monster
look
i
got
to
read
up
on
it
at
the
library
i'll
be
back
pawdon
me
is
that
what
you're
going
to
say
big
bill
he
looked
at
his
friend
his
head
thudding
rapidly
part
of
him
wanted
bill
to
press
on
with
his
idea
to
check
under
the
porch
of
that
old
house
but
another
part
wanted
desperately
wanted
bill
to
give
the
idea
up
in
some
ways
all
of
this
was
like
having
stepped
into
one
of
those
saturdayafternoon
horror
movies
at
the
aladdin
but
in
another
way
a
crucial
way
it
wasn't
like
that
at
all
because
this
wasn't
safe
like
a
movie
where
you
knew
everything
would
turn
out
all
right
and
even
if
it
didn't
it
was
no
skin
off
your
ass
the
picture
in
georgie
room
hadn't
been
like
a
movie
he
had
thought
he
was
forgetting
that
but
apparently
he
had
been
fooling
himself
because
now
he
could
see
those
cuts
whirling
up
billy
fingers
if
he
hadn't
pulled
bill
back
incredibly
bill
was
grinning
actually
grinning
yyyou
wuhwanted
m
me
to
take
y
you
to
luhluhlook
at
a
ppicture
he
said
nnow
i
wwant
to
ttake
you
to
hook
at
a
k
house
tit
for
ttat
you
got
no
tits
richie
said
and
they
both
burst
out
laughing
ttomorrow
muhmuhmorning
bill
said
as
if
it
had
been
resolved
and
if
it
a
monster
richie
asked
holding
bill
eyes
if
your
dad
gun
doesn't
stop
it
big
bill
if
it
just
keeps
coming
wuhwuhwe'll
thub
thub
think
of
suhhomething
else
bill
said
again
we'll
hhhave
to
he
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
like
a
loon
after
a
moment
richie
joined
him
it
was
impossible
not
to
they
walked
up
the
crazypaving
to
richie
porch
together
maggie
had
set
out
huge
glasses
of
iced
tea
with
mint
sprigs
in
them
and
a
plate
of
vanilla
wafers
yuhyou
w
w
want
tt
well
no
richie
said
but
i
will
bill
clapped
him
on
the
back
hard
and
that
seemed
to
make
the
fear
bearable
although
richie
was
suddenly
sure
and
he
was
not
wrong
that
sleep
would
be
long
coming
that
night
you
boys
looked
like
you
were
having
a
serious
discussion
out
there
mrs
tozier
said
sitting
down
with
her
book
in
one
hand
and
a
glass
of
iced
tea
in
the
other
she
boked
at
the
boys
expectantly
aw
denbrough
got
this
crazy
idea
the
red
sox
are
going
to
finish
in
the
first
division
richie
said
mme
and
my
dddddad
ththink
tthey
got
a
shshot
at
tthird
bill
said
and
slipped
his
iced
tea
tthis
is
vehvehvery
go
good
muhmrs
tozier
thank
you
bill
the
year
the
sox
finish
in
the
first
division
will
be
the
year
you
stop
stuttering
mush
mouth
richie
said
richie
mrs
tozier
screamed
shocked
she
nearly
dropped
her
glass
of
iced
tea
but
both
richie
and
bill
denbrough
were
laughing
hysterically
totally
cracked
up
she
looked
from
her
son
to
bill
and
back
to
her
son
again
touched
by
wonder
that
was
mostly
simple
perplexity
but
partly
a
fear
so
thin
and
sharp
that
it
found
its
way
deep
into
her
inner
heart
and
vibrated
there
like
a
tuning
fork
made
of
clear
ice
i
don't
understand
either
of
them
she
thought
where
they
go
what
they
do
what
they
want
or
what
will
become
of
them
sometimes
oh
sometimes
their
eyes
are
wild
and
sometimes
i'm
afraid
for
them
and
sometimes
i'm
afraid
of
them
she
found
herself
thinking
not
for
the
first
time
that
it
would
have
been
nice
if
she
and
went
could
have
had
a
girl
as
well
a
pretty
blonde
girl
that
she
could
have
dressed
in
skirts
and
matching
bows
and
black
patentleather
shoes
on
sundays
a
pretty
little
girl
who
would
ask
to
bake
cupcakes
after
school
and
who
would
want
dolls
instead
of
books
on
ventriloquism
and
revell
models
of
cars
that
went
fast
a
pretty
little
girl
she
could
have
understood
did
you
get
it
richie
asked
anxiously
they
were
walking
their
bikes
up
kansas
street
beside
the
barrens
at
ten
o'clock
the
next
moming
the
sky
was
a
dull
gray
rain
had
been
forecast
for
that
afternoon
richie
hadn't
gotten
to
sleep
until
after
midnight
and
he
thought
denbrough
looked
as
if
he
had
spent
a
fairly
restless
night
himself
ole
big
bill
was
toting
a
matched
set
of
samsonite
bags
one
under
each
eye
i
g
got
it
bill
said
he
patted
the
green
duffel
coat
he
was
wearing
lemme
see
richie
said
fascinated
not
now
bill
said
and
then
grinned
someone
ehehelse
might
see
too
but
/llook
what
else
i
bruhbrought
he
reached
behind
him
under
the
coat
and
brought
his
bullseye
slingshot
out
of
his
back
pocket
oh
shit
we're
in
trouble
richie
said
beginning
to
laugh
bill
pretended
to
be
hurt
ih
ibit
was
y
your
idea
tttozier
bill
had
gotten
the
custom
aluminum
slingshot
for
his
birthday
the
year
before
it
had
been
zack
compromise
between
the
bill
had
wanted
and
his
mother
adamant
refusal
to
even
consider
giving
a
boy
bill
age
a
firearm
the
instruction
booklet
said
a
slingshot
could
be
a
fine
hunting
weapon
once
you
learned
to
use
it
in
the
right
hands
your
bullseye
slingshot
is
as
deadly
and
effective
as
a
good
ash
bow
or
a
highpowered
firearm
the
booklet
proclaimed
with
such
virtues
dutifully
extolled
the
booklet
went
on
to
warn
that
a
slingshot
could
be
dangerous
the
owner
should
no
more
aim
one
of
the
twenty
ballbearing
slugs
which
came
with
it
at
a
person
than
he
would
aim
a
loaded
pistol
at
a
person
bill
wasn't
very
good
at
it
yet
and
guessed
privately
he
probably
never
would
be
but
he
thought
the
booklet
caution
was
merited
the
slingshot
thick
elastic
had
a
hard
pull
and
when
you
hit
a
tin
can
with
it
it
made
one
hell
of
a
hole
you
doin
any
better
with
it
big
bill
richie
asked
a
lublublittle
bill
said
this
was
only
partly
true
after
much
study
of
the
pictures
in
the
booklet
which
were
labelled
figs
as
in
fig
fig
and
so
on
and
enough
practice
in
derry
park
to
lame
his
arm
he
had
gotten
so
he
could
hit
the
paper
target
which
had
also
come
with
the
slingshot
maybe
three
times
out
of
every
ten
tries
and
once
he
had
gotten
a
bullseye
almost
richie
pulled
the
sling
back
by
the
cup
twanged
it
then
handed
it
back
he
said
nothing
but
privately
doubted
if
it
would
count
for
as
much
as
zack
denbrough
pistol
when
it
came
to
killing
monsters
yea
he
said
you
brought
your
slingshot
okay
big
deal
that
nothing
look
what
i
brought
denbrough
and
from
his
own
jacket
he
hauled
out
a
packet
with
a
cartoon
picture
on
it
of
a
bald
man
saying
ahchoo
as
his
cheeks
puffed
œt
like
dizzy
gillespie
dr
wacky
s
sneezing
powder
the
packet
said
it
a
laff
riot
the
two
of
them
stared
at
each
other
for
a
long
moment
and
then
broke
up
screaming
with
laughter
and
pounding
each
other
on
the
back
wwwe're
pruhprepared
for
aaanything
bill
said
finally
still
giggling
and
wiping
his
eyes
with
the
sleeve
of
his
jacket
your
face
and
my
ass
stuttering
bill
richie
said
i
thththought
it
wuhwas
the
uhuhother
way
aaroun
bill
said
now

richie
nodded
feeling
no
urge
to
argue
his
twentytwoinch
raleigh
he
sometimes
whammed
his
kneecaps
on
the
handlebars
when
he
was
pedaling
fast
looked
like
a
pygmy
bike
next
to
the
scrawny
gantry
like
edifice
that
was
silver
he
knew
that
bill
was
stronger
and
silver
was
faster
they
got
to
the
little
bridge
and
bill
helped
richie
stow
his
bike
underneath
then
they
sat
down
and
with
the
occasional
rumble
of
traffic
passing
over
their
heads
bill
unzipped
his
duffel
and
took
out
his
father
pistol
yyou
be
goddam
cccarefu
bill
said
handing
it
over
after
richie
had
whistled
his
frank
approval
th
there
nno
sssafety
on
a
pih
pihstol
like
that
ts
it
loaded
richie
asked
awed
the
pistol
an
sspkwalther
that
zack
denbrough
had
picked

his
face
uttered
a
strange
smile
which
said
that
while
he
didn't
believe
anything
so
silly
he
believed
it
completely
richie
understood
there
was
a
caged
deadliness
in
the
thing
that
he
had
never
sensed
in
his
dad

or
even
the
shotgun
although
there
was
something
about
the
shotgun
wasn't
there
something
about
the
way
it
leaned
mute
and
oily
in
the
corner
of
the
garage
closet
as
if
it
might
say
j
could
be
mean
if
i
wanted
to
plenty
mean
you
bet
if
it
could
speak
but
this
pistol
this
walther
it
was
as
if
it
had
been
made
for
the
express
purpose
of
shooting
people
with
a
chill
richie
realized
that
was
why
it
had
been
made
what
else
could
you
do
with
a
pistol
use
it
to
light
your
cigarettes
he
turned
the
muzzle
toward
him
being
careful
to
keep
his
hands
far
away
from
the
trigger
one
look
into
the
walthers
black
lidless
eye
made
him
understand
bill
peculiar
smile
perfectly
he
remembered
his
father
saying
if
you
remember
there
is
no
such
thing
as
an
unloaded
gun
you'll
be
okay
with
firearms
all
your
life
richie
he
handed
the
gun
back
to
bill
glad
to
be
rid
of
it
bill
stowed
it
in
his
duffel
coat
again
suddenly
the
house
on
neibolt
street
seemed
less
frightening
to
richie
but
the
possibility
that
blood
might
actually
be
spilled
that
seemed
much
stronger
he
looked
at
bill
perhaps
meaning
to
appeal
this
idea
again
but
he
saw
bill
face
read
it
and
only
said
you
ready
as
always
when
bill
finally
pulled
his
second
foot
up
from
the
ground
richie
felt
sure
that
they
would
crash
splitting
their
silly
skulls
on
unyielding
cement
the
big
bike
wavered
crazily
from
side
to
side
the
cards
clothespinned
to
the
fenderstruts
stopped
firing
single
shots
and
started
machinegunning
the
bike
drunken
wavers
became
more
pronounced
richie
closed
his
eyes
and
waited
for
the
inevitable
then
bill
bellowed
hiyo
silver
awwayyyyy
the
bike
picked
up
more
speed
and
finally
stopped
that
seasick
sidetoside
wavering
richie
loosened
his
deathgrip
on
bill
middle
and
held
the
front
of
the
package
carrier
over
the
rear
wheel
instead
bill
crossed
kansas
street
on
a
slant
raced
down
sidestreets
at
an
everquickening
pace
heading
for
witcham
as
if
racing
down
a
set
of
geographical
steps
they
came
bulleting
out
of
strapham
street
and
onto
witcham
at
an
exorbitant
rate
of
speed
bill
laid
silver
damn
near
over
on
his
side
and
bellowed
hiyo
silver
again
ride
it
big
bill
richie
screamed
so
scared
he
was
nearly
creaming
his
jeans
but
laughing
wildly
all
the
same
stand
on
this
baby
bill
suited
the
action
to
the
word
getting
up
and
leaning
over
the
handlebars
and
pumping
the
pedals
at
a
lunatic
rate
looking
at
bill
back
which
was
amazingly
broad
for
a
boy
of
eleven
goingontwelve
watching
it
work
under
the
duffel
coat
the
shoulders
slanting
first
one
way
and
then
the
other
as
he
shifted
his
weight
from
one
pedal
to
the
other
richie
suddenly
became
sure
that
they
were
invulnerable
they
would
live
forever
and
ever
well
perhaps
not
they
but
bill
would
bill
had
no
idea
of
how
strong
he
was
how
somehow
sure
and
perfect
they
sped
along
the
houses
thinning
out
a
little
now
the
streets
crossing
witcham
at
longer
intervals
hiyo
silver
bill
yelled
and
richie
hollered
in
his
nigger
jim
voice
high
and
shrill
hi
yo
silvuh
massa
thass
rant
you
is
rahdin
disyere

fo

lawksamussy
hiyo
silvuh
awwayyy
now
they
were
passing
green
fields
that
looked
flat
and
depthless
under
the
gray
sky
richie
could
see
the
old
brick
train
station
up
ahead
in
the
distance
to
the
right
of
it
quonset
warehouses
marched
off
in
a
row
silver
bumped
over
one
set
of
train
tracks
then
another
and
here
was
neibolt
street
atting
off
to
the
right
derry
trainyards
a
blue
sign
under
the
street
sign
read
it
was
rusty
and
hung
askew
below
this
was
a
much
bigger
sign
yellow
field
black
letters
it
was
almost
like
a
comment
on
the
trainyards
themselves
dead
end
it
read
bill
turned
onto
neibolt
street
coasted
to
the
sidewalk
and
put
his
foot
back
down
let
wwwalk
from
here
richie
slipped
off
the
package
carrier
with
mingled
feelings
of
relief
and
regret
okay
they
walked
along
the
sidewalk
which
was
cracked
and
weedy
up
ahead
of
them
in
the
trainyards
a
diesel
engine
revved
slowly
up
faded
off
and
then
began
all
over
again
once
or
twice
they
heard
the
metallic
music
of
couplings
being
smashed
together
you
scared
richie
asked
bill
bill
walking
silver
by
the
handlebars
looked
over
at
richie
briefly
and
then
nodded
y
yeah
you
sure
am
richie
said
bill
told
richie
he
had
asked
his
father
about
neibolt
street
the
night
before
his
father
said
that
a
lot
of
trainmen
had
lived
out
this
way
until
the
end
of
world
war
i
engineers
conductors
signalmen
yardworkers
baggage
handlers
the
street
had
declined
with
the
trainyards
and
as
bill
and
richie
moved
farther
along
it
the
houses
became
farther
apart
seedier
dirtier
the
last
three
or
four
on
both
sides
were
empty
and
boarded
up
their
yards
overgrown
a
for
sale
sign
flapped
forlomly
from
the
porch
of
one
to
richie
the
sign
looked
about
a
thousand
years
old
the
sidewalk
stopped
and
now
they
were
walking
along
a
beaten
track
from
which
weeds
grew
half
heartedly
bill
stopped
and
pointed
ththere
it
iiis
he
said
softly
twentynine
neibolt
street
had
once
been
a
trim
red
cape
cod
maybe
.richie
thought
an
engineer
used
to
live
there
a
bachelor
with
no
pants
but
jeans
and
lots
of
those
gloves
with
the
big
stiff
cuffs
and
four
or
five
pillowtick
caps
a
fellow
who
would
come
home
once
or
twice
a
month
for
stretches
of
three
or
four
days
and
listen
to
the
radio
while
he
pottered
in
the
garden
a
fellow
who
would
eat
mostly
fried
foods
and
no
vegetables
although
he
would
grow
them
for
his
friends
and
who
would
on
windy
nights
think
about
the
girl
he
left
behind
now
the
red
paint
had
faded
to
a
wishywashy
pink
that
was
peeling
away
in
ugly
patches
that
looked
like
sores
the
windows
were
blind
eyes
boarded
up
most
of
the
shingles
were
gone
weeds
grew
rankly
down
both
sides
of
the
house
and
the
lawn
was
covered
with
the
season
first
bumper
crop
of
dandelions
to
the
left
a
high
board
fence
perhaps
once
a
neat
white
but
now
faded
to
a
dull
gray
that
almost
matched
the
lowering
sky
lurched
drunkenly
in
and
out
of
the
dank
shrubbery
about
halfway
down
this
fence
richie
could
see
a
monstrous
grove
of
sunflowers
the
tallest
looked
five
fet
tall
or
more
they
had
a
bloated
nasty
look
he
didn't
like
a
breeze
rustled
them
and
they
seemed
to
nod
together
the
boys
are
here
isn't
that
nice
more
boys
our
boys
richie
shivered
while
bill
leaned
silver
carefully
against
an
elm
richie
surveyed
the
house
he
saw
a
wheel
sticking
out
of
the
thick
grass
near
the
porch
and
pointed
it
out
to
bill
bill
nodded
it
was
the
overturned
trike
eddie
had
mentioned
they
looked
up
and
down
neibolt
street
the
chug
of
the
diesel
engine
rose
and
fell
off
then
began
again
the
sound
seemed
to
hang
in
the
overcast
like
a
charm
the
street
was
utterly
deserted
richie
could
hear
occasional
cars
passing
on
route
but
could
not
see
them
the
diesel
engine
chugged
and
faded
chugged
and
faded
the
huge
sunflowers
nodded
sagely
together
fresh
boys
good
boys
our
boys
yyyou
rruh
ready
bill
asked
and
richie
jumped
a
little
you
know
i
was
just
thinking
that
maybe
the
last
bunch
of
library
books
i
took
out
are
due
today
richie
said
maybe
i
ought
to
cuhcuhcut
the
ccrap
rrrichie
are
yyou
ready
or
nnnot
guess
i
a
richie
said
knowing
he
was
not
ready
at
all
he
was
never
going
to
be
ready
for
this
scene
they
crossed
the
overgrown
lawn
to
the
porch
luh
look
thththere
bill
said
at
the
far
lefthand
side
the
porch
latticework
skirt
leaned
out
against
a
tangle
of
bushes
both
boys
could
see
the
rusty
nails
that
had
been
pulled
free
there
were
old
rosebushes
here
and
while
the
wses
both
to
the
right
and
the
left
of
the
unanchored
stretch
of
latticework
were
blooming
in
a
lackadaisical
way
those
directly
around
and
in
front
of
it
were
skeletal
and
dead
bill
and
richie
looked
at
each
other
grimly
everything
eddie
said
seemed
true
enough
seven
weeks
later
the
evidence
was
still
here
you
don't
really
want
to
go
under
there
do
you
richie
asked
he
was
almost
pleading
nubnuh
no
bill
said
b
but
i'm
œ
gonna
and
with
a
sinking
heart
richie
saw
that
he
dsolutely
meant
it
that
gray
light
was
back
in
billy
eyes
shining
steadily
there
was
a
stony
eagerness
in
the
lines
of
his
face
that
made
him
look
older
richie
thought
i
think
he
really
does
mean
to
kill
it
if
it
still
there
kill
it
and
maybe
cut
off
its
head
and
take
it
to
his
father
and
say
look
this
is
what
killed
georgie
now
will
you
talk
to
me
again
at
night
maybe
just
tell
me
how
your
day
was
or
who
lost
when
you
guys
were
flipping
to
see
who
paid
for
the
morning
coffee
'
bill
he
said
but
bill
was
no
longer
there
he
was
walking
around
to
the
righthand
end
of
the
porch
where
eddie
must
have
crawled
under
richie
had
to
chase
after
him
and
he
almost
fell
over
the
trike
caught
in
the
weeds
and
slowly
rusting
its
way
into
the
ground
he
caught
up
as
bill
squatted
looking
under
the
porch
there
was
no
skirt
at
all
on
this
end
someone
some
hobo
had
pried
it
off
long
ago
to
gain
access
to
the
shelter
underneath
out
of
the
january
snow
or
the
cold
november
rain
or
a
summer
thundershower
richie
squatted
beside
him
his
heart
thudding
like
a
drum
there
was
nothing
under
the
porch
but
drifts
of
moldering
leaves
yellowing
newspapers
and
shadows
too
many
shadows
bill
he
repeated
whwh
what
bill
had
produced
his
father
walther
again
he
pulled
the
clip
carefully
from
the
grip
and
then
took
four
bullets
from
his
pants
pocket
he
loaded
them
in
one
at
a
tune
richie
watched
this
fascinated
and
then
looked
under
the
porch
again
he
saw
something
else
this
tune
broken
glass
faintly
glinting
shards
of
glass
his
stomach
cramped
painfully
he
was
not
a
stupid
boy
and
he
understood
this
came
close
to
completely
confirming
eddie
story
splinters
of
glass
on
the
moldering
leaves
under
the
porch
meant
that
the
window
had
been
broken
from
inside
from
the
cellar
whwha
bill
asked
again
looking
up
at
richie
his
face
was
grim
and
white
looking
at
that
set
face
richie
mentally
threw
in
the
towel
nothing
he
said
you
cuhcuhhoming
yeah
they
crawled
under
the
porch
the
smell
of
decaying
leaves
was
a
smell
richie
usually
liked
but
there
was
nothing
pleasant
about
the
smell
under
here
the
leaves
felt
spongy
under
his
hands
and
knees
and
he
had
an
impression
that
they
might
go
down
for
two
or
three
feet
he
suddenly
wondered
what
he
would
do
if
a
hand
or
a
claw
sprang
out
of
those
leaves
and
seized
him
bill
was
examining
the
broken
window
glass
had
sprayed
everywhere
the
wooden
strip
which
had
been
between
the
panes
lay
in
two
splintered
pieces
under
the
porch
steps
the
top
of
the
window
frame
jutted
out
like
a
broken
bone
something
hit
that
fucker
wicked
hard
richie
breathed
bill
now
peering
inside
or
trying
tonodded
richie
elbowed
him
aside
enough
so
he
could
look
too
the
basement
was
a
dim
litter
of
crates
and
boxes
the
floor
was
earth
and
like
the
leaves
it
gave
off
a
damp
and
humid
aroma
a
furnace
bulked
to
the
left
thrusting
round
pipes
at
the
low
ceiling
beyond
it
at
the
end
of
the
cellar
richie
could
see
a
large
stall
with
wooden
sides
a
horse
stall
was
his
first
thought
but
who
kept
horses
in
the
jeezly
cellar
then
he
realized
that
in
a
house
as
old
as
this
one
the
furnace
must
have
burned
coal
instead
of
oil
nobody
had
bothered
to
convert
the
furnace
because
no
one
wanted
the
house
that
thing
with
the
sides
was
a
coalbin
to
the
far
right
richie
could
make
out
a
flight
of
stairs
going
up
to
ground
level
now
bill
was
sitting
down
hunching
himself
forward
and
before
richie
could
actually
believe
what
he
was
up
to
his
friend
legs
were
disappearing
into
the
window
bill
he
hissed
chrissake
what
are
you
doing
get
outta
there
bill
didn't
reply
he
slithered
through
scraping
his
duffel
coat
up
from
the
small
of
his
back
barely
missing
a
chunk
of
glass
that
would
have
cut
him
a
good
one
a
second
later
richie
heard
his
tennies
smack
down
on
the
hard
earth
inside
piss
on
this
action
richie
muttered
frantically
to
himself
looking
at
the
square
of
darkness
into
which
his
friend
had
disappeared
bill
you
gone
out
of
your
mind
bill
voice
floated
up
yyou
cccan
stay
up
ththere
if
you
wwant
ruh
ruh
richie
st
stand
¢gguard
instead
he
rolled
over
on
his
belly
and
shoved
his
legs
through
the
cellar
window
before
his
nerve
could
go
bad
on
him
hoping
he
wouldn't
cut
his
hands
or
his
stomach
on
the
broken
glass
something
clutched
his
legs
richie
screamed
le
it
juhjuhhust
mm
bill
hissed
and
a
moment
later
richie
was
standing
beside
him
in
the
cellar
pulling
down
his
shirt
and
his
jacket
wh
who
ddid
you
ththink
it
wwa
the
boogeyma
richie
said
and
laughed
shakily
yyou
g
go
ththat
w
way
and
liim
$g
fuck
that
richie
said
he
could
actually
hear
his
heartbeat
in
his
voice
making
it
sound
bumpy
and
uneven
first
up
and
then
down
tm
stickin
with
you
big
bill
they
moved
toward
the
coalpit
first
bill
slightly
in
the
lead
the
gun
in
his
hand
richie
close
behind
him
trying
to
look
everywhere
at
once
bill
stood
beyond
one
of
the
coalpit
jutting
wooden
sides
for
a
moment
and
then
suddenly
darted
around
it
pointing
the
gun
with
both
hands
richie
squinched
his
eyes
shut
steeling
himself
for
the
explosion
it
didn't
come
he
opened
his
eyes
again
cautiously
nuhnuh
nothin
but
cccoa
bill
said
and
giggled
nervously
richie
stepped
up
beside
bill
and
looked
there
was
still
a
drift
of
old
coal
piled
up
almost
to
the
ceiling
at
the
back
of
the
stall
and
trickling
away
to
a
lump
or
two
by
their
feet
it
was
as
black
as
a
crow
wing
let
richie
began
and
then
the
door
at
the
head
of
the
cellar
stairs
crashed
open
against
the
wall
with
a
violent
bang
spilling
thin
white
daylight
down
the
stairs
both
boys
screamed
richie
heard
snarling
sounds
they
were
very
loud
the
sounds
a
wild
animal
in
a
cage
might
make
he
saw
loafers
descend
the
steps
faded
jeans
on
top
of
them
swinging
hands
but
they
weren't
hands
they
were
paws
huge
misshapen
paws
cuhcuhclimb
the
cccoa
bill
was
screaming
but
richie
stood
frozen
suddenly
knowing
what
was
coming
for
them
what
was
going
to
kill
them
in
this
cellar
that
stank
of
damp
earth
and
the
cheap
wine
that
had
teen
spilled
in
the
comers
knowing
but
needing
to
see
there
a
wuhwuhwindow
at
the
ttop
of
the
ccoa
the
paws
were
covered
with
dense
brown
hair
that
curled
and
coiled
like
wire
the
fingers
were
tipped
with
jagged
nails
now
richie
saw
a
silk
jacket
it
was
black
with
orange
piping
the
derry
high
school
colors
ggg
bill
screamed
and
gave
richie
a
gigantic
shove
richie
went
sprawling
into
the
coal
sharp
jags
and
comers
of
it
poked
him
painfully
breaking
through
his
daze
more
coal
avalanched
over
his
hands
that
mad
snarling
went
on
and
on
panic
slipped
its
hood
over
richie
mind
barely
aware
of
what
he
was
doing
he
scrambled
up
the
mountain
of
coal
gaining
ground
sliding
back
lunging
upward
again
screaming
as
le
went
the
window
at
the
top
was
grimed
black
with
coaldust
and
let
in
next
to
no
light
at
all
it
was
latched
shut
richie
seized
the
latch
which
was
of
the
sort
that
turned
and
threw
all
his
weight
against
it
the
latch
moved
not
at
all
the
snarling
was
closer
now
the
gun
went
off
below
him
the
sound
nearly
deafening
in
the
closed
room
gunsmoke
sharp
and
acrid
stung
richie
nose
it
shocked
him
back
to
some
sort
of
awareness
and
he
realized
that
he
had
been
trying
to
turn
the
thumblatch
the
wrong
way
he
reversed
the
direction
of
the
force
he
was
applying
and
the
latch
gave
with
a
protracted
rusty
squeal
coaldust
sifted
down
on
his
hands
like
pepper
the
gun
went
off
again
with
a
second
deafening
bang
bill
denbrough
shouted
you
killed
my
brother
you
fucker
for
a
moment
the
creature
which
had
come
down
the
stairs
seemed
to
laugh
seemed
to
speak
it
was
as
if
a
vicious
dog
had
suddenly
begun
to
bark
out
garbled
words
and
for
a
moment
richie
thought
the
thing
in
the
highschool
jacket
snarled
back
i'm
going
to
kill
you
too
richie
bill
screamed
then
and
richie
heard
coal
clattering
and
falling
again
as
bill
scrambled
up
the
snarls
and
roars
continued
wood
splintered
there
were
mingled
barks
and
howls
sounds
out
of
a
cold
nightmare
richie
gave
the
window
a
tremendous
shove
not
caring
if
the
glass
broke
and
cut
his
hands
to
ribbons
he
was
beyond
caring
it
did
not
break
it
swung
outward
on
an
old
steel
hinge
flaked
with
rust
more
coaldust
sifted
down
this
time
on
richie
face
he
wriggled
out
into
the
side
yard
like
an
eel
smelling
sweet
fresh
air
feeling
the
long
grass
whip
at
his
face
he
was
dimly
aware
that
it
was
raining
he
could
see
the
thick
stalks
of
the
giant
sunflowers
green
and
hairy
the
walther
went
off
a
third
time
and
the
beast
in
the
cellar
screamed
a
primitive
sound
of
pure
rage
then
bill
cried
ggot
me
richie
help
it
gggot
m
richie
turned
around
on
his
hands
and
knees
and
saw
the
terrified
circle
of
his
frend
upturned
face
in
the
square
of
the
oversized
cellar
window
through
which
a
winter
load
of
coal
had
once
been
funnelled
each
october
bill
was
lying
spreadeagled
on
the
coal
his
hands
waved
and
clutched
fruitlessly
for
the
window
frame
which
was
just
out
of
reach
his
shirt
and
jacket
were
rucked
up
almost
to
his
breastbone
and
he
was
sliding
backward
no
he
was
being
pulled
backward
by
something
richie
could
barely
see
it
was
a
moving
bulking
shadow
behind
bill
a
shadow
that
snarled
and
gibbered
and
sounded
almost
human
richie
didn't
need
to
see
it
he
had
seen
it
the
previous
saturday
on
the
screen
of
the
aladdin
theater
it
was
mad
totally
mad
but
even
so
it
never
occurred
to
richie
to
doubt
either
his
own
sanity
or
his
conclusion
the
teenage
werewolf
had
bill
denbrough
only
it
wasn't
that
guy
michael
landon
with
a
lot
of
makeup
on
his
face
and
a
lot
of
fake
fur
it
was
real
as
if
to
prove
it
bill
screamed
again
richie
reached
in
and
caught
bill
hands
in
hs
own
the
walther
pistol
was
in
one
of
them
and
for
the
second
time
that
day
richie
looked
into
its
black
eye
only
this
time
it
was
loaded
they
tussled
for
bill
richie
gripping
his
hands
the
werewolf
gripping
his
ankles
ggget
out
of
hhere
richie
bill
screamed
gget
the
face
of
the
werewolf
suddenly
swam
out
of
the
dark
its
forehead
was
low
and
prognathous
covered
with
scant
hair
its
cheeks
were
hollow
and
furry
its
eyes
were
a
dark
brown
filled
with
horrible
intelligence
horrible
awareness
its
mouth
dropped
open
and
it
began
to
snarl
white
foam
ran
from
the
corners
of
its
thick
lower
lip
in
twin
streams
that
dripped
from
its
chin
the
hair
on
its
head
was
swept
back
in
a
gruesome
parody
of
a
teenager
d.a
it
threw
its
head
back
and
roared
its
eyes
never
leaving
richie
bill
scrambled
up
the
coal
richie
seized
his
forearms
and
pulled
for
a
moment
he
thought
he
was
actually
going
to
win
then
the
werewolf
laid
hold
of
bill
legs
again
and
he
was
yanked
backward
toward
the
darkness
once
more
it
was
stronger
it
had
laid
hold
of
bill
and
it
meant
to
have
him
then
with
no
thought
at
all
about
what
he
was
doing
or
why
he
was
doing
it
richie
heard
the
voice
of
the
irish
cop
coming
out
of
his
mouth
mr
nell
voice
but
this
was
not
richie
tozier
doing
a
bad
imitation
it
wasn't
even
precisely
mr
nell
it
was
the
voice
of
every
irish
beatcop
that
had
ever
lived
and
twirled
a
billy
by
its
rawhide
rope
as
he
tried
the
doors
of
closed
shops
after
midnight
let
go
of
him
boyo
or
i'll
crack
yer
thick
head
i
swear
to
jaysus
leave
go
of
him
now
or
i'll
serve
ye
yer
own
arse
on
a
platter
the
creature
in
the
cellar
let
out
an
earsplitting
roar
of
rage
but
it
seemed
to
richie
that
there
was
another
note
in
that
bellow
as
well
perhaps
fear
or
pain
he
gave
one
more
tremendous
tug
and
bill
flew
out
of
the
window
and
onto
the
grass
he
stared
up
at
richie
with
dark
horrified
eyes
the
front
of
his
jacket
was
smeared
black
with
coal
dust
kwuh
kwuh
quick
bill
panted
he
was
nearly
moaning
he
grabbed
at
richie
shirt
w
w
we
guhguhhotta
richie
could
hear
coal
tumbling
and
avalanching
down
again
a
moment
later
the
werewolf
s
face
filled
the
cellar
window
it
snarled
at
them
its
paws
clutched
at
the
listless
grass
bill
still
had
the
walther
he
had
held
on
to
the
gun
through
all
of
it
now
he
held
it
out
in
both
hands
his
eyes
squinched
down
to
slits
and
pulled
the
trigger
there
was
another
deafening
bang
richie
saw
a
chunk
of
the
werewolf
s
skull
tear
free
and
a
torrent
of
blood
spilled
down
the
side
of
its
face
matting
the
fur
there
and
soaking
the
collar
of
the
school
jacket
it
wore
roaring
it
began
to
climb
out
of
the
window
moving
slowly
dreamily
richie
reached
under
his
coat
and
into
his
back
pocket
he
brought
out
the
envelope
with
the
picture
of
the
sneezing
man
on
it
he
tore
it
open
as
the
bleeding
roaring
creature
pulled
itself
out
of
the
window
forcing
its
way
claws
digging
deep
furrows
in
the
earth
richie
tore
the
packet
open
and
squeezed
it
git
back
in
yer
place
boy
he
ordered
in
the
voice
of
the
irish
cop
a
white
cloud
puffed
into
the
werewolf
s
face
its
roars
suddenly
stopped
it
stared
at
richie
with
almost
comic
surprise
and
made
a
choked
wheezing
sound
its
eyes
red
and
bleary
rolled
toward
richie
and
seemed
to
mark
him
once
and
forever
then
it
began
to
sneeze
it
sneezed
again
and
again
and
again
ropy
strings
of
saliva
flew
from
its
muzzle
greenishblack
clots
of
snot
flew
out
of
its
nostrils
one
of
these
splatted
against
richie
skin
and
burned
there
like
acid
he
wiped
it
away
with
a
scream
of
hurt
and
disgust
there
was
still
anger
in
its
face
but
there
was
also
pain
it
was
unmistakable
bill
might
have
hurt
it
with
his
dad
pistol
but
richie
had
hurt
it
more
first
with
the
voice
of
the
irish
cop
and
then
with
the
sneezing
powder
jesus
if
i
had
some
itching
powder
too
and
maybe
a
joy
buzzer
i
might
be
able
to
kill
it
richie
thought
and
then
bill
grabbed
the
collar
of
his
jacket
and
jerked
him
backward
it
was
well
that
he
did
the
werewolf
stopped
sneezing
as
suddenly
as
it
had
started
and
lunged
at
richie
it
was
quick
too
incredibly
quick
richie
might
have
only
sat
there
with
the
empty
envelope
of
dr
wacky
sneezing
powder
in
one
hand
staring
at
the
werewolf
with
a
kind
of
drugged
wonder
thinking
how
brown
its
fur
was
how
red
the
blood
was
how
nothing
was
in
black
and
white
in
real
life
he
might
have
sat
there
until
its
paws
closed
around
his
neck
and
its
long
nails
pulled
his
throat
out
but
bill
grabbed
him
again
and
pulled
him
to
his
feet
richie
stumbled
after
him
they
ran
around
to
the
front
of
the
house
and
richie
thought
it
won't
dare
chase
us
anymore
we're
on
the
street
now
it
won't
dare
chase
us
won't
dare
won't
dare
but
it
was
coming
he
could
hear
it
just
behind
them
gibbering
and
snarling
and
slobbering
there
was
silver
still
leaning
against
the
tree
bill
jumped
onto
the
seat
and
threw
his
father
pistol
into
the
carrier
basket
where
they
had
carried
so
many
play
guns
richie
chanced
a
glance
behind
him
as
he
flung
himself
onto
the
package
carrier
and
saw
the
werewolf
crossing
the
lawn
toward
them
less
than
twenty
feet
away
now
blood
and
slobber
mixed
on
its
highschool
jacket
white
bone
gleamed
through
its
pelt
about
the
right
temple
there
were
white
smudges
of
sneezing
powder
on
the
sides
of
its
nose
and
richie
saw
two
other
things
which
seemed
to
complete
the
horror
there
was
no
zipper
on
the
thing
jacket
instead
there
were
big
fluffy
orange
buttons
like
pompoms
the
other
thing
was
worse
it
was
the
other
thing
that
made
him
feel
as
if
he
might
faint
or
just
give
up
and
let
it
kill
him
a
name
was
stitched
on
the
jacket
in
gold
thread
the
kind
of
thing
you
could
get
done
down
at
machen
for
a
buck
if
you
wanted
it
stitched
on
the
bloody
left
breast
of
the
werewolf
s
jacket
stained
but
readable
were
the
words
richie
tozier
it
lunged
at
them
go
bill
richie
screamed
silver
began
to
move
but
slowly
much
too
slowly
it
took
bill
so
long
to
get
going
the
werewolf
crossed
the
rutted
path
just
as
bill
pedaled
into
the
middle
of
neibolt
street
blood
splattered
its
faded
jeans
and
looking
back
over
his
shoulder
filled
with
a
kind
of
dreadful
unbreakable
fascination
that
was
akin
to
hypnosis
richie
saw
that
the
seams
of
the
jeans
were
giving
way
in
places
and
tufts
of
coarse
brown
fur
had
sprung
through
silver
wavered
wildly
back
and
forth
bill
was
standing
up
gripping
the
bike
handlebars
from
underneath
head
turned
up
toward
the
cloudy
sky
cords
standing
out
on
his
neck
and
still
the
playing
cards
were
only
firing
single
shots
one
paw
groped
for
richie
he
screamed
miserably
and
ducked
away
from
it
the
werewolf
snarled
and
grinned
it
was
close
enough
so
richie
could
see
the
yellowing
corneas
of
its
eyes
could
smell
sweet
rotten
meat
on
its
breath
its
teeth
were
crooked
fangs
richie
screamed
again
as
it
swung
a
mw
at
him
he
was
sure
it
was
going
to
take
his
head
off
but
the
paw
passed
in
front
of
him
missing
by
no
more
than
an
inch
the
force
of
the
swing
blew
richie
sweaty
hair
back
from
his
forehead
hiyo
silver
awayy
bill
screamed
at
the
top
of
his
voice
he
had
reached
the
top
of
a
short
shallow
hill
not
much
but
enough
to
get
silver
rolling
the
playing
cards
picked
up
speed
and
began
to
burr
along
gill
pumped
the
pedals
madly
silver
stopped
wavering
and
cut
a
straight
course
down
neibolt
street
toward
route
thank
god
thank
god
thank
god
richie
thought
incoherently
thank
the
werewolf
roared
again
oh
my
god
it
sounds
like
it
right
beside
me
and
richie
wind
was
cut
off
as
his
shirt
and
jacket
were
jerked
back
against
his
windpipe
he
made
a
gargling
choking
sound
and
managed
to
grip
bill
middle
just
before
he
was
pulled
off
the
back
of
the
bike
bill
tilted
backward
but
held
on
to
silver
handlebar
grips
for
one
moment
richie
thought
the
big
bike
would
simply
do
a
wheelie
and
spill
both
of
them
off
the
back
then
his
jacket
which
had
been
just
about
ready
for
the
ragbag
anyway
parted
down
the
back
with
a
loud
ripping
noise
that
sounded
weirdly
like
a
big
fart
richie
could
breathe
again
he
looked
around
and
stared
directly
into
those
muddy
murderous
eyes
bill
he
tried
to
howl
it
but
the
word
had
no
force
no
sound
bill
seemed
to
hear
him
anyway
he
pedaled
even
harder
harder
than
he
ever
had
in
his
life
all
his
guts
seemed
to
be
rising
coming
unanchored
he
could
taste
thick
coppery
blood
in
the
back
of
his
throat
his
eyeballs
were
starting
from
their
sockets
his
mouth
hung
open
scooping
air
and
a
crazy
ineluctable
sense
of
exhilaration
filled
him
something
that
was
wild
and
free
and
all
his
own
a
desire
he
stood
on
the
pedals
coaxed
them
battered
them
silver
continued
to
pick
up
speed
he
was
beginning
to
feel
the
road
now
beginning
to
fly
bill
could
feel
him
go
hiyo
silver
he
screamed
again
hiyo
silver
awayy
richie
could
hear
the
fast
rattlethud
of
loafers
on
the
macadam
he
turned
the
werewolf
s
paw
struck
him
above
the
eyes
with
stunning
force
and
for
a
moment
richie
really
did
think
the
top
of
his
head
had
come
off
things
suddenly
seemed
dim
unimportant
sounds
faded
in
and
out
the
color
washed
out
of
the
world
he
turned
back
clinging
desperately
to
bill
warm
blood
ran
into
his
right
eye
stinging
the
paw
swung
again
striking
the
back
fender
this
time
richie
felt
the
bike
waver
crazily
for
a
moment
on
the
verge
of
tipping
over
finally
straightening
out
again
bill
yelled
hiyo
silver
a
way
again
but
that
was
distant
too
like
an
echo
heard
just
before
it
dies
out
richie
closed
his
eyes
and
held
on
to
bill
and
waited
for
the
end
bill
had
also
heard
the
running
steps
and
understood
that
the
clown
hadn't
given
up
yet
but
he
didn't
dare
turn
around
and
look
he
would
know
if
it
caught
up
and
knocked
them
flat
that
was
really
all
he
needed
to
know
come
on
boy
he
thought
give
me
everything
now
everything
you
got
go
silver
go
so
once
again
bill
denbrough
found
himself
racing
to
beat
the
devil
only
now
the
devil
was
a
hideously
grinning
clown
whose
face
sweated
white
greasepaint
whose
mouth
curved
up
in
a
leering
red
vampire
smile
whose
eyes
were
bright
silver
coins
a
clown
who
was
for
some
lunatic
reason
wearing
a
derry
high
school
jacket
over
its
silvery
suit
with
the
orange
ruff
and
the
orange
pompom
buttons
go
boy
go
silver
what
do

say
neibolt
street
blurred
by
him
now
silver
was
starting
to
hum
good
now
had
those
running
footfalls
faded
back
a
bit
he
still
didn't
dare
turn
around
to
see
richie
had
him
in
a
death
grip
he
was
pinching
off
his
wind
and
bill
wanted
to
tell
richie
to
loosen
up
a
little
but
he
didn't
dare
waste
breath
on
that
either
there
up
ahead
like
a
beautiful
dream
was
the
stopsign
marking
the
intersection
of
neibolt
street
and
route
cars
were
passing
back
and
forth
on
witcham
in
his
state
of
exhausted
terror
this
seemed
somehow
like
a
miracle
to
bill
now
because
he
would
have
to
put
on
his
brakes
in
a
moment
or
do
something
really
inventive
he
risked
a
look
back
over
his
shoulder
what
he
saw
caused
him
to
reverse
silver
pedals
with
a
single
snapjerk
silver
skidded
laying
rubber
with
its
locked
rear
tire
and
richie
head
smacked
painfully
into
the
hollow
of
bill
right
shoulder
the
street
was
completely
empty
but
twentyfive
yards
or
so
behind
them
by
the
first
of
the
abandoned
houses
which
formed
a
kind
of
funeral
cortege
leading
up
to
the
trainyards
there
was
a
bright
flick
of
orange
it
lay
close
to
a
stormdrain
cut
into
the
curbing
uhhnh
almost
too
late
bill
realized
that
richie
was
sliding
off
the
back
of
silver
richie
eyes
were
turned
up
so
bill
could
only
see
the
lower
rims
of
the
irises
below
his
upper
lids
the
mended
bow
of
his
glasses
hung
askew
blood
was
flowing
slowly
from
his
forehead
bill
grabbed
his
arm
they
both
slipped
to
the
right
and
silver
overbalanced
they
crashed
to
the
street
in
a
tangle
of
arms
and
legs
bill
barked
his
crazybone
a
good
one
and
shouted
with
pain
richie
eyes
flickered
at
the
sound
am
going
to
show
you
how
to
get
to
thees
treasure
senhorr
but
thees
man
dobbs
ees
plenny
dangerous
richie
said
in
a
snoring
gasp
it
was
his
pancho
vanilla
voice
but
its
floating
unconnected
quality
scared
bill
badly
he
saw
several
coarse
brown
hairs
clinging
to
the
shallow
headwound
on
richie
forehead
they
were
slightly
kinky
like
his
father’s
pubic
hair
they
made
him
feel
even
more
afraid
and
he
fetched
richie
a
strong
smack
upside
the
head
yowc
richie
cried
his
eyes
fluttered
then
opened
wide
what
are
you
hittin
me
for
big
bill
you'll
break
my
glasses
they
ain't
in
very
good
shape
anyway
just
in
case
you
didn't
notice
i
thth
thought
you
w
w
were
duhduhdying
or
sssomething
bill
said
richie
sat
up
slowly
in
the
street
and
put
a
hand
to
his
head
he
groaned
what
hap
and
then
he
remembered
his
eyes
widened
in
sudden
shock
and
terror
and
he
scrambled
around
on
his
knees
gasping
harshly
duhduhdon't
bill
said
it
œg
gone
rrrichie
it
gone
richie
saw
the
empty
street
where
nothing
moved
and
suddenly
burst
into
tears
bill
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
and
then
put
his
arms
around
richie
and
hugged
him
richie
clutched
at
bill
neck
and
hugged
him
back
he
wanted
to
say
something
clever
something
about
how
bill
should
have
tried
the
bullseye
on
the
werewolf
but
nothing
would
come
out
nothing
except
sobs
ddon't
rrichie
bill
said
duhduhduhhh
then
he
burst
into
tears
himself
and
they
only
hugged
each
other
on
their
knees
in
the
street
beside
bill
spilled
bike
and
their
tears
made
clean
streaks
down
their
cheeks
which
were
sooted
with
coaldust
chapter
cleaning
up
somewhere
high
over
new
york
state
on
the
afternoon
of
may
th
beverly
rogan
begins
to
laugh
again
she
stifles
it
in
both
hands
afraid
someone
will
think
she
is
crazy
but
can't
quite
stop
we
laughed
a
lot
back
then
she
thinks
it
is
something
else
another
light
on
in
the
dark
we
were
afraid
all
the
time
but
we
couldn't
stop
laughing
any
more
than
i
can
stop
now
the
guy
sitting
next
to
her
in
the
aisle
seat
is
young
longhaired
goodlooking
he
has
given
her
several
appreciative
glances
since
the
plane
took
off
in
milwaukee
at
half
past
two
almost
two
and
a
half
hours
ago
now
with
a
stop
in
cleveland
and
another
one
in
philly
but
has
respected
her
clear
desire
not
to
talk
after
a
couple
of
conversational
gambits
to
which
she
has
responded
with
politeness
but
no
more
he
opens
his
totebag
and
takes
out
a
robert
ludlum
novel
now
he
closes
it
holding
his
place
with
his
finger
and
says
with
some
concern
everything
cool
with
yo
she
nods
trying
to
make
her
face
serious
and
then
snorts
more
laughter
he
smiles
a
little
puzzled
questioning
tt
nothing
she
says
once
again
trying
to
be
serious
but
it
no
good
the
more
she
tries
to
be
serious
the
more
her
face
wants
to
crack
up
just
like
the
old
days
tt
just
that
all
at
once
i
realized
i
didn't
know
what
airline
i
was
on
only
that
there
was
a
great
big
ddduck
on
the
ssside
but
the
thought
is
too
much
she
goes
off
into
gales
of
merry
laughter
people
look
around
at
her
some
frowning
republic
he
says
pardon
you
are
whizzing
through
the
air
at
four
hundred
and
seventy
miles
an
hour
courtesy
of
republic
airlines
it
on
the
kyag
folder
in
the
seat
pocket
kya
he
pulls
the
folder
which
does
indeed
have
the
republic
logo
on
the
front
out
of
the
pocket
it
shows
where
the
emergency
exits
are
where
the
flotation
devices
are
how
to
use
the
oxygen
masks
how
to
assume
the
crashlanding
position
the
kissyourassgoodbye
folde
he
says
and
this
time
they
both
burst
out
laughing
he
really
is
goodlooking
she
thinks
suddenly
it
is
a
fresh
thought
somehow
clear
eyed
the
sort
of
thought
you
might
expect
to
have
upon
waking
when
your
mind
isn't
all
junked
up
he
wearing
a
pullover
sweater
and
faded
jeans
his
darkish
blond
hair
is
tied
back
with
a
piece
of
rawhide
and
this
makes
her
think
of
the
ponytail
she
always
wore
her
hair
in
when
she
was
a
kid
she
thinks
i
bet
he
got
a
nice
polite
collegeboy
cock
long
enough
to
jazz
with
not
thick
enough
to
be
really
arrogant
she
starts
to
laugh
again
totally
unable
to
help
it
she
realizes
she
doesn't
even
have
a
handkerchief
with
which
to
wipe
her
streaming
eyes
and
this
makes
her
laugh
harder
you
better
get
yourself
under
control
or
the
stewardess
will
throw
you
off
the
plan
he
says
solemnly
and
she
only
shakes
her
head
laughing
her
sides
and
her
stomach
hurt
now
he
hands
her
a
clean
white
handkerchief
and
she
uses
it
somehow
this
helps
her
to
get
it
under
control
finally
she
doesn't
stop
all
at
once
though
it
just
sort
of
tapers
off
into
little
hitchings
and
gaspings
every
now
and
then
she
thinks
of
the
big
duck
on
the
side
of
the
plane
and
belches
out
another
little
stream
of
giggles
she
passes
his
handkerchief
back
after
a
bit
thank
you
jesus
ma'am
what
happened
to
your
han
he
holds
it
for
a
moment
concerned
she
looks
down
at
it
and
sees
the
torn
fingernails
the
ones
she
ripped
down
to
the
quick
tipping
the
vanity
over
on
tom
the
memory
of
doing
that
hurts
more
than
the
fingernails
themselves
and
that
stops
the
laughter
for
good
she
takes
her
hand
away
from
him
but
gently
slammed
it
in
the
car
door
at
the
airport
she
says
thinking
of
all
the
times
she
has
lied
about
things
tom
has
done
to
her
and
all
the
times
she
lied
about
the
bruises
her
father
put
on
her
is
this
the
last
time
the
last
lie
how
wonderful
that
would
be
almost
too
wonderful
to
be
believed
she
thinks
of
a
doctor
coming
in
to
see
a
terminal
cancer
patient
and
saying
the
xrays
show
the
tumor
is
shrinking
we
don't
have
any
idea
why
but
it
happening
tt
must
hurt
like
hel
he
says
took
some
aspirin
she
opens
the
inflight
magazine
again
although
he
probably
knows
she
been
through
it
twice
already
where
are
you
heade
she
closes
the
magazine
looks
at
him
smiles
you're
very
nice
she
says
but
i
don't
want
to
talk
all
righ
all
righ
he
says
smiling
back
but
if
you
want
to
drink
to
the
big
duck
on
the
side
of
the
plane
when
we
get
to
boston
i'm
buying
thank
you
but
i
have
another
plane
to
catch
boy
was
my
horoscope
ever
wrong
this
mornin
he
says
and
reopens
his
novel
but
you
sound
great
when
you
laugh
a
guy
could
fall
in
love
she
opens
the
magazine
again
but
finds
herself
looking
at
her
jagged
nails
instead
of
the
article
on
the
pleasures
of
new
orleans
there
are
purple
bloodblisters
under
too
of
them
in
her
mind
she
hears
tom
screaming
down
the
stairwell
ti
kill
you
you
bitch
you
fucking
bitch
she
shivers
cold
a
bitch
to
tom
a
bitch
to
the
seamstresses
who
goofed
up
before
important
shows
and
took
a
beverly
rogan
reaming
for
it
a
bitch
to
her
father
long
before
either
tom
or
the
hapless
seamstresses
became
part
of
their
lives
a
bitch
you
bitch
you
fucking
bitch
she
closes
her
eyes
momentarily
her
foot
cut
on
a
shard
of
perfume
bottle
as
she
fled
their
bedroom
throbs
more
than
her
fingers
kay
gave
her
a
bandaid
a
pair
of
shoes
and
a
check
for
a
thousand
dollars
which
beverly
cashed
promptly
at
nine
o'clock
at
the
first
bank
of
chicago
in
water
tower
square
over
kay
protests
beverly
wrote
her
own
check
for
a
thousand
dollars
on
a
plain
sheet
of
typing
paper
i
read
once
that
they
have
to
take
a
check
no
matter
what
it
written
o
she
told
kay
her
voice
seemed
to
be
coming
from
somewhere
else
a
radio
in
another
room
maybe
someone
cashed
a
check
once
that
was
written
on
an
artillery
shell
i
read
that
in
the
book
of
lists
z
think
she
paused
then
laughed
uneasily
kay
looked
at
her
soberly
even
solemnly
but
i'd
cash
it
fast
before
tom
thinks
to
freeze
the
accounts
although
she
doesn't
feel
tired
she
is
aware
however
that
by
now
she
must
be
going
purely
on
nerves
and
kay
black
coffee
the
previous
night
seems
like
something
she
must
have
dreamed
she
can
remember
being
followed
by
three
teenaged
boys
who
called
and
whistled
but
didn't
quite
dare
come
right
up
to
her
she
remembers
the
relief
that
washed
over
her
when
she
saw
the
white
fluorescent
glow
of
a
seveneleven
store
spilling
out
onto
the
sidewalks
at
an
intersection
she
went
in
and
let
the
pimplyfaced
counterman
look
down
the
front
of
her
old
blouse
and
talked
him
into
loaning
her
forty
cents
for
the
pay
phone
it
wasn't
hard
the
view
being
what
it
was
she
called
kay
mccall
first
dialing
from
memory
the
phone
rang
a
dozen
times
and
she
began
to
fear
that
kay
was
in
new
york
kay
sleepy
voice
mumbled
it
better
be
good
whoever
you
are
just
as
beverly
was
about
to
hang
up
tt
bev
ka
she
said
hesitated
and
then
plunged
i
need
help
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
and
then
kay
spoke
again
sounding
fully
awake
now
where
are
you
what
happene
t'm
at
a
seveneleven
on
the
comer
of

bev
said
holding
the
other
two
dimes
in
one
sweating
palm
in
the
round
mirror
at
the
back
of
the
store
she
could
see
the
pimply
clerk
staring
at
her
ass
with
deep
and
dreamy
concentration
but
you'll
have
to
pay
the
tab
when
i
get
there
i
don't
have
any
money

is
the
best
fucking
news
since
nixon
resigned
you
get
your
buns
over
here
girl
and
she
paused
and
when
she
spoke
again
her
voice
was
serious
and
so
full
of
kindness
and
love
that
beverly
felt
she
might
weep
thank
god
you
finally
did
it
bev
i
mean
that
thank
god
kay
mccall
is
a
former
designer
who
married
rich
divorced
richer
and
discovered
feminist
politics
in
about
three
years
before
beverly
first
met
her
at
the
time
of
her
greatest
popularity/controversy
she
was
accused
of
having
embraced
feminism
after
using
archaic
chauvinistic
laws
to
take
her
manufacturer
husband
for
every
cent
the
law
would
allow
her
bullshit
kay
had
once
exclaimed
to
beverly
the
people
who
say
that
stuff
never
had
to
go
to
bed
with
sam
chacowicz
two
pumps
a
tickle
and
a
squirt
that
was
ole
sammy
motto
the
only
time
he
could
keep
it
up
for
longer
than
seventy
seconds
was
when
he
was
pulling
off
in
the
tub
i
didn't
cheat
him
i
just
took
my
combat
pay
retroactively
she
wrote
three
books
one
on
feminism
and
the
working
woman
one
on
feminism
and
the
family
one
on
feminism
and
spirituality
the
first
two
were
quite
popular
in
the
three
years
since
her
last
she
had
fallen
out
of
fashion
to
a
degree
and
beverly
thought
it
was
something
of
a
relief
to
her
her
investments
had
done
well
‘feminism
and
capitalism
are
not
mutually
exclusive
thank
go
she
had
once
told
bev
and
now
she
was
a
wealthy
woman
with
a
townhouse
a
place
in
the
country
and
two
or
three
lovers
virile
enough
to
go
the
distance
with
her
in
the
sack
but
not
quite
virile
enough
to
beat
her
at
tennis
when
they
get
that
good
i
drop
them
at
onc
she
said
and
although
kay
clearly
thought
this
was
a
joke
beverly
wondered
if
it
really
was
beverly
called
a
cab
and
when
it
came
she
piled
into
the
back
with
her
suitcase
glad
to
be
away
from
the
clerk
eyes
and
gave
the
driver
kay
address
she
was
waiting
at
the
end
of
her
driveway
wearing
her
mink
coat
over
a
flannel
nightgown
pink
fuzzy
mules
with
great
big
pompoms
were
on
her
feet
not
orange
pompoms
thank
god
that
might
have
sent
beverly
screaming
into
the
night
again
the
ride
over
to
kay
had
been
weird
things
were
coming
back
to
her
memories
pouring
in
so
fast
and
so
clearly
that
it
was
frightening
she
felt
as
if
someone
had
started
up
a
big
bulldozer
in
her
head
and
begun
excavating
a
mental
graveyard
she
hadn't
even
known
was
there
only
it
was
names
instead
of
bodies
that
were
turning
up
names
she
hadn't
thought
of
in
years
ben

especially
bill
stuttering
bill
they
had
called
him
with
that
openness
of
children
that
is
sometimes
called
candor
sometimes
cruelty
he
had
seemed
so
tall
to
her
so
perfect
until
he
opened
his
mouth
and
started
to
talk
that
was
names
places
things
that
had
happened
alternately
hot
and
cold
she
had
remembered
the
voices
from
the
drain
and
the
blood
she
had
screamed
and
her
father
had
popped
her
one
her
father
tom

threatened
and
then
kay
was
paying
the
cabdriver
and
tipping
him
big
enough
to
make
the
startled
cabbie
exclaim
thanks
lady
wo

took
her
into

house
got
her
into
the
shower
gave
her
a

when
she
got

coffee
examined
her
injuries
mercurochromed

foot
and
put

it
she
poured
a
generous
dollop
of
brandy
into

cup
of
coffee
and
hectored
her
into
drinking
every
drop
then
she
cooked
them

a
rare
strip
steak
and
sauteed
fresh
mushrooms
to
go
with
them
all
right
she
said
what
happened
do
we
call
the
cops
or
just
send
you
to
reno
to
do
your
residency
'
can't
tell
you
too
muc
beverly
said
it
would
sound
too
crazy
but
it
was
my
fault
mostly
kay
slammed
her
hand
down
on
the
table
it
made
a
sound
on
the
polished
mahogany
like
a
smallcaliber
pistol
shot
bev
jumped
don't
you
say
tha
kay
said
there
was
high
color
in
her
cheeks
and
her
brown
eyes
were
blazing
how
long
have
we
been
friends
nine
years
ten
if
i
hear
you
say
it
was
your
fault
one
more
time
i'm
going
to
puke
you
hear
me
i'm
just
going
to
fucking
puke
it
wasn't
your
fault
this
time
or
last
time
or
the
time
before
or
any
of
the
times
don't
you
know
most
of
your
friends
thought
that
sooner
or
later
he'd
put
you
in
a
body
cast
or
maybe
even
kill
yo
beverly
was
looking
at
her
wideeyed
and
that
would
have
been
your
fault
at
least
to
a
degree
for
staying
there
and
letting
it
happen
but
now
you're
gone
thank
god
for
small
favors
but
don't
you
sit
there
with
half
of
your
fingernails
ripped
off
and
your
foot
cut
open
and
beltmarks
on
your
shoulders
and
tell
me
it
was
your
fault
he
didn't
use
his
belt
on
m
bev
said
the
lie
was
automatic
and
so
was
the
deep
shame
which
brought
a
miserable
flush
to
her
cheeks
if
you're
done
with
tom
you
ought
to
be
done
with
the
lies
as
well
kay
said
quietly
and
she
looked
at
bev
so
long
and
so
lovingly
that
bev
had
to
drop
her
eyes
she
could
taste
salt
tears
in
the
back
of
her
throat
who
did
you
think
you
were
foolin
kay
asked
still
speaking
quietly
she
reached
across
the
table
and
took
ben
hands
the
dark
glasses
the
blouses
with
high
necks
and
long
sleeves
maybe
you
fooled
a
buyer
or
two
but
you
can't
fool
your
friends
bev
not
the
people
who
love
you
and
then
beverly
did
cry
long
and
hard
and
kay
held
her
and
later
just
before
going
to
bed
she
told
kay
what
she
could
that
an
old
friend
from
derry
maine
where
she
had
grown
up
had
called
and
had
reminded
her
of
a
promise
she
had
made
long
ago
the
time
to
fulfill
the
promise
had
arrived
he
said
would
she
come
she
said
she
would
then
the
trouble
with
tom
had
started
what
was
this
promise
'
kay
asked
beverly
shook
her
head
slowly
i
can't
tell
you
that
kay
much
as
i'd
like
to
kay
chewed
on
this
and
then
nodded
all
right
fair
enough
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
tom
when
you
get
back
from
maine
'
and
bev
who
had
begun
to
feel
more
and
more
that
she
wouldn't
be
coming
back
from
derry
ever
said
only
t'll
come
to
you
first
and
we'll
decide
together
oka
very
much
oka
kay
said
is
that
a
promise
to
as
soon
as
i'm
bac
bev
said
steadily
you
can
count
on
it
and
she
hugged
kay
hard
with
kay
check
cashed
and
kay
shoes
on
her
feet
she
had
taken
a
greyhound
north
to
milwaukee
afraid
that
tom
might
have
gone
out
to
o'hare
to
look
for
her
kay
who
had
gone
with
her
to
the
bankand
the
bus
depot
tried
to
talk
her
out
of
it
o'hare
lousy
with
security
people
dea
she
said
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
him
if
he
comes
near
you
what
you
do
is
scream
your
fucking
head
off
beverly
shook
her
head
i
want
to
avoid
him
altogether
this
is
the
way
to
do
it
kay
looked
at
her
shrewdly
you're
afraid
he
might
talk
you
out
of
it
aren't
yo
beverly
thought
of
the
seven
of
them
standing
in
the
stream
of
stanley
and
his
piece
of
broken
coke
bottle
glinting
greenly
in
the
sun
she
thought
of
the
thin
pain
as
he
cut
her
palm
lightly
on
a
slant
she
thought
of
them
clasping
hands
in
a
children
circle
promising
to
come
back
if
it
ever
started
again
to
come
back
and
kill
it
for
good
no
she
said
he
couldn't
talk
me
out
of
this
but
he
might
hurt
me
security
guards
or
not
you
didn't
see
him
last
night
kay
tve
seen
him
enough
on
other
occasions
kay
said
her
brows
drawing
together
the
asshole
that
walks
like
a
man
he
was
craz
bev
said
security
guards
might
not
stop
him
this
is
better
believe
me
all
right
kay
said
reluctantly
and
bev
thought
with
some
amusement
that
kay
was
disappointed
that
there
was
going
to
be
no
confrontation
no
big
blowoff
cash
the
check
quic
beverly
told
her
again
before
he
can
think
to
freeze
the
accounts
he
will
you
know
sure
kay
said
if
he
does
that
i'll
go
see
the
son
of
a
bitch
with
a
horsewhip
and
take
it
out
in
trade
you
stay
away
from
hi
beverly
said
sharply
he’s
dangerous
kay
believe
me
he
was
like
like
my
father
was
what
trembled
on
her
lips
instead
she
said
he
was
like
a
wildman
oka
kay
said
be
easy
in
your
mind
dear
go
keep
your
promise
and
do
some
thinking
about
what
comes
after
will
bev
said
but
that
was
a
lie
she
had
too
many
other
things
to
think
about
what
had
happened
the
summer
she
was
eleven
for
instance
showing
richie
tozier
how
to
make
his
yoyo
sleep
for
instance
voices
from
the
drain
for
instance
and
something
she
had
seen
something
so
horrible
that
even
then
embracing
kay
for
the
last
time
by
the
long
silvery
side
of
the
grumbling
greyhound
bus
her
mind
would
not
quite
let
her
see
it
now
as
the
plane
with
the
duck
on
the
side
begins
its
long
descent
into
the
boston
area
her
mind
turns
to
that
again
and
to
stan
uris
and
to
an
unsigned
poem
that
came
on
a
postcard
and
the
voices
and
to
those
few
seconds
when
she
had
been
eye
to
eye
with
something
that
was
perhaps
infinite
she
looks
out
the
window
looks
down
and
thinks
that
tom
evil
is
a
small
and
petty
thing
compared
with
the
evil
waiting
for
her
in
derry
if
there
is
a
compensation
is
that
bill
denbrough
will
be
there
and
there
was
a
time
when
an
elevenyearold
girl
named
beverly
marsh
loved
bill
denbrough
she
remembers
the
postcard
with
the
lovely
poem
written
on
the
back
and
remembers
that
she
once
knew
who
wrote
it
she
doesn't
remember
anymore
any
more
than
she
remembers
exactly
what
the
poem
said
but
she
thinks
it
might
have
been
bill
yes
it
might
well
have
been
stuttering
bill
denbrough
she
thinks
suddenly
of
getting
ready
for
bed
the
night
after
richie
and
ben
took
her
to
see
those
two
honor
movies
after
her
first
date
she
had
cracked
wise
with
richie
about
it
in
those
days
that
had
been
her
defense
when
she
was
out
on
the
street
but
a
pan
of
her
had
been
touched
and
excited
and
a
little
scared
it
really
had
been
her
first
date
even
though
there
had
been
two
boys
instead
of
one
richie
had
paid
her
way
and
everything
just
like
a
real
date
then
afterward
there
had
been
those
boys
who
chased
them
and
they
had
spent
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
in
the
barrens
and
bill
denbrough
had
come
down
with
another
kid
she
couldn't
remember
who
but
she
remembered
the
way
bill
eyes
had
rested
on
hers
for
a
moment
and
the
electric
shock
she
had
felt
the
shock
and
a
flush
that
seemed
to
warm
her
entire
body
she
remembers
thinking
of
all
these
things
as
she
pulled
on
her
nightgown
and
went
into
the
bathroom
to
wash
her
face
and
brush
her
teeth
she
remembers
thinking
that
it
would
take
her
a
long
time
to
get
to
sleep
that
night
because
there
was
so
much
to
think
about
and
to
think
about
in
a
good
way
because
they
seemed
like
good
kids
like
kids
you
could
maybe
goof
with
and
maybe
even
trust
a
little
bit
that
would
be
nice
that
would
be
well
like
heaven
and
thinking
these
things
she
took
her
washcloth
and
leaned
over
the
basin
to
get
some
water
and
the
voice
came
whispering
out
of
the
drain
help
me
beverly
drew
back
startled
the
dry
washcloth
dropping
onto
the
floor
she
shook
her
head
a
little
as
if
to
clear
it
and
then
she
bent
over
the
basin
again
and
looked
curiously
at
the
drain
the
bathroom
was
at
the
back
of
their
fourroom
apartment
she
could
hear
faintly
some
western
program
going
on
the
tv
when
it
was
over
her
father
would
probably
switch
over
to
a
baseball
game
or
the
fights
and
then
go
to
sleep
in
his
easy
chair
the
wallpaper
in
here
was
a
hideous
pattern
of
frogs
on
lily
pads
it
bulged
and
swayed
over
the
lumpy
plaster
beneath
it
was
watermarked
in
some
places
actually
peeling
away
in
others
the
tub
was
rustmarked
the
toilet
seat
cracked
one
naked
watt
bulb
jutted
from
a
porcelain
socket
over
the
basin
beverly
could
remember
vaguely
that
there
had
once
been
a
light
fixture
but
it
had
been
broken
some
years
ago
and
never
replaced
the
floor
was
covered
with
linoleum
from
which
the
pattern
had
faded
except
for
a
small
patch
under
the
sink
not
a
very
cheery
room
but
beverly
had
used
it
so
long
that
she
no
longer
noticed
what
it
looked
like
the
washbasin
was
also
waterstained
the
drain
was
a
simple
crosshatched
arcle
about
two
inches
in
diameter
there
had
once
been
a
chrome
facing
but
that
was
also
long
gone
a
rubber
drainplug
on
a
chain
was
looped
nonchalantly
over
the
faucet
marked
c
the
drain
hole
was
pipedark
and
as
she
leaned
over
it
she
noticed
for
the
first
time
that
there
was
a
faint
unpleasant
smell
a
slightly
fishy
smell
coming
from
the
drain
she
wrinkled
her
nose
a
little
in
disgust
help
me
she
gasped
it
was
a
voice
she
had
thought
perhaps
a
rattle
in
the
pipes
or
maybe
just
her
imagination
some
holdover
from
those
movies
help
me
beverly

alternate
waves
of
coldness
and
warmth
swept
her
she
had
taken
the
rubber
band
out
of
her
hair
which
lay
spread
across
her
shoulders
in
a
bright
cascade
she
could
feel
the
roots
trying
to
stiffen
unaware
that
she
meant
to
speak
she
bent
over
the
basin
again
and
halfwhispered
hello
is
someone
there
the
voice
from
the
drain
had
been
that
of
a
very
young
child
who
had
perhaps
just
learned
to
talk
and
in
spite
of
the
gooseflesh
on
her
arms
her
mind
searched
for
some
rational
explanation
it
was
an
apartment
house
the
marshes
lived
in
the
back
apartment
on
the
ground
floor
there
were
four
other
apartments
maybe
there
was
a
kid
in
the
building
amusing
himself
by
calling
into
the
drain
and
some
trick
of
sound
is
someone
there
she
asked
the
drain
in
the
bathroom
louder
this
time
it
suddenly
occurred
to
her
that
if
her
father
happened
to
come
in
just
now
he
would
think
her
crazy
there
was
no
answer
from
the
drain
but
that
unpleasant
smell
seemed
stronger
it
made
her
think
of
the
bamboo
patch
in
the
barrens
and
the
dump
beyond
it
it
called
up
images
of
slow
bitter
smokes
and
black
mud
that
wanted
to
suck
the
shoes
off
your
feet
there
were
no
really
little
kids
in
the
building
that
was
the
thing
the
tremonts
had
had
a
boy
who
was
five
and
girls
who
were
three
and
six
months
but
mr
tremont
had
lost
his
job
at
the
shoe
shop
on
tracker
avenue
they
got
behind
on
the
rent
and
one
day
not
long
before
school
let
out
they
had
all
just
disappeared
in
mr
tremont
rusty
old
powerflite
buick
there
was
skipper
bolton
in
the
front
apartment
on
the
second
floor
but
skipper
was
fourteen
we
all
want
to
meet
you
beverly
her
hand
went
to
her
mouth
and
her
eyes
widened
in
horror
for
a
moment
just
for
a
moment
she
believed
she
had
seen
something
moving
down
there
she
was
suddenly
aware
that
her
hair
was
now
hanging
over
her
shoulders
in
two
thick
sheaves
and
that
they
dangled
close
very
close
to
that
drainhole
some
clear
instinct
made
her
straighten
up
quick
and
get
her
hair
away
from
there
she
looked
around
the
bathroom
door
was
firmly
closed
she
could
hear
the
tv
faintly
cheyenne
bodie
warning
the
bad
guy
to
put
the
gun
down
before
someone
got
hurt
she
was
alone
except
of
course
for
that
voice
who
are
you
she
called
into
the
basin
pitching
her
voice
low
matthew
clements
the
voice
whispered
the
clown
took
me
down
here
in
the
pipes
and
i
died
and
pretty
soon
he'll
come
and
take
you
beverly
and
ben
hanscom
and
bill
denbrough
and
eddie
her
hands
flew
to
her
cheeks
and
clutched
them
her
eyes
widened
widened
widened
she
felt
her
body
growing
cold
now
the
voice
sounded
choked
and
ancient
and
still
it
crawled
with
corrupted
glee
you'll
float
down
here
with
your
friends
beverly
we
all
float
down
here
tell
bill
that
georgie
says
hello
tell
bill
that
georgie
misses
him
but
he'll
see
him
soon
tell
him
georgie
will
be
in
the
closet
some
night
with
a
piece
of
piano
wire
to
stick
in
his
eye
tell
him
the
voice
broke
up
in
a
series
of
choking
hiccups
and
suddenly
a
bright
red
bubble
backed
up
the
drain
and
popped
spraying
beads
of
blood
on
the
distained
porcelain
the
choking
voice
spoke
rapidly
now
and
as
it
spoke
it
changed
now
it
was
the
young
voice
of
the
child
that
she
had
first
heard
now
it
was
a
teenaged
girl
voice
now
horribly
it
became
the
voice
of
a
girl
beverly
had
known
veronica
grogan
but
veronica
was
dead
she
had
been
found
dead
in
a
sewerdrain
i'm
matthew
i'm
betty

here
down
here
with
the
clown
and
the
creature
and
the
mummy
and
the
werewolf
and
you
beverly
we're
down
here
with
you
and
we
float
we
change
a
gout
of
blood
suddenly
belched
from
the
drain
splattering
the
sink
and
the
mirror
and
the
wallpaper
with
its
frogsandllypads
pattern
beverly
screamed
suddenly
and
piercingly
she
backed
away
from
the
sink
struck
the
door
rebounded
clawed
it
open
and
ran
for
the
living
room
where
her
father
was
just
getting
to
his
feet
what
the
sam
hill
wrong
with
you
he
asked
his
brows
drawing
together
the
two
of
them
were
here
alone
this
evening
bev
mom
was
working
the
threetoeleven
shift
at
green
farm
derry
best
restaurant
the
bathroom
she
cried
hysterically
the
bathroom
daddy
in
the
bathroom
was
someone
peekin
at
you
beverly
huh
his
arm
shot
out
and
his
hand
gripped
her
arm
hard
sinking
into
the
flesh
there
was
concern
on
his
face
but
it
was
a
predatory
concern
somehow
more
frightening
than
comforting
no
the
sink
in
the
sink
the
the
she
burst
into
hysterical
tears
before
she
could
say
anything
more
her
heart
was
thundering
so
hard
in
her
chest
that
she
thought
it
would
choke
her
al
marsh
thrust
her
aside
with
an
ojesuschristwhatnex
expression
on
his
face
and
went
into
the
bathroom
he
was
in
there
so
long
that
beverly
became
afraid
again
then
he
bawled
beverly
you
come
here
girl
there
was
no
question
of
not
going
if
the
two
of
them
had
been
standing
on
the
edge
of
a
high
cliff
and
he
had
told
her
to
step
off
nght
now
girl
her
instinctive
obedience
would
almost
certainly
have
carried
her
over
the
edge
before
her
rational
mind
could
have
intervened
the
bathroom
door
was
open
there
her
father
stood
a
big
man
who
was
now
losing
the
redaubum
hair
he
had
passed
on
to
beverly
he
was
still
wearing
his
gray
fatigue
pants
and
his
gray
shirt
he
was
a
janitor
at
the
derry
home
hospital
and
he
was
looking
hard
at
beverly
he
did
not
drink
he
did
not
smoke
he
did
not
chase
after
women
j
got
all
the
women
i
need
at
home
he
said
on
occasion
and
when
he
said
it
a
peculiar
secretive
smile
would
cross
his
face
it
did
not
brighten
it
but
did
quite
the
opposite
watching
that
smile
was
like
watching
the
shadow
of
a
cloud
travel
rapidly
across
a
rocky
field
they
take
care
of
me
and
when
they
need
it
i
take
care
of
them
now
just
what
the
sam
hill
is
this
foolishness
all
about
he
asked
as
she
came
in
beverly
felt
as
if
her
throat
had
been
lined
with
slate
her
heart
raced
in
her
chest
she
thought
that
she
might
vomit
soon
there
was
blood
on
the
mirror
running
in
long
drips
there
were
spots
of
blood
on
the
light
over
the
sink
she
could
smell
it
cooking
onto
the
watt
bulb
blood
ran
down
the
porcelain
sides
of
the
sink
and
plopped
in
fat
drops
on
the
linoleum
floor
daddy
she
whispered
huskily
he
turned
disgusted
with
her
as
he
was
so
often
and
began
casually
to
wash
his
hands
in
the
bloody
sink
good
god
girl
speak
up
you
scared
hell
out
of
me
explain
yourself
for
lord
sake
he
was
washing
his
hands
in
the
basin
she
could
see
blood
staining
the
gray
fabric
of
his
pants
where
they
rubbed
against
the
lip
of
the
sink
and
if
his
forehead
touched
the
mirror
it
was
close
it
would
be
on
his
skin
she
made
a
choked
noise
in
her
throat
he
turned
off
the
water
grabbed
a
towel
on
which
two
fans
of
blood
from
the
drain
had
splashed
and
began
to
dry
his
hands
she
watched
near
swooning
as
he
grimed
blood
into
his
big
knuckles
and
the
lines
of
his
palms
she
could
see
blood
under
his
fingernails
like
marks
of
guilt
well
i'm
waiting
he
tossed
the
bloody
towel
back
over
the
rod
there
was
blood
blood
everywhere
and
her
father
didn't
see
it
daddy
she
had
no
idea
what
might
have
come
next
but
her
father
interrupted
her
i
worry
about
you
al
marsh
said
i
don't
think
you're
ever
going
to
grow
up
beverly
you
go
out
running
around
you
don't
do
hardly
any
of
the
housework
around
here
you
can't
cook
you
can't
sew
half
the
time
you're
off
on
a
cloud
someplace
with
your
nose
stuck
in
a
book
and
the
other
half
you've
got
vapors
and
megrims
i
worry
his
hand
suddenly
swung
and
spatted
painfully
against
her
buttocks
she
uttered
a
cry
her
eyes
fixed
on
his
there
was
a
tiny
stipple
of
blood
caught
in
his
bushy
right
eyebrow
jf
j
look
at
that
long
enough
i'll
just
go
crazy
and
none
of
this
will
matter
she
thought
dimly
i
worry
a
jot
he
said
and
hit
her
again
harder
on
the
arm
above
the
elbow
that
arm
cried
out
and
then
seemed
to
go
to
sleep
she
would
have
a
spreading
yellowishpurple
bruise
there
the
next
day
an
awful
jot
he
said
and
punched
her
in
the
stomach
he
pulled
the
punch
at
the
last
second
and
beverly
lost
only
half
of
her
air
she
doubled
over
gasping
tears
starting
in
her
eyes
her
father
looked
at
her
impassively
he
shoved
his
bloody
hands
in
the
pockets
of
his
trousers
you
got
to
grow
up
beverly
he
said
and
now
his
voice
was
kind
and
forgiving
isn't
that
so
she
nodded
her
head
throbbed
she
cried
but
silently
if
she
sobbed
aloud
started
what
her
father
called
that
baby
whining
he
might
go
to
work
on
her
in
earnest
al
marsh
had
lived
his
entire
life
in
derry
and
told
people
who
asked
and
sometimes
those
who
did
not
that
he
intended
to
be
buried
here
hopefully
at
the
age
of
one
hundred
and
ten
no
reason
why
i
shouldn't
live
forever
he
sometimes
told
roger
aurlette
who
cut
his
hair
once
each
month
i
have
no
vices
now
explain
yourself
he
said
and
make
it
quick
there
was
she
swallowed
and
it
hurt
because
there
was
no
moisture
in
her
throat
none
at
all
there
was
a
spider
a
big
fat
black
spider
it
it
crawled
out
of
the
drain
and
i
i
guess
it
crawled
back
down
oh\
he
smiled
a
little
at
her
now
as
if
pleased
by
this
explanation
was
that
it
damn
if
you'd
told
me
beverly
i
never
would
have
hit
you
all
girls
are
scared
of
spiders
sam
hill
why
didn't
you
speak
up
he
bent
over
the
drain
and
she
had
to
bite
her
lip
to
keep
from
crying
out
a
warning
and
some
other
voice
spoke
deep
inside
her
some
terrible
voice
which
could
not
have
been
a
part
of
her
surely
it
was
the
voice
of
the
devil
himself
let
it
get
him
if
it
wants
him
let
it
pull
him
down
goodfuckingriddance
she
turned
away
from
that
voice
in
horror
to
allow
such
a
thought
to
stay
for
even
a
moment
in
her
head
would
surely
damn
her
to
hell
he
peered
into
the
eye
of
the
drain
his
hands
squelched
in
the
blood
on
the
rim
of
the
basin
beverly
fought
grimly
with
her
gorge
her
belly
ached
where
her
dad
had
hit
her
don't
see
a
thing
he
said
all
these
buildings
are
old
bev
got
drains
the
size
of
freeways
you
know
it
when
i
was
janitorin
down
in
the
old
high
school
we
used
to
get
drowned
rats
in
the
toilet
bowls
once
in
awhile
it
drove
the
girls
crazy
he
laughed
fondly
at
the
thought
of
such
female
vapors
and
megrims
mostly
when
the
kenduskeag
was
high
less
wildlife
in
the
pipes
since
they
put
in
the
new
drain
system
though
he
put
an
arm
around
her
and
hugged
her
look
you
go
to
bed
and
don't
think
about
it
anymore
okay
she
felt
her
love
for
him
j
never
hit
you
when
you
didn't
deserve
it
beverly
he
told
her
once
when
she
had
cried
out
that
some
punishment
had
been
unfair
and
surely
that
had
to
be
true
because
he
was
capable
of
love
sometimes
he
would
spend
a
whole
day
with
her
showing
her
how
to
do
things
or
just
telling
her
stuff
or
walking
around
town
with
her
and
when
he
was
kind
like
that
she
thought
her
heart
would
swell
with
happiness
until
it
killed
her
she
loved
him
and
tried
to
understand
that
he
had
to
correct
her
often
because
it
was
as
he
said
his
godgiven
job
daughters
al
marsh
said
need
more
correction
than
sons
he
had
no
sons
and
she
felt
vaguely
as
if
that
might
be
partly
her
fault
as
well
okay
daddy
she
said
i
won't
they
walked
into
her
small
bedroom
together
her
right
arm
now
ached
fiercely
from
the
blow
it
had
taken
she
looked
back
over
her
shoulder
and
saw
the
bloody
sink
bloody
mirror
bloody
wall
bloody
floor
the
bloody
towel
her
father
had
used
and
then
hung
casually
over
the
rod
she
thought
how
can
i
ever
go
in
there
to
wash
up
again
please
god
dear
god
i'm
sorry
if
i
had
a
bad
thought
about
my
dad
and
you
can
punish
me
for
it
if
you
want
i
deserve
to
be
punished
make
me
fall
down
and
hurt
myself
or
make
me
have
the
flu
like
last
winter
when
i
coughed
so
hard
once
i
threw
up
but
please
god
make
the
blood
be
gone
in
the
morning
pretty
please
god
okay
okay
her
father
tucked
her
in
as
he
always
did
and
kissed
her
forehead
then
he
only
stood
there
for
a
moment
in
what
she
would
always
think
of
as
hi
way
of
standing
perhaps
of
being
bent
slightly
forward
hands
plunged
deep
_
to
above
the
wrist
in
his
pockets
the
bright
blue
eyes
in
his
mournful
basset
hound
face
looking
down
at
her
from
above
in
later
years
long
after
she
stopped
thinking
about
derry
at
all
she
would
see
a
man
sitting
on
the
bus
or
maybe
standing
on
a
comer
with
his
dinnerbucket
in
his
hand
shapes
oh
shapes
of
men
sometimes
seen
as
day
closed
down
sometimes
seen
across
watertower
square
in
the
noonlight
of
a
clear
windy
autumn
day
shapes
of
men
rules
of
men
desires
of
men
or
tom
so
like
her
father
when
he
took
off
his
shirt
and
stood
slightly
slumped
in
front
of
the
bathroom
mirror
to
shave
shapes
of
men
sometimes
i
worry
about
you
be
he
said
but
there
was
no
trouble
or
anger
in
his
voice
now
he
touched
her
hair
gently
smoothing
it
back
from
her
forehead
the
bathroom
is
full
of
blood
daddy
she
almost
screamed
then
didn't
you
see
it
it
everywhere
cooking
onto
the
light
over
the
sink
even
didn't
you
see
it
but
she
kept
her
silence
as
he
went
out
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
filling
her
room
with
darkness
she
was
still
awake
still
staring
into
the
darkness
when
her
mother
came
in
at
eleventhirty
and
the
tv
went
off
she
heard
her
parents
go
into
their
room
and
she
heard
the
bedsprings
creaking
steadily
as
they
did
their
sexact
thing
beverly
had
overheard
greta
bowie
telling
sally
mueller
that
the
sexact
thing
hurt
like
fire
and
no
nice
girl
ever
wanted
to
do
it
at
the
end
of
it
the
man
pees
all
over
your
bug
greta
said
and
sally
had
cried
oh
yuck
i'd
never
let
a
boy
do
that
to
me’
if
it
hurt
as
badly
as
greta
said
then
bev
mother
kept
the
hurt
to
herself
bev
had
heard
her
mom
cry
out
once
or
twice
in
a
low
voice
but
it
hadn't
sounded
at
all
like
a
paincry
the
slow
creak
of
the
springs
speeded
up
to
a
beat
so
rapid
it
was
just
short
of
frantic
and
then
stopped
there
was
a
period
of
silence
then
some
low
talk
then
the
sound
of
her
mother
footsteps
as
she
went
into
the
bathroom
beverly
held
her
breath
waiting
for
her
mother
to
scream
or
not
there
was
no
scream
only
the
sound
of
water
running
into
the
basin
that
was
followed
by
some
low
splashing
then
the
water
ran
out
of
the
basin
with
its
familiar
gurgling
sound
her
mother
was
brushing
her
teeth
now
moments
later
the
bedsprings
in
her
parents
room
creaked
again
as
her
mom
got
back
into
bed
five
minutes
or
so
after
that
her
father
began
to
snore
a
black
fear
stole
over
her
heart
and
closed
her
throat
she
found
herself
afraid
to
turn
over
on
her
right
side
her
favorite
sleeping
position
because
she
might
see
something
looking
in
the
window
at
her
so
she
just
lay
on
her
back
stiff
as
a
poker
looking
up
at
the
pressedtin
ceiling
some
time
later
minutes
or
hours
there
was
no
way
of
telling
she
fell
into
a
thin
troubled
sleep
beverly
always
woke
up
when
the
alarm
went
off
in
her
parents
bedroom
you
had
to
be
fast
because
the
alarm
no
more
than
got
started
before
her
father
banged
it
off
she
dressed
quickly
while
her
father
used
the
bathroom
she
paused
as
she
now
almost
always
did
to
look
at
her
chest
in
the
mirror
trying
to
decide
if
her
breasts
had
gotten
any
bigger
in
the
night
she
had
started
getting
them
late
last
year
there
had
been
some
faint
pain
at
first
but
that
was
gone
now
they
were
extremely
small
not
much
more
than
spring
apples
really
but
they
were
there
it
was
true
childhood
would
end
she
would
be
a
woman
she
smiled
at
her
reflection
and
put
a
hand
behind
her
head
pushing
her
hair
up
and
sticking
her
chest
out
she
giggled
a
little
girl
unaffected
giggle
and
suddenly
remembered
the
blood
spewing
out
of
the
bathroom
drain
the
night
before
the
giggles
stopped
abruptly
she
looked
at
her
arm
and
saw
the
bruise
that
had
formed
there
in
the
mght
an
ugly
stain
between
her
shoulder
and
elbow
a
stain
with
many
discolored
fingers
the
toilet
went
with
a
bang
and
a
flush
moving
quickly
not
wanting
him
to
be
mad
with
her
this
moming
not
wanting
him
to
even
notice
her
this
moming
beverly
pulled
on
a
pair
of
jeans
and
her
derry
high
school
sweatshirt
and
then
because
it
could
no
longer
be
put
off
she
left
her
room
for
the
bathroom
her
father
passed
her
in
the
living
room
on
his
way
back
to
his
room
to
get
dressed
his
blue
pyjama
suit
flapped
loosely
around
him
he
grunted
something
at
her
she
didn't
understand
okay
daddy
she
replied
nevertheless
she
stood
in
front
of
the
closed
bathroom
door
for
a
moment
trying
to
get
her
mind
ready
for
what
she
might
see
inside
at
least
it
daytime
she
thought
and
that
brought
some
comfort
not
much
but
some
she
grasped
the
doorknob
turned
it
and
stepped
inside
that
was
a
busy
morning
for
beverly
she
got
her
father
his
breakfast
orange
juice
scrambled
eggs
al
marsh
version
of
toast
the
bread
hot
but
not
really
toasted
at
all
he
sat
at
the
table
barricaded
behind
the
news
and
ate
it
all
where
the
bacon
gone
daddy
we
finished
it
yesterday
cook
me
a
hamburger
there
only
a
little
bit
of
that
left
the
paper
rustled
then
dropped
his
blue
stare
fell
on
her
like
weight
what
did
you
say
he
asked
softly
i
said
right
away
daddy
he
looked
at
her
a
moment
longer
then
the
paper
went
back
up
and
beverly
hurried
to
the
refrigerator
to
get
the
meat
she
cooked
him
a
hamburger
mashing
the
little
bit
of
ground
meat
that
was
left
in
the
icebox
as
hard
as
she
could
to
make
it
look
bigger
he
ate
it
reading
the
sports
page
and
beverly
made
his
lunch
a
couple
of
peanutbutterandjelly
sandwiches
a
big
piece
of
cake
her
mother
had
brought
back
from
green
farm
last
night
a
thermos
of
hot
coffee
heavily
laced
with
sugar
you
tell
your
mother
i
said
to
get
this
place
cleaned
up
today
he
said
taking
his
dinnerbucket
it
looks
like
a
damn
old
pigsty
sam
hill
i
spend
the
whole
day
cleaning
up
messes
over
to
the
hospital
i
don't
need
to
come
home
to
a
pigsty
you
mind
me
beverly
okay
daddy
i
will
he
kissed
her
cheek
gave
her
a
rough
hug
and
left
as
she
always
did
beverly
went
to
the
window
of
her
room
and
watched
him
walk
down
the
street
and
as
she
always
did
she
felt
a
sneaking
sense
of
relief
when
he
turned
the
comer
and
hated
herself
for
it
she
did
the
dishes
and
then
took
the
book
she
was
reading
out
on
the
back
steps
for
awhile
lars
theramenius
his
long
blonde
hair
glowing
with
its
own
serene
inner
light
toddled
over
from
the
next
building
to
show
beverly
his
new
tonka
truck
and
the
new
scrapes
on
his
knees
beverly
exclaimed
over
both
then
her
mother
was
calling
her
they
changed
both
beds
washed
the
floors
and
waxed
the
kitchen
linoleum
her
mother
did
the
bathroom
floor
for
which
beverly
was
profoundly
grateful
elfrida
marsh
was
a
small
woman
with
graying
hair
and
a
grim
look
her
lined
face
told
the
world
that
she
had
been
around
for
awhile
and
intended
to
stay
around
awhile
longer
it
also
told
the
world
that
none
of
it
had
been
easy
and
she
did
not
look
for
an
early

now
tones
of
grim
horror
crept
into
elfrida
voice
they'll

to
go
on

county

guess
it
was
the
worst
thing
elfrida
marsh
could
think
of
losing
a
child
or
finding
out
you
had
cancer
didn't
hold
a
candle
to
it
you
could
be
poor
you
could
spend
your
life
doing
what
she
called
scratchin
but
at
the
bottom
of
everything
below
even
the
gutter
was
a
time
when
you
might
have
to
go
on
the
county
and
drink
the
worksweat
from
the
brows
of
others
as
a
gift
this
she
knew
was
the
prospect
that
now
faced
chery]
tarrent

the
windows
washed
and
take
the
trash

go

elfrida
said
she
looked
for
a
moment
at
the
nubs
in
beverly
sweatshirt
her
glance
was
loving
but
pitiless
i
don't

what
i'm
going
to
do
around
here
once
you're
married
and
have
a
place
of
your

ti
be
around

just
about

beverly
said
smiling
her
mother
hugged
her
briefly
and
kissed
the
corner
of
her
mouth
with
her
warm
dry
lips
i
know
better
she
said
but
i
love
you
bewvie
i
love
you
too
momma

sure

streaks
on
those
windows
when

she
said
picking
up
her
purse
and
going
to
the
door
if
there
are
you'll
catch
the
blue
devil
from
your
father
til
be
careful
as
her
mother
opened
the
door
to
go
out
beverly
asked
in
a
tone
she
hoped
was
casual
did
you
see
anything
funny
in
the
bathroom
mom
elfrida
looked
back
at
her
frowning
a
little
funn
well
i
saw
a
spider
in
there
last
night
it
crawled
out
of
the
drain
didn't
daddy
tell
you
did
you
get
your
dad
angry
at
you
last
night
bevvie
no
hubuh
i
told
him
a
spider
crawled
out
of
the
drain
and
scared
me
and
he
said
sometimes
they
used
to
find
drowned
rats
in
the
toilets
at
the
old
high
school
because
of
the
drains
he
didn't
tell
you
about
the
spider
i
saw
no
oh
well
it
doesn't
matter
i
just
wondered
if
you
saw
it
didn't
see
any
spider
i
wish
we
could
afford
a
little
new
linoleum
for
that
bathroom
floor
she
glanced
at
the
sky
which
was
blue
and
cloudless
they
say
if
you
kill
a
spider
it
brings
rain
you
didn't
kill
it
did
you
n
beverly
said
i
didn't
kill
it
her
mother
looked
back
at
her
her
lips
pressed
together
so
tightly
they
almost
weren't
there
you
sure
your
dad
wasn't
angry
with
you
last
night
bevvie
does
he
ever
touch
you
what
beverly
looked
at
her
mother
totally
perplexed
god
her
father
touched
her
every
day
i
don't
get
what
you
never
mind
elfrida
said
shortly
don't
forget
the
trash
and
if
those
windows
are
streaked
you
won't
need
your
father
to
give
you
blue
devil
i
won't
does
he
ever
touch
you
forget
and
be
in
before
dark
twill
does
he
worry
an
awful
lot
elfrida
left
beverly
went
into
her
room
again
and
watched
her
around
the
corner
and
out
of
view
as
she
had
her
father
then
when
she
was
sure
her
mother
was
well
on
her
way
to
the
bus
stop
beverly
got
the
floorbucket
the
windex
and
some
rags
from
under
the
sink
she
went
into
the
living
room
and
began
on
the
windows
the
apartmert
seemed
too
quiet
each
time
the
floor
creaked
or
a
door
slammed
she
jumped
a
little
when
the
bolton
toilet
flushed
above
her
she
uttered
a
gasp
that
was
nearly
a
scream
and
she
kept
looking
toward
the
closed
bathroom
door
at
last
she
walked
down
there
and
drew
it
open
again
and
looked
inside
her
mother
had
cleaned
in
here
this
morning
and
most
of
the
blood
which
had
pooled
under
the
sink
was
gone
so
was
the
blood
on
the
sink
rim
but
there
were
still
maroon
streaks
drying
in
the
sink
itself
spots
and
splashes
of
it
on
the
mirror
and
on
the
wallpaper
beverly
looked
at
her
pale
reflection
and
realized
with
sudden
superstitious
dread
that
the
blood
on
the
mirror
made
it
seem
as
if
her
face
was
bleeding
she
thought
again
what
am
i
going
to
do
about
this
have
i
gone
crazy
am
i
imagining
it
the
drain
suddenly
gave
a
burping
chuckle
beverly
screamed
and
slammed
the
door
and
five
minutes
later
her
hands
were
still
trembling
so
badly
that
she
almost
dropped
the
bottle
of
windex
as
she
washed
the
windows
in
the
living
room
it
was
around
three
o'clock
that
afternoon
the
apartment
locked
up
and
the
extra
key
tucked
snugly
away
in
the
pocket
of
her
jeans
when
beverly
marsh
happened
to
turn
up
richard
alley
a
narrow
walkthrough
which
connected
main
and
center
streets
and
came
upon
ben
hanscom
eddie
kaspbrak
and
a
boy
named
bradley
donovan
pitching
pennies
hi
bev
eddie
said
you
get
any
nightmares
from
those
movies
nope
beverly
said
squatting
down
to
watch
the
game
how'd
you
know
about
that
haystack
told
me
eddie
said
jerking
a
thumb
at
ben
who
was
blushing
wildly
for
no
good
reason
beverly
could
see
what
movieth
bradley
asked
and
now
beverly
recognized
him
he
had
come
down
to
the
barrens
a
week
ago
with
bill
denbrough
they
had
a
speech
class
together
in
bangor
beverly
more
or
less
dismissed
him
from
her
mind
if
asked
she
might
have
said
he
seemed
somehow
less
important
than
ben
and
eddie
less
there
couple
of
creature
features
she
said
to
him
and
duckwalked
closer
until
she
was
between
ben
and
eddie
you
pitchi
ye
ben
said
he
looked
at
her
quickly
then
looked
away
who
winning
eddi
ben
said
eddie
real
good
she
looked
at
eddie
who
polished
his
nails
solemnly
on
the
front
of
his
shirt
and
then
giggled
can
i
play
okay
with
me
eddie
said
you
got
pence
she
felt
in
her
pocket
and
brought
out
three
jeez
how
do
you
dare
to
go
out
of
the
house
with
sucha
wa
eddie
asked
t'd
be
scared
ben
and
bradley
donovan
laughed
girls
can
be
brave
too
beverly
said
gravely
and
a
moment
later
they
were
all
laughing
bradley
pitched
first
then
ben
then
beverly
because
he
was
winning
eddie
had
lasties
they
tossed
the
pennies
toward
the
back
wall
of
the
center
street
drug
store
sometimes
they
landed
short
sometimes
they
struck
and
bounced
back
at
the
end
of
each
round
the
shooter
with
the
penny
closest
to
the
wall
collected
all
four
pennies
five
minutes
later
beverly
had
twentyfour
cents
she
had
lost
only
a
single
round
girlth
cheat
bradley
said
disgusted
and
got
up
to
go
his
good
humor
was
gone
and
he
looked
at
beverly
with
both
anger
and
humiliation
girlth
thouldn't
be
allowed
to
ben
bounced
to
his
feet
it
was
awesome
to
watch
ben
hanscom
bounce
take
that
back
bradley
looked
at
ben
his
mouth
open.'what
take
it
back
she
didn't
cheat
bradley
looked
from
ben
to
eddie
to
beverly
who
was
still
on
her
knees
then
he
looked
back
at
ben
again
you
want
a
fat
lip
to
math
the
reth
of
you
athhole
sure
ben
said
and
a
grin
suddenly
crossed
his
face
something
in
its
quality
caused
bradley
to
take
a
surprised
uneasy
step
backward
perhaps
what
he
saw
in
that
grin
was
the
simple
fact
that
after
tangling
with
henry
bowers
and
coming
out
ahead
not
once
but
twice
ben
hanscom
was
not
about
to
be
terrorized
by
skinny
old
bradley
donovan
who
had
warts
all
over
his
hands
as
well
as
that
cataclysmic
lisp
yeah
and
then
you
all
gang
up
on
me
bradley
said
taking
another
step
backward
his
voice
had
picked
up
an
uncertain
waver
and
tears
stood
out
in
his
eyes
all
a
bunth
of
cheatert
you
just
take
back
what
you
said
about
her
ben
said
never
mind
ben
beverly
said
she
held
out
a
handful
of
coppers
to
bradley
take
what
yours
i
wasn't
playing
for
keepsies
anyway
tears
of
humiliation
spilled
over
bradley
lower
lashes
he
struck
the
pennies
from
beverly
hand
and
ran
for
the
center
street
end
of
richard
alley
the
others
stood
looking
at
him
openmouthed
with
safety
within
reach
bradley
turned
around
and
shouted
you're
jutht
a
little
bith
that'th
all
cheater
cheater
your
mother'th
a
whore
beverly
gasped
ben
ran
up
the
alley
toward
bradley
and
succeeded
in
doing
no
more
than
tripping
over
an
empty
crate
and
falling
down
bradley
was
gone
and
ben
knew
better
than
to
believe
he
could
ever
catch
him
he
turned
toward
beverly
instead
to
see
if
she
was
all
right
that
word
had
shocked
him
as
much
as
it
had
her
she
saw
the
concern
in
his
face
she
opened
her
mouth
to
say
she
was
okay
not
to
worry
sticks
and
stones
wilt
break
mybonesbutnameswillneverhurme
and
that
odd
question
her
mother
had
asked
does
he
ever
touch
you
recurred
odd
question
yes
simple
yet
nonsensical
full
of
somehow
ominous
undertones
murky
as
old
coffee
instead
of
saying
that
names
would
never
hurt
her
she
burst
into
tears
eddie
looked
at
her
uncomfortably
took
his
aspirator
from
his
pants
pocket
and
sucked
on
it
then
he
bent
down
and
began
picking
up
the
scattered
pennies
there
was
a
fussy
careful
expression
on
his
face
as
he
did
this
ben
moved
toward
her
instinctively
wanting
to
hug
and
give
comfort
and
then
stopped
she
was
too
pretty
in
the
face
of
that
prettiness
he
felt
helpless
cheer
up
he
said
knowing
it
must
sound
idiotic
but
unable
to
think
of
anything
more
useful
he
touched
her
shoulders
lightly
she
had
put
her
hands
over
her
face
to
hide
her
wet
eyes
and
blotchy
cheeks
and
then
took
them
away
as
if
she
were
too
hot
to
touch
he
was
now
blushing
so
hard
he
looked
apoplectic
cheer
up
beverly
she
lowered
her
hands
and
cried
out
in
a
shrill
furious
voice
my
mother
is
not
a
whore
she
she
a
waitress
this
was
greeted
by
absolute
silence
ben
stared
at
her
with
his
lower
jaw
sprung
ajar
eddie
looked
up
at
her
from
the
cobbled
surface
of
the
alley
his
hands
full
of
pennies
and
suddenly
all
three
of
them
were
laughing
hysterically
a
waitress
eddie
cackled
he
had
only
the
faintest
idea
of
what
a
whore
was
but
something
about
this
comparison
struck
him
as
delicious
just
the
same
is
that
what
she
i
yes
yes
she
i
beverly
gasped
laughing
and
crying
at
the
same
time
ben
was
laughing
so
hard
he
couldn't
stand
up
he
sat
heavily
on
a
trashcan
his
bulk
drove
the
lid
into
the
can
and
spilled
him
into
the
alley
on
his
side
eddie
pointed
at
him
and
howled
with
laughter
beverly
helped
him
to
his
feet
a
window
went
up
above
them
and
a
woman
yelled
you
kids
get
out
of
there
there
people
that
have
to
work
the
night
shift
you
know
get
lost
without
thinking
the
three
of
them
linked
hands
beverly
in
the
middle
and
ran
for
center
street
they
were
still
laughing
they
pooled
their
money
and
discovered
they
had
forty
cents
enough
for
two
icecream
frappes
from
the
drugstore
because
old
mr
keene
was
a
grouch
and
wouldn't
let
kids
under
twelve
eat
their
stuff
at
the
soda
fountain
he
claimed
the
pinball
machines
in
the
back
room
might
corrupt
them
they
took
the
frappes
in
two
huge
waxed
containers
up
to
bassey
park
and
sat
on
the
grass
to
drink
them
ben
had
coffee
eddie
strawberry
beverly
sat
between
the
two
boys
with
a
straw
sampling
each
in
turn
like
a
bee
at
flowers
she
felt
okay
again
for
the
first
time
since
the
drain
had
coughed
up
its
gout
of
blood
the
night
before
washed
out
and
emotionally
exhausted
but
okay
at
peace
with
herself
for
the
time
being
anyway
i
just
don't
get
what
was
wrong
with
bradley
eddie
said
at
last
it
had
the
tone
of
awkward
apology
he
never
acted
like
that
before
you
stood
up
for
m
beverly
said
and
suddenly
kissed
ben
on
one
cheek
thank
you
ben
went
scarlet
again
you
weren't
cheating
he
mumbled
and
abruptly
gulped
down
half
of
his
coffee
frappe
in
three
monster
swallows
this
was
followed
by
a
burp
as
loud
as
a
shotgun
blast
get
any
on
you
daddy
eddie
asked
and
beverly
laughed
helplessly
holding
her
stomach
no
more
she
giggled
my
stomach
hurts
please
no
more
ben
was
smiling
that
night
before
sleep
he
would
play
the
moment
when
she
had
kissed
him
over
and
over
again
in
his
mind
are
you
really
okay
now
he
asked
she
nodded
it
wasn't
him
it
really
wasn't
even
what
he
said
about
my
mother
it
was
something
that
happened
last
night
she
hesitated
looking
from
ben
to
eddie
and
back
to
ben
again
i
i
have
to
tell
somebody
or
show
somebody
or
something
i
guess
i
cried
because
i've
been
scared
i'm
going
looneytunes
what
are
you
talking
about
looneytunes
a
new
voice
asked
it
was
stanley
uris
as
always
he
looked
small
slim
and
preternaturally
neat
much
too
neat
for
a
kid
vho
was
just
barely
eleven
in
his
white
shirt
neatly
tucked
into
his
fresh
jeans
all
the
way
around
his
hair
combed
the
toes
of
his
hightop
keds
spotlessly
clean
he
looked
instead
like
the
world
smallest
adult
then
he
smiled
and
the
illusion
was
broken
she
won't
say
whatever
she
was
going
to
say
eddie
thought
because
he
wasn't
there
when
bradley
called
her
mother
that
name
but
after
a
moment
hesitation
beverly
did
tell
because
somehow
stanley
was
different
from
bradley
he
was
there
in
a
way
bradley
had
not
been
stanley
one
of
us
beverly
thought
and
wondered
why
that
should
cause
her
arms
to
suddenly
break
out
in
bumps
i'm
not
doing
any
of
them
any
favors
by
telling
she
thought
not
them
and
not
me
neither
but
it
was
too
late
she
was
already
speaking
stan
sat
down
with
them
his
face
still
and
grave
eddie
offered
him
the
last
of
the
strawberry
frappe
and
stan
only
shook
his
head
his
eyes
never
leaving
beverly
face
none
of
the
boys
spoke
she
told
them
about
the
voices
about
recognizing
ronnie
grogan
voice
she
knew
ronnie
was
dead
but
it
was
her
voice
all
the
same
she
told
them
about
the
blood
and
how
her
father
had
not
seen
it
or
felt
it
and
how
her
mother
had
not
seen
it
this
morning
when
she
finished
she
looked
around
at
their
faces
afraid
of
what
she
might
see
there
but
she
saw
no
disbelief
terror
but
no
disbelief
finally
ben
said
let
go
look
they
went
in
by
the
back
door
not
just
because
that
was
the
lock
bev
key
fitted
but
because
she
said
her
father
would
kill
her
if
mrs
bolton
saw
her
going
into
the
apartment
with
three
boys
while
her
folks
were
gone
wh
eddie
asked
you
wouldn't
understand
numbnut
stan
said
just
be
quiet
eddie
started
to
reply
looked
again
at
stan
white
strained
face
and
decided
to
keep
his
mouth
shut
the
door
gave
on
the
kitchen
which
was
full
of
lateafternoon
sun
and
summer
silence
the
breakfast
dishes
sparkled
in
the
drainer
the
four
of
them
stood
by
the
kitchen
table
bunched
up
and
when
a
door
slammed
upstairs
they
all
jumped
and
then
laughed
nervously
where
is
it
ben
asked
he
was
whispering
her
heart
thudding
in
her
temples
beverly
led
them
down
the
little
hall
with
her
parents
bedroom
on
one
side
and
the
closed
bathroom
door
at
the
end
she
pulled
it
open
stepped
quickly
inside
and
pulled
the
chain
over
the
sink
then
she
stepped
back
between
ben
and
eddie
again
the
blood
had
dried
to
maroon
smears
on
the
mirror
and
the
basin
and
the
wallpaper
she
looked
at
the
blood
because
it
was
suddenly
easier
to
look
at
that
than
at
them
in
a
small
voice
she
could
hardly
recognize
as
her
own
she
asked
do
you
see
it
do
any
of
you
see
it
is
it
there
ben
stepped
forward
and
she
was
again
struck
by
how
delicately
he
moved
for
such
a
fat
boy
he
touched
one
of
the
smears
of
blood
then
a
second
then
a
long
drip
on
the
mirror
here
here
here
his
voice
was
flat
and
authoritative
jeepers
it
looks
like
somebody
killed
a
pig
in
here
stan
said
softly
awed
tt
all
came
out
of
the
drain
eddie
asked
the
sight
of
the
blood
made
him
feel
ill
his
breath
was
shortening
he
clutched
at
his
aspirator
beverly
had
to
struggle
to
keep
from
bursting
into
fresh
tears
she
didn't
want
to
do
that
she
was
afraid
if
she
did
they
would
dismiss
her
as
just
another
girl
but
she
had
to
clutch
for
the
doorknob
as
relief
washed
through
her
in
a
wave
of
frightening
strength
until
that
moment
she
hadn't
realized
how
sure
she
was
that
she
was
going
crazy
having
hallucinations
something
and
your
mom
and
dad
never
saw
it
ben
marvelled
he
touched
a
splotch
of
blood
which
had
dried
on
the
basin
and
then
pulled
his
hand
away
and
wiped
it
on
the
tail
of
his
shirt
jeepers
creepers
don't
know
how
i
can
ever
come
in
here
agai
beverly
said
not
to
wash
up
or
brush
my
teeth
or
you
know
well
why
don't
we
clean
the
place
up
stanley
asked
suddenly
beverly
looked
at
him
clean
it
sure
maybe
we
couldn't
get
all
of
it
off
the
wallpaper
it
looks
sorta
you
know
on
its
last
legs
but
we
could
get
the
rest
haven't
you
got
some
rags
under
the
kitchen
sink
beverly
said
but
my
mom'll
wonder
where
they
went
if
we
use
them
tve
got
fifty
cents
stan
said
quietly
his
eyes
never
left
the
blood
that
had
spattered
the
area
of
the
bathroom
around
the
washbasin
we'll
clean
up
as
good
as
we
can
then
take
the
rags
down
to
that
coinop
laundry
place
back
the
way
we
came
we'll
wash
them
and
dry
them
and
they'll
all
be
back
under
the
sink
before
your
folks
get
home
my
mother
says
you
can't
get
blood
out
of
cloth
eddie
objected
she
says
it
sets
in
or
something
ben
uttered
a
hysterical
little
giggle
doesn't
matter
if
it
comes
out
of
the
rags
or
no
he
said
they
can't
see
it
no
one
had
to
ask
him
who
he
meant
by
they
all
right
beverly
said
let
try
it
for
the
next
half
hour
the
four
of
them
cleaned
like
grim
elves
and
as
the
blood
disappeared
from
the
walls
and
the
mirror
and
the
porcelain
basin
beverly
felt
her
heart
grow
lighter
and
lighter
ben
and
eddie
did
the
sink
and
mirror
while
she
scrubbed
the
floor
stan
worked
on
the
wallpaper
with
studious
care
using
a
rag
that
was
almost
dry
in
the
end
they
got
almost
all
of
it
ben
finished
by
removing
the
light
bulb
over
the
sink
and
replacing
it
with
one
from
the
box
of
bulbs
in
the
pantry
there
were
plenty
elfrida
marsh
had
bought
a
twoyear
supply
from
the
derry
lions
during
their
annual
lightbulb
sale
the
fall
before
they
used
elfrida
floorbucket
her
ajax
and
plenty
of
hot
water
they
dumped
the
water
frequently
because
none
of
them
liked
to
have
their
hands
in
it
once
it
had
turned
pink
at
last
stanley
backed
away
looked
at
the
bathroom
with
the
critical
eye
of
a
boy
in
whom
neatness
and
order
are
not
simply
ingrained
but
actually
innate
and
told
them
it
the
best
we
can
do
i
think
there
were
still
faint
traces
of
blood
on
the
wallpaper
to
the
left
of
the
sink
where
the
paper
was
so
thin
and
ragged
that
stanley
had
dared
do
no
more
than
blot
it
gently
yet
even
here
the
blood
had
been
sapped
of
its
former
ominous
strength
it
was
little
more
than
a
meaningless
pastel
smear
thank
you
beverly
said
to
all
€
them
she
could
not
remember
ever
having
meant
thanks
so
deeply
thank
you
all
tt
okay
ben
mumbled
he
was
of
course
blushing
again
sure
eddie
agreed
let
get
these
rags
don
stanley
said
his
face
was
set
almost
stern
and
later
beverly
would
think
that
perhaps
only
stan
realized
that
they
had
taken
another
step
toward
some
unthinkable
confrontation
they
measured
out
a
cup
of
mrs
marsh
tide
and
put
it
in
an
empty
mayonnaise
jar
bev
found
a
paper
shopping
bag
to
put
the
bloody
rags
in
and
the
four
of
them
went
down
to
the
kleenkloze
washateria
on
the
corner
of
main
and
cony
streets
two
blocks
farther
up
they
could
see
the
canal
gleaming
a
bright
blue
in
the
afternoon
sun
the
kleenkloze
was
empty
except
for
a
woman
in
a
white
nurse
uniform
who
was
waiting
for
her
dryer
to
stop
she
glanced
at
the
four
kids
distrustfully
and
then
went
back
to
her
paperback
of
peyton
place
cold
water
ben
said
in
a
low
voice
my
mom
says
you
gotta
wash
blood
in
cold
waer
they
dumped
the
rags
into
the
washer
while
stan
changed
his
two
quarters
for
four
dimes
and
two
nickels
he
came
back
and
watched
as
bev
dumped
the
tide
over
the
rags
and
swung
the
washer
door
closed
then
he
plugged
two
dimes
into
the
coinop
slot
and
twisted
the
start
knob
beverly
had
chipped
in
most
of
the
pennies
she
had
won
at
pitch
for
the
frappes
but
she
found
four
survivors
deep
down
in
the
lefthand
pocket
of
her
jeans
she
fished
them
out
and
offered
them
to
stan
who
looked
pained
jeez
he
said
i
take
a
girl
on
a
laundry
date
and
right
away
she
wants
to
go
dutch
beverly
laughed
a
little
you
sure
tm
sure
stan
said
in
his
dry
way
i
mean
it
really
breaking
my
heart
to
give
up
those
four
pence
beverly
but
i'm
sure
the
four
of
them
went
over
to
the
line
of
plastic
contour
chairs
against
the
washateria
cinderblock
wall
and
sat
there
not
talking
the
maytag
with
the
rags
in
it
chugged
and
sloshed
fans
of
suds
slobbered
against
the
thick
glass
of
its
round
porthole
at
first
the
suds
were
reddish
looking
at
them
made
bev
feel
a
little
sick
but
she
found
it
was
hard
to
look
away
the
bloody
foam
had
a
gruesome
sort
of
fascination
the
lady
in
the
nurse
uniform
glanced
at
them
more
and
more
often
over
the
top
of
her
book
she
had
perhaps
been
afraid
they
would
be
rowdy
now
their
very
silence
seemed
to
unnerve
her
when
her
dryer
stopped
she
took
her
clothes
out
folded
them
put
them
into
a
blue
plastic
laundrybag
and
left
giving
them
one
last
puzzled
look
as
she
went
out
the
door
as
soon
as
she
was
gone
ben
said
abruptly
almost
harshly
you're
not
alone
what
beverly
asked
you're
not
alone
ben
repeated
you
see
he
stopped
and
looked
at
eddie
who
nodded
he
looked
at
stan
who
looked
unhappy
but
who
after
a
moment
shrugged
and
also
nodded
what
in
the
world
are
you
talking
about
beverly
asked
she
was
tired
of
people
saying
inexplicable
things
to
her
today
she
gripped
ben
lower
arm
if
you
know
something
about
this
tell
me
do
you
want
to
do
it
ben
asked
eddie
eddie
shook
his
head
he
took
his
aspirator
out
of
his
pocket
and
sucked
in
on
it
with
a
monstrous
gasp
speaking
slowly
picking
his
words
ben
told
beverly
how
he
had
happened
to
meet
bill
denbrough
and
eddie
kaspbrak
in
the
barrens
on
the
day
school
let
out
that
was
almost
a
week
ago
as
hard
as
that
was
to
believe
he
told
her
about
how
they
had
built
the
dam
in
the
barrens
the
following
day
he
told
bill
story
of
how
the
school
photograph
of
his
dead
brother
had
turned
its
head
and
winked
he
told
his
own
story
of
the
mummy
who
had
walked
on
the
icy
canal
in
the
dead
heart
of
winter
with
balloons
that
floated
against
the
wind
beverly
listened
to
all
this
with
growing
horror
she
could
feel
her
eyes
widening
her
hands
and
feet
growing
cold
ben
stopped
and
looked
at
eddie
eddie
took
another
wheezing
pull
on
his
aspirator
and
then
told
the
story
of
the
leper
again
speaking
as
rapidly
as
ben
had
slowly
his
words
tumbling
over
one
another
in
their
urgency
to
escape
and
be
gone
he
finished
with
a
sucking
little
half
sob
but
this
time
he
didn't
cry
and
you
she
asked
looking
at
stan
unis
ee
there
was
sudden
silence
making
them
all
start
the
way
a
sudden
explosion
might
have
done
the
wash
is
don
stan
said
they
watched
him
get
up
small
economical
graceful
and
open
the
washer
he
pulled
out
the
rags
which
were
stuck
together
in
a
clump
and
examined
them
there
a
little
stain
lef
he
said
but
it
not
too
bad
looks
like
it
could
be
cranberry
juice
he
showed
them
and
they
all
nodded
gravely
as
if
over
important
documents
beverly
felt
a
relief
that
was
similar
to
the
relief
she
had
felt
when
the
bathroom
was
clean
again
she
could
stand
the
faded
pastel
smear
on
the
peeling
wallpaper
in
there
and
she
could
stand
the
faint
reddish
stain
on
her
mother
cleaning
rags
they
had
done
something
about
it
that
seemed
to
be
the
important
thing
maybe
it
hadn't
worked
completely
but
she
discovered
it
had
worked
well
enough
to
give
her
heart
peace
and
brother
that
was
good
enough
for
al
marsh
daughter
beverly
stan
tossed
them
into
one
of
the
barrelshaped
dryers
and
put
in
two
nickels
the
dryer
started
to
turn
and
stan
came
back
and
took
his
seat
between
eddie
and
ben
for
a
moment
the
four
of
them
sat
silent
again
watching
the
rags
turn
and
fall
turn
and
fall
the
drone
of
the
gasfired
dryer
was
soothing
almost
soporific
a
woman
passed
by
the
chockedopen
door
wheeling
a
cart
of
groceries
she
glanced
in
at
them
and
passed
on
i
did
see
something
stan
said
suddenly
i
didn't
want
to
talk
about
it
because
i
wanted
to
think
it
was
a
dream
or
something
maybe
even
a
fit
like
that
stavier
kid
has
any
you
guys
know
that
kid
ben
and
bev
shook
their
heads
eddie
said
the
kid
who
got
epilepsy
yeah
right
that
how
bad
it
was
i
would
have
rather
thought
i
had
something
like
that
than
that
i
saw
something
really
real
what
was
it
bev
asked
but
she
wasn't
sure
she
really
wanted
to
know
this
was
not
like
listening
to
ghoststories
around
a
campfire
while
you
ate
wieners
in
toasted
buns
and
cooked
marshmallows
over
the
flames
until
they
were
black
and
crinkly
here
hey
sat
in
this
stifling
laundromat
and
she
could
see
great
big
dust
kitties
under
the
washing
machines
ghostturds
her
father
called
them
she
could
see
dustmotes
dancing
in
the
hot
shafts
of
sunlight
which
fell
through
the
laundromat
dirty
plateglass
window
she
could
see
old
magazines
with
their
covers
torn
off
these
were
all
normal
things
nice
and
normal
and
boring
but
she
was
scared
terribly
scared
because
she
sensed
none
of
these
things
were
madeup
storks
madeup
monsters
ben
mummy
eddie
leper
either
or
both
of
them
might
be
out
tonight
when
the
sun
went
down
or
bill
denbrough
brother
onearmed
and
implacable
cruising
through
the
black
drains
under
the
city
with
silver
coins
for
eyes
yet
when
stan
did
not
answer
immediately
she
asked
again
what
was
it
speaking
carefully
stan
said
i
was
over
in
that
little
park
where
the
standpipe
is
oh
god
i
don't
like
that
place
eddie
said
dolefully
if
there
a
haunted
house
in
derry
that
it
what
stan
said
sharply
what
did
you
say
don't
you
know
about
that
plac
eddie
asked
my
mom
wouldn't
let
me
go
near
there
even
before
the
kids
started
getting
killed
she
she
takes
real
good
care
of
me
he
offered
them
an
uneasy
grin
and
held
his
aspirator
tighter
in
his
lap
you
see
some
kids
have
been
drowned
in
there
three
or
four
they
stan
stan
are
you
all
right
stan
uris
face
had
gone
a
leaden
gray
his
mouth
worked
soundlessly
his
eyes
rolled
up
until
the
others
could
only
see
the
bottommost
curves
of
his
irises
one
hand
clutched
weakly
at
empty
air
and
then
fell
against
his
thigh
eddie
did
the
only
thing
he
could
think
of
he
leaned
over
put
one
thin
arm
around
stan
slumping
shoulders
jammed
his
aspirator
into
stan
mouth
and
triggered
off
a
big
blast
stan
began
to
cough
and
choke
and
gag
he
sat
up
straight
his
eyes
back
in
focus
again
he
coughed
into
his
cupped
hands
at
last
he
uttered
a
huge
burping
gasp
and
slumped
back
against
his
chair
what
was
that
he
managed
at
last
my
asthma
medicine
eddie
said
apologetically
god
it
tastes
like
dead
dogshit
they
all
laughed
at
this
but
it
was
nervous
laughter
the
others
were
looking
nervously
at
stan
thin
color
now
burned
in
his
cheeks
it
pretty
bad
all
right
eddie
said
with
some
pride
yeah
but
is
it
kosher
stan
said
and
they
all
laughed
again
although
none
of
them
including
stan
really
knew
what
kosher
meant
stan
stopped
laughing
first
and
looked
at
eddie
intently
tell
me
what
you
know
about
the
standpip
he
said
eddie
started
but
both
ben
and
beverly
also
contributed
the
derry
standpipe
stood
on
kansas
street
about
a
mile
and
a
half
west
of
downtown
near
the
southern
edge
of
the
barrens
at
one
time
near
the
end
of
the
previous
century
it
had
supplied
all
of
derry
water
holding
one
and
threequarter
million
gallons
because
the
circular
openair
gallery
just
below
the
standpipe
roof
offered
a
spectacular
view
of
the
town
and
the
surrounding
countryside
it
had
been
a
popular
place
until
or
so
families
would
come
out
to
tiny
memorial
park
on
a
saturday
or
sunday
forenoon
when
the
weather
was
fine
climb
the
one
hundred
and
sixty
stairs
inside
the
standpipe
to
the
gallery
and
take
in
the
view
more
often
than
not
they
spread
and
ate
a
picnic
lunch
while
they
did
so
the
stairs
were
between
the
standpipe
outside
which
was
shingled
a
blinding
white
and
its
inner
sleeve
a
great
stainlesssteel
cylinder
standing
a
hundred
and
six
feet
high
these
stairs
wound
to
the
top
in
a
narrow
spiral
just
below
the
gallery
level
a
thick
wooden
door
in
the
standpipe
inner
jacket
gave
on
a
platform
over
the
water
itself
a
black
gently
lapping
tarn
lit
by
naked
magnesium
bulbs
screwed
into
reflective
tin
hoods
the
water
was
exactly
one
hundred
feet
deep
when
the
supply
was
all
the
way
up
where
did
the
water
come
from
ben
asked
bev
eddie
and
stan
looked
at
each
other
none
of
them
knew
well
what
about
the
kids
that
drowned
then
they
were
only
a
bit
clearer
on
that
it
seemed
that
in
those
days
‘olden
days
ben
called
them
solemnly
as
he
took
up
this
part
of
the
tale
the
door
leading
to
the
platform
over
the
water
had
always
been
left
unlocked
one
night
a
couple
of
kids
or
maybe
just
one
or
as
many
as
three
had
found
the
groundlevel
door
also
unlocked
they
had
gone
up
on
a
dare
they
found
their
way
out
onto
the
platform
over
the
water
instead
of
onto
the
gallery
by
mistake
in
the
darkness
they
had
fallen
over
the
edge
before
they
quite
knew
where
they
were
heard
it
from
this
kid
vic
crumly
who
said
he
heard
it
from
his
da
beverly
said
so
maybe
it
true
vie
said
his
dad
said
that
once
they
fell
into
the
water
they
were
as
good
as
dead
because
there
was
nothing
to
hold
onto
the
platform
was
just
out
of
reach
he
said
they
paddled
around
in
there
yelling
for
help
all
night
long
probably
only
no
one
heard
them
and
they
just
got
tireder
and
tireder
until
she
trailed
off
feeling
the
horror
of
it
sink
into
her
she
could
see
those
boys
in
her
mind
eye
real
or
madeup
paddling
around
like
drenched
puppies
going
under
coming
up
sputtering
splashing
more
and
swimming
less
as
panic
set
in
soggy
sneakers
treading
water
fingers
scrabbling
uselessly
for
any
kind
of
purchase
on
the
smooth
steel
walls
of
the
sleeve
she
could
taste
the
water
they
must
have
swallowed
she
could
hear
the
flat
echoing
quality
of
their
cries
how
long
fifteen
minutes
half
an
hour
how
long
before
the
cries
had
ceased
and
they
had
simply
floated
facedown
strange
fish
for
the
caretaker
to
find
the
next
morning
go
stan
said
dryly
i
heard
there
was
a
woman
who
lost
her
baby
too
eddie
said
suddenly
that
was
when
they
closed
the
place
for
good
at
least
that
what
i
heard
they
did
use
to
let
people
go
up
i
know
that
but
then
one
time
there
was
this
lady
and
her
baby
i
don't
know
how
old
the
baby
was
but
this
platform
it
supposed
to
go
right
out
over
the
water
and
the
lady
went
to
the
railing
and
she
was
you
know
holding
the
baby
and
either
she
dropped
it
or
maybe
it
just
wriggled
i
heard
this
guy
tried
to
save
it
doing
the
hero
bit
you
know
he
jumped
right
in
but
the
baby
was
gone
maybe
he
was
wearing
a
jacket
or
something
when
your
clothes
get
wet
they
drag
you
down
eddie
abruptly
put
his
hand
into
his
pocket
and
brought
out
a
small
brown
glass
bottle
he
opened
it
took
out
two
white
pills
and
swallowed
them
dry
what
were
those
beverly
asked
aspirin
i've
got
a
headache
he
looked
at
her
defensively
but
beverly
said
nothing
more
ben
finished
after
the
incident
of
the
baby
he
himself
he
said
had
heard
that
it
was
actually
a
kid
a
little
gjrl
of
about
three
the
town
council
had
voted
to
lock
the
standpipe
both
downstairs
and
up
and
stop
the
daytrips
and
picnics
on
the
gallery
it
had
remained
locked
from
then
until
now
oh
the
caretaker
came
and
went
and
the
maintenance
men
once
in
awhile
and
once
every
season
there
were
guided
tours
interested
citizens
could
follow
a
lady
from
the
historical
society
up
the
spiral
of
stairs
to
the
gallery
at
the
top
where
they
could
ooh
and
aah
over
the
view
and
snap
kodaks
to
show
their
friends
but
the
door
to
the
inner
sleeve
was
always
locked
now
ts
it
still
full
of
water
stan
asked
i
guess
so
ben
said
tve
seen
firetrucks
filling
up
there
during
grassfire
season
they
hook
a
hose
to
the
pipe
at
the
bottom
stanley
was
looking
at
the
dryer
again
watching
the
rags
go
around
and
mound
the
clump
had
broken
up
now
and
some
of
them
floated
like
parachutes
what
did
you
see
there
bev
asked
him
gently
for
a
moment
it
seemed
he
would
not
answer
at
all
then
he
drew
a
deep
shuddering
breath
and
said
something
that
at
first
struck
them
all
as
being
far
from
the
point
they
named
it
memorial
park
after
the
rd
maine
in
the
civil
war
the
derry
blues
they
were
called
there
used
to
be
a
statue
but
it
blew
down
during
a
storm
in
the
forties
they
didn't
have
money
enough
to
fix
the
statue
so
they
put
in
a
birdbath
instead
a
big
stone
birdbath
they
were
all
looking
at
him
stan
swallowed
there
was
an
audible
click
in
his
throat
i
watch
birds
you
see
i
have
an
album
a
par
of
zeissikon
binoculars
and
everything
he
looked
at
eddie
do
you
have
any
more
aspirins
eddie
handed
him
the
bottle
stan
took
two
hesitated
then
took
another
he
gave
the
bottle
back
and
swallowed
the
pills
one
after
another
grimacing
then
he
went
on
with
his
story
stan
encounter
had
happened
on
a
rainy
april
evening
two
months
ago
he
had
donned
his
slicker
put
his
birdbook
and
his
binoculars
in
a
waterproof
sack
with
a
drawstring
at
the
top
and
set
out
for
memorial
park
he
and
his
father
usually
went
out
together
but
his
father
had
had
to
work
ove
that
night
and
had
called
specially
at
suppertime
to
talk
to
stan
one
of
his
customers
at
the
agency
another
birdwatcher
had
spotted
what
he
believed
to
be
a
male
cardnal
fringillidae
richmondena
drinking
from
the
birdbath
in
memorial
park
he
told
stan
they
liked
to
eat
drink
and
bathe
right
around
dusk
it
was
very
rare
to
spot
a
cardinal
this
far
north
of
massachusetts
would
stan
like
to
go
down
there
and
see
if
he
could
collect
it
he
knew
the
weather
was
pretty
foul
but
stan
had
been
agreeable
his
mother
made
him
promise
to
keep
the
hood
of
his
slicker
up
but
stan
would
have
done
that
anyway
he
was
a
fastidious
boy
there
were
never
any
fights
about
getting
him
to
wear
his
rubbers
or
his
snowpants
in
the
winter
he
walked
the
mile
and
a
half
to
memorial
park
in
a
ram
so
fine
and
hesitant
that
it
really
wasn't
even
a
drizzle
it
was
more
like
a
constant
hanging
mist
the
air
was
muted
but
somehow
exciting
just
the
same
in
spite
of
the
last
dwindling
piles
of
snow
under
bushes
and
in
groves
of
trees
to
stan
they
looked
like
piles
of
dirty
castoff
pillowcases
there
was
a
smell
of
new
growth
in
the
air
looking
at
the
branches
of
elms
and
naples
and
oaks
against
the
leadwhite
sky
stan
thought
that
their
silhouettes
looked
mysteriously
thicker
they
would
burst
open
in
a
week
or
two
unrolling
leaves
of
a
delicate
almost
transparent
green
the
air
smells
green
tonight
he
thought
and
smiled
a
little
he
walked
quickly
because
the
light
would
be
gone
in
an
hour
or
even
less
he
was
as
fastidious
about
his
sightings
as
he
was
about
his
dress
and
study
habits
and
unless
there
was
enough
light
left
for
him
to
be
absolutely
sure
he
would
not
allow
himself
to
collect
the
cardinal
even
if
he
knew
in
his
heart
he
had
really
seen
it
he
cut
across
memorial
park
on
a
diagonal
the
standpipe
was
a
white
bulking
shape
to
his
left
stan
barely
glanced
at
it
he
had
no
interest
whatsoever
in
the
standpipe
memorial
park
was
a
rough
rectangle
which
sloped
downhill
the
grass
white
and
dead
at
this
time
of
year
was
kept
neatly
cut
in
the
summertime
and
there
were
circular
beds
of
flowers
there
was
no
playground
equipment
however
this
was
considered
a
grownup
park
at
the
far
end
the
grade
smoothed
out
before
dropping
abruptly
down
to
kansas
street
and
the
barrens
beyond
the
birdbath
his
father
had
mentioned
stood
on
this
flat
area
it
was
a
shallow
stone
dish
set
into
a
squat
masonry
pedestal
that
was
really
much
too
big
for
the
humble
function
it
fulfilled
stan
father
had
told
him
that
before
the
money
ran
out
they
had
intended
to
put
the
statue
of
the
soldier
back
up
here
again
i
like
the
birdbath
better
daddy
stan
said
mr
uris
ruffled
his
hair
me
too
son
he
said
more
baths
and
less
bullets
that
my
motto
at
the
top
of
this
pedestal
a
motto
had
been
carved
in
the
stone
stanley
read
it
but
did
not
understand
it
the
only
latin
he
understood
was
the
genus
classifications
of
the
birds
in
his
book
apparebat
eidolon
senex
pliny
the
inscription
read
stan
sat
down
on
a
bench
took
his
birdalbum
out
of
the
bag
and
turned
over
to
the
picture
of
the
cardinal
one
more
time
going
over
it
familiarizing
himself
with
the
recognizable
points
a
male
cardinal
would
be
hard
to
mistake
for
something
else
it
was
as
red
as
a
fireengine
if
not
so
large
but
stan
was
a
creature
of
habit
and
convention
these
things
comforted
him
and
reinforced
his
sense
of
place
and
belonging
in
the
world
so
he
gave
the
picture
a
good
threeminute
study
before
closing
the
book
the
moisture
in
the
air
was
making
the
comers
of
the
pages
turn
up
and
putting
it
back
into
the
bag
he
uncased
his
binoculars
and
put
them
to
his
eyes
there
was
no
need
to
adjust
the
field
of
focus
because
the
last
time
he
had
used
the
glasses
he
had
been
sitting
on
this
same
bench
and
looking
at
that
same
birdbath
fastidious
boy
patient
boy
he
did
not
fidget
he
did
not
get
up
and
walk
around
or
swing
the
binoculars
here
and
there
to
see
what
else
there
might
be
to
be
seen
he
sat
still
field
glasses
trained
on
the
birdbath
and
the
mist
collected
in
fat
drops
on
his
yellow
slicker
he
was
not
bored
he
was
looking
down
into
the
equivalent
of
an
avian
conventiorsite
four
brown
sparrows
sat
there
for
awhile
dipping
into
the
water
with
their
beaks
flicking
droplets
casually
back
over
their
shoulders
and
onto
their
backs
then
a
bluejay
came
hauling
in
like
a
cop
breaking
up
a
gaggle
of
loiterers
the
jay
was
as
big
as
a
house
in
stan
glasses
his
quarrelsome
cries
absurdly
thin
by
comparison
after
you
looked
through
the
binoculars
steadily
for
awhile
the
magnified
birds
you
saw
began
to
seem
not
odd
but
perfectly
correct
the
sparrows
flew
off
the
jay
now
in
charge
strutted
bathed
grew
bored
departed
the
sparrows
returned
then
flew
off
again
as
a
pair
of
robins
cruised
in
to
bathe
and
perhaps
to
discuss
matters
of
importance
to
the
hollowboned
set
stan
father
had
laughed
at
stan
hesitant
suggestion
that
maybe
birds
talked
and
he
was
sure
his
dad
was
right
when
he
said
birds
weren't
smart
enough
to
talk
that
their
brainpans
were
too
small
but
by
gosh
they
sure
looked
like
they
were
talking
a
new
bird
joined
them
it
was
red
stan
hastily
adjusted
the
field
of
focus
on
the
binoculars
a
bit
was
it
no
it
was
a
scarlet
tanager
a
good
bird
but
not
the
cardinal
he
was
looking
for
it
was
joined
by
a
flicker
that
was
a
frequent
visitor
to
the
memorial
park
birdbath
stan
recognized
him
by
the
tattered
right
wing
as
always
he
speculated
on
how
that
might
have
happened
a
close
call
with
some
cat
seemed
the
most
likely
explanation
other
birds
came
and
went
stan
saw
a
grackle
as
clumsy
and
ugly
as
a
flying
boxcar
a
bluebird
another
flicker
he
was
finally
rewarded
by
a
new
bird
not
the
cardinal
but
a
cowbird
that
looked
vast
and
stupid
in
the
eyepieces
of
the
binoculars
he
dropped
them
against
his
chest
and
fumbled
the
birdbook
out
of
the
bag
again
hoping
that
the
cowbird
wouldn't
fly
away
before
he
could
confirm
the
sighting
he
would
have
something
to
take
home
to
his
father
at
least
and
it
was
time
to
go
the
light
was
fading
fast
he
felt
cold
and
damp
he
checked
the
book
then
looked
through
the
glasses
again
it
was
still
there
not
bathing
but
only
standing
on
the
rim
of
the
birdbath
looking
dumb
it
was
almost
surely
a
cowbird
with
no
distinctive
markings
at
least
none
he
could
pick
up
at
this
distance
and
in
the
fading
light
it
was
hard
to
be
one
hundred
percent
sure
but
maybe
he
had
just
enough
time
and
light
for
one
more
check
he
looked
at
the
picture
in
the
book
studying
it
with
a
fierce
frown
of
concentration
and
then
picked
up
the
glasses
again
he
had
only
fixed
them
on
the
birdbath
when
a
hollow
rolling
boom
sent
the
cowbird
if
it
had
been
a
cowbird
winging
stan
tried
to
follow
it
with
the
glasses
knowing
how
slim
his
chances
were
of
picking
it
up
again
he
lost
it
and
made
a
hissing
sound
of
disgust
between
his
teeth
well
if
it
had
come
once
it
would
perhaps
come
again
and
it
had
only
been
a
cowbird
probably
a
cowbird
after
all
not
a
golden
eagle
or
a
great
auk
stan
recased
his
binoculars
and
put
away
his
birdalbum
then
he
got
up
and
boked
around
to
see
if
he
could
tell
what
had
been
responsible
for
that
sudden
loud
noise
it
hadn't
sounded
like
a
gun
or
a
car
backfire
more
like
a
door
being
thrown
open
in
a
spooky
movie
about
castles
and
dungeons
complete
with
hokey
echo
effects
he
could
see
nothing
he
got
up
and
started
toward
the
slope
down
to
kansas
street
the
standpipe
was
now
on
his
right
a
chalky
white
cylinder
phantomlike
in
the
mist
and
the
growing
darkness
it
seemed
almost
to
to
float
that
was
a
odd
thought
he
supposed
it
must
have
come
from
his
own
head
where
else
could
a
thought
come
from
but
it
somehow
did
not
seem
like
his
own
thought
at
all
he
looked
at
the
standpipe
more
closely
and
then
veered
in
that
direction
without
even
thinking
about
it
windows
circled
the
building
at
intervals
rising
around
it
in
a
spiral
that
made
stan
think
of
the
barber
pole
in
front
of
mr
aurlette
shop
where
he
and
his
dad
got
their
haircuts
the
bonewhite
shingles
bulged
out
over
each
of
those
dark
windows
like
brows
over
eyes
wonder
how
they
did
that
stan
thought
not
with
as
much
interest
as
ben
hanscom
would
have
felt
but
with
some
and
that
was
when
he
saw
there
was
a
much
larger
space
of
darkness
at
the
foot
of
the
standpipe
a
clear
oblong
in
the
circular
base
he
stopped
frowning
thinking
that
was
a
funny
place
for
a
window
it
was
completely
out
of
symmetry
with
the
others
then
he
realized
it
wasn't
a
window
it
was
a
door
the
noise
i
heard
he
thought
it
was
that
door
blowing
open
he
looked
around
early
gloomy
dusk
white
sky
now
fading
to
a
dull
dusky
purple
mist
thickening
a
bit
more
toward
the
steady
rain
which
would
fall
most
of
the
night
dusk
and
mist
and
no
wind
at
all
so
if
it
hadn't
blown
open
had
someone
pushed
it
open
why
and
it
looked
like
an
awfully
heavy
door
to
slam
open
hard
enough
to
make
a
noise
like
that
boom
he
supposed
a
very
big
person
maybe
curious
stan
walked
over
for
a
closer
look
the
door
was
bigger
than
he
had
first
supposed
six
feet
high
and
two
feet
thick
the
boards
which
composed
it
bound
with
brass
strips
stan
swung
it
halfclosed
it
moved
smoothly
and
easily
on
its
hinges
in
spite
of
its
size
it
also
moved
silently
there
was
not
a
singe
squeak
he
had
moved
it
to
see
how
much
damage
it
had
done
to
the
shingles
blasting
open
like
that
there
was
no
damage
at
all
not
so
much
as
a
single
mark
weirdsville
as
richie
would
say
well
it
wasn't
the
door
you
heard
that
all
he
thought
maybe
a
jet
from
loring
boomed
over
derry
or
something
door
was
probably
open
all
al
his
foot
struck
something
stan
looked
down
and
saw
it
was
a
padlock
correction
it
was
the
remains
of
a
padlock
it
had
been
burst
wide
open
it
looked
in
fact
as
if
someone
had
rammed
the
lock
keyway
full
of
gunpowder
and
then
set
a
match
to
it
flowers
of
metal
deadly
sharp
stood
out
from
the
body
of
the
lock
in
a
stiff
spray
stan
could
see
the
layers
of
steel
inside
the
thick
hasp
hung
askew
by
one
bolt
which
had
been
yanked
three
uarters
of
the
way
out
of
the
wood
the
other
three
haspbolts
lay
on
the
wet
grass
they
had
been
twisted
like
pretzels
frowning
stan
swung
the
door
open
again
and
peered
inside
narrow
stairs
led
upward
circling
around
and
out
of
sight
the
outer
wall
of
the
staircase
was
bare
wood
supported
by
giant
crossbeams
which
had
been
pegged
together
rather
than
nailed
to
stan
some
of
the
pegs
looked
thicker
than
his
own
upper
arm
the
inner
wall
was
steel
from
which
gigantic
rivets
swelled
like
boils
is
anyone
here
stan
asked
there
was
no
answer
he
hesitated
then
stepped
inside
so
he
could
see
up
the
narrow
throat
of
the
staircase
a
little
better
nothing
and
it
was
creep
city
in
here
as
richie
would
also
say
he
turned
to
leave
and
heard
music
it
was
faint
but
still
instantly
recognizable
calliope
music
he
cocked
his
head
listening
the
frown
on
his
face
starting
to
dissolve
a
little
calliope
music
all
right
the
music
of
carnivals
and
county
fairs
it
conjured
up
trace
memories
which
were
as
delightful
as
they
were
ephemeral
popcorn
cotton
candy
doughboys
frying
in
hot
grease
the
chain
driven
clatter
of
rides
like
the
wild
mouse
the
whip
the
koaster
kups
now
the
frown
had
become
a
tentative
grin
stan
went
up
one
step
then
two
more
head
still
cocked
he
paused
again
as
if
thinking
about
carnivals
could
actually
create
one
he
could
now
actually
smell
the
popcorn
the
cotton
candy
the
doughboys
and
more
peppers
chilidogs
cigarette
smoke
and
sawdust
there
was
the
sharp
smell
of
white
vinegar
the
kind
you
could
shake
over
your
french
fries
through
a
hole
in
the
tin
cap
he
could
smell
mustard
bright
yellow
and
stinging
hot
that
you
spread
on
your
hotdog
with
a
wooden
paddle
this
was
amazing
incredible
irresistible
he
took
another
step
up
and
that
was
when
he
heard
the
rustling
eager
footsteps
above
him
descending
the
stairs
he
cocked
his
head
again
the
calliope
music
had
gotten
suddenly
louder
as
if
to
mask
the
sound
of
the
footsteps
he
could
recognize
the
tune
now
it
was
camptown
races
footsteps
yeah
but
they
weren't
exactly
rustling
footsteps
were
they
they
actually
sounded
kind
of
squishy
didn't
hey
the
sound
was
like
people
walking
in
rubbers
full
of
water
camptown
ladies
sing
dis
song
doodah
doodah
squishsquish
camptown
racetrack
nine
miles
long
doodah
doodah
squishslosh
closer
now
ride
around
all
night
ride
around
all
day
now
there
were
shadows
bobbing
on
the
wall
above
him
the
terror
leaped
down
stan
throat
all
at
once
it
was
like
swallowing
something
hot
and
horrible
bad
medicine
that
suddenly
galvanized
you
like
electricity
it
was
the
shadows
that
did
it
he
saw
them
only
for
a
moment
he
had
just
that
small
bit
of
time
to
observe
that
there
were
two
of
them
that
they
were
slumped
and
somehow
unnatural
he
had
only
that
moment
because
the
light
in
here
was
fading
fading
too
fast
and
as
he
turned
the
heavy
standpipe
door
swung
ponderously
shut
behind
him
stanley
ran
back
down
the
stairs
somehow
he
had
climbed
more
than
a
dozen
although
he
could
only
remember
climbing
two
three
at
most
very
much
afraid
now
it
was
too
dark
in
here
to
see
anything
he
could
hear
his
own
breathing
he
could
hear
die
calliope
tootling
away
somewhere
above
him
what
a
calliope
doing
up
there
in
the
dark
who
playing
it
and
he
could
hear
those
wet
footsteps
approaching
him
now
getting
closer
he
hit
the
door
with
his
hands
splayed
out
in
front
of
him
hit
it
hard
enough
to
send
sparkly
tingles
of
pain
all
the
way
up
to
his
elbows
it
had
swung
so
easily
before
and
now
it
would
not
move
at
all
no
that
was
not
quite
true
at
first
it
ad
moved
just
a
bit
just
enough
for
him
to
see
a
mocking
strip
of
gray
light
running
vertically
down
its
left
side
then
gone
again
as
if
someone
was
on
the
other
side
of
it
holding
the
door
closed
panting
terrified
stan
pushed
against
the
door
wth
all
of
his
strength
he
could
feel
the
brass
bindings
digging
into
his
hands
nothing
he
whirled
around
now
pressing
his
back
and
his
splayed
hands
against
the
door
he
could
feel
sweat
oily
and
hot
running
down
his
forehead
the
calliope
music
had
gotten
louder
yet
it
drifted
and
echoed
down
the
spiral
staircase
there
was
nothing
cheery
about
it
now
it
had
changed
it
had
become
a
dirge
it
screamed
like
wind
and
water
and
in
his
mind
eye
stan
saw
a
county
fair
at
the
end
of
autumn
wind
and
rain
blowing
up
a
deserted
midway
pennons
flapping
tents
bulging
falling
over
wheeling
away
like
canvas
bats
he
saw
empty
rides
standing
against
the
sky
like
scaffolds
the
wind
drummed
and
hooted
in
the
weird
angles
of
their
struts
he
suddenly
understood
that
death
was
in
this
place
with
him
that
death
was
coming
for
him
out
of
the
dark
and
he
could
not
run
a
sudden
rush
of
water
spilled
down
the
stairs
now
it
was
not
popcorn
and
doughboys
and
cotton
candy
he
smelled
but
wet
decay
the
stench
of
dead
pork
which
has
exploded
in
a
fury
of
maggots
in
a
place
hidden
away
from
the
sun
who
here
'he
screamed
in
a
high
trembling
voice
he
was
answered
by
a
low
bubbling
voice
that
seemed
choked
with
mud
and
old
water
the
dead
ones
stanley
we're
the
dead
ones
we
sank
but
now
we
float
and
you'll
float
too
he
could
feel
water
washing
around
his
feet
he
cringed
back
against
the
door
in
an
agony
of
fear
they
were
very
close
now
he
could
feel
their
nearness
he
could
smell
them
something
was
digging
into
his
hip
as
he
struck
the
door
again
and
again
in
a
mindless
useless
effort
to
get
away
we're
dead
but
sometimes
we
clown
around
a
little
stanley
sometimes
we
it
was
his
birdbook
without
thinking
stan
grabbed
for
it
it
was
stuck
in
his
slicker
pocket
and
wouldn't
come
out
one
of
them
was
down
now
he
could
hear
it
shuffling
across
the
little
stone
areaway
where
he
had
come
in
it
would
reach
for
him
in
a
moment
and
he
would
feel
its
cold
flesh
he
gave
one
more
tremendous
yank
and
the
birdbook
was
in
his
hands
he
held
it
in
front
of
him
like
a
puny
shield
not
thinking
of
what
he
was
doing
but
suddenly
sure
that
this
was
right
robins
he
screamed
into
the
darkness
and
for
a
moment
the
thing
approaching
it
was
surely
less
than
five
steps
away
now
hesitated
he
was
almost
sure
it
did
and
for
a
moment
hadn't
he
felt
some
give
in
the
door
against
which
he
was
now
cringing
but
he
wasn't
cringing
anymore
he
was
standing
up
straight
in
the
darkness
when
had
that
happened
no
time
to
wonder
stan
licked
his
dry
lips
and
began
to
chant
robins
gray
egrets
loons
scarlet
tanagers
crackles
hammerhead
woodpeckers
redheaded
woodpeckers
chickadees
wrens
peli
the
door
opened
with
a
protesting
scream
and
stan
took
a
giant
step
backward
into
thin
misty
air
he
fell
sprawling
on
the
dead
grass
he
had
bent
the
birdbook
nearly
in
half
and
later
that
night
he
would
see
the
clear
impressions
of
his
fingers
sunken
into
its
cover
as
if
it
had
been
bound
in
playdoh
instead
of
hard
pressboard
he
didn't
try
to
get
up
but
began
to
dig
in
with
his
heels
instead
his
butt
grooving
through
the
slick
grass
his
lips
were
pulled
back
over
his
teeth
inside
that
dim
oblong
łe
could
see
two
sets
of
legs
below
the
diagonal
shadowline
thrown
by
the
door
which
now
stood
half
open
he
could
see
jeans
that
had
decayed
to
a
purplishblack
orange
threads
lay
plastered
limply
against
the
seams
and
water
dripped
from
the
cuffs
to
puddle
around
shoes
that
had
mostly
rotted
away
revealing
swelled
purple
toes
within
their
hands
lay
limply
at
their
sides
too
long
too
waxywhite
depending
from
each
finger
was
a
small
orange
pompom
holding
his
bent
birdbook
in
front
of
him
his
face
wet
with
drizzle
sweat
and
tears
stan
whispered
in
a
husky
monotone
chickenhawks
grosbeaks
hummingbirds
albatrosses
kiwis

one
of
those
hands
turned
over
showing
a
palm
from
which
endless
water
had
eroded
all
the
lines
leaving
something
as
idiotsmooth
as
the
hand
of
a
departmentstore
dummy
one
finger
unrolled
then
rolled
up
again
the
pompom
bounced
and
dangled
dangled
and
bounced
it
was
beckoning
him
stan
uris
who
would
die
in
a
lathtub
with
crosses
slashed
into
his
forearms
twentyseven
years
later
got
to
his
knees
then
to
his
feet
then
ran
he
ran
across
kansas
street
without
looking
either
way
for
traffic
and
paused
panting
on
the
far
sidewalk
to
look
back
from
this
angle
he
couldn't
see
the
door
in
the
base
of
the
standpipe
only
the
standpipe
itself
thick
and
yet
somehow
graceful
standing
in
the
murk
they
were
dead
stan
whispered
to
himself
shocked
he
wheeled
suddenly
and
ran
for
home
the
dryer
had
stopped
so
had
stan
the
three
others
only
looked
at
him
for
a
long
moment
his
skin
was
nearly
as
gray
as
the
april
evening
of
which
he
had
just
told
them
wow
ben
said
at
last
he
let
out
his
breath
in
a
ragged
whistling
sigh
tt
true
stan
said
in
a
low
voice
i
swear
to
god
it
is
i
believe
.yo
beverly
said
after
what
happened
at
my
house
i'd
believe
anything
she
got
up
suddenly
almost
knocking
over
her
chair
and
went
to
the
dryer
she
began
to
pull
out
the
rags
one
by
one
folding
them
her
back
was
turned
but
ben
suspected
she
was
crying
he
wanted
to
go
to
her
and
lacked
the
courage
we
gotta
talk
to
bill
about
this
eddie
said
bill
will
know
what
to
do
do
stan
said
turning
to
look
at
him
what
do
you
mean
do
eddie
looked
at
him
uncomfortable
well
i
don't
want
to
do
anything
stan
said
he
was
looking
at
eddie
with
such
a
hard
fierce
stare
that
eddie
squirmed
in
his
chair
i
want
to
forget
about
it
that
all
i
want
to
do
not
that
easy
beverly
said
quietly
turning
around
ben
had
been
right
the
hot
sunlight
slanting
in
through
the
washateria
dirty
windows
reflected
off
bright
lines
of
tears
on
her
cheeks
it
not
just
us
i
heard
ronnie
grogan
and
the
little
boy
i
heard
first
i
think
maybe
it
was
that
little
clements
kid
the
one
who
disappeared
off
his
trike
so
what
stan
said
defiantly
so
what
if
it
gets
more
she
asked
what
if
it
gets
more
kids
his
eyes
a
hot
brown
locked
with
her
blue
ones
answering
the
question
without
speaking
so
what
if
it
does
but
beverly
did
not
look
down
or
away
and
at
last
stan
dropped
his
own
eyes
perhaps
only
because
she
was
still
crying
but
perhaps
because
her
concern
somehow
made
her
stronger
eddie
righ
she
said
we
ought
to
talk
to
bill
then
maybe
to
the
police
chief
right
stan
said
if
he
was
trying
to
sound
contemptuous
it
didn't
work
his
voice
came
out
sounding
only
tired
dead
kids
in
the
standpipe
blood
that
only
kids
can
see
not
grownups
clowns
walking
on
the
canal
balloons
that
blow
against
the
wind
mummies
lepers
under
porches
chief
borton'll
laugh
his
bum
off
and
then
stick
us
in
the
loonybin
if
we
all
went
to
hi
ben
said
troubled
if
we
all
went
together
sure
stan
said
right
tell
me
more
haystack
write
me
a
book
he
got
up
and
went
to
the
window
hands
in
pockets
looking
angry
and
upset
and
scared
he
stared
out
for
a
moment
shoulders
stiff
and
rejecting
beneath
his
neat
shirt
without
turning
back
to
them
he
repeated
write
me
a
frigging
book
no
ben
said
quietly
bill
going
to
write
the
books
stan
wheeled
back
surprised
and
the
others
looked
at
him
there
was
a
shocked
look
on
ben
hanscom
face
as
if
he
had
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
slapped
himself
bev
folded
the
last
of
the
rags
bird
eddie
said
what
bev
and
ben
said
together
eddie
was
looking
at
stan
you
got
out
by
yelling
bird
names
at
them
maybe
stan
said
reluctantly
or
maybe
the
door
was
just
stuck
and
finally
popped
open
without
you
leaning
on
it
bev
asked
stan
shrugged
it
was
not
a
sullen
shrug
it
only
said
he
didn't
know
i
think
it
was
the
birds
you
shouted
at
them
eddie
said
but
why
in
the
movies
you
hold
up
across
or
say
the
lord
prayer
ben
added
or
the
twentythird
psal
beverly
put
in
i
know
the
twentythird
psalm
stan
said
angrily
but
i
wouldn't
do
so
good
with
the
old
crucifix
business
i'm
jewish
remember
they
looked
away
from
him
embarrassed
either
for
his
having
been
born
that
way
or
for
their
having
forgotten
it
birds
eddie
said
again
jesus
then
he
glanced
guiltily
at
stan
again
but
stan
was
looking
moodily
across
the
street
at
the
bangor
hydro
office
bill
will
know
what
to
do
ben
said
suddenly
as
if
finally
agreeing
with
bev
and
eddie
betcha
anything
betcha
any
amount
of
money
look
stan
said
looking
at
all
of
them
earnestly
that
okay
we
can
talk
to
bill
about
it
if
you
want
but
that
where
things
stop
for
me
you
can
call
me
a
chicken
or
yellow
i
don't
care
i'm
not
a
chicken
i
don't
think
it
just
that
those
things
in
the
standpipe
if
you
weren't
afraid
of
something
like
that
you'd
have
to
be
crazy
stan
beverly
said
softly
yeah
i
was
scared
but
that
not
the
problem
stan
said
hotly
it
not
even
what
i'm
talking
about
don't
you
see
they
were
looking
at
him
expectantly
their
eyes
both
troubled
and
faintly
hopeful
but
stan
found
he
could
not
explain
how
he
felt
the
words
had
run
out
there
was
a
brick
of
feeling
inside
him
almost
choking
him
and
he
could
not
get
it
out
of
his
throat
neat
as
he
was
sure
as
he
was
he
was
still
only
an
eleven
yearold
boy
who
had
that
year
finished
the
fourth
grade
he
wanted
to
tell
them
that
there
were
worse
things
than
being
frightened
you
could
be
frightened
by
things
like
almost
having
a
car
hit
you
while
you
were
riding
your
bike
or
before
the
salk
vaccine
getting
polio
you
could
be
frightened
of
that
crazyman
khrushchev
or
of
drowning
if
you
went
out
over
your
head
you
could
be
frightened
of
all
those
things
and
still
function
but
those
things
in
the
standpipe
he
wanted
to
tell
them
that
those
dead
boys
who
had
lurched
and
shambled
their
way
down
the
spiral
staircase
had
done
something
worse
than
frighten
him
they
had
offended
him
offended
yes
it
was
the
only
word
he
could
think
of
and
if
he
used
it
they
would
laugh
they
liked
him
he
knew
that
and
they
had
accepted
him
as
one
of
them
but
they
would
still
laugh
all
the
same
there
were
things
that
were
not
supposed
to
be
they
offended
any
sane
person
sense
of
order
they
offended
the
central
idea
that
god
had
given
the
earth
a
final
tilt
on
its
axis
so
that
twilight
would
only
last
about
twelve
minutes
at
the
equator
and
linger
for
an
hour
or
more
up
where
the
eskimos
built
their
icecube
houses
that
he
had
done
that
and
he
then
had
said
in
effect
okay
if
you
can
figure
out
the
tilt
you
can
figure
out
any
damn
thing
you
choose
because
even
light
has
weight
and
when
the
note
of
a
trainwhistle
suddenly
drops
it
the
doppler
effect
and
when
an
airplane
breaks
the
sound
barrier
that
bang
isn't
the
applause
of
the
angels
or
the
flatulence
of
demons
but
only
air
collapsing
back
into
place
i
gave
you
the
tilt
and
then
i
sat
back
about
halfway
up
the
auditorium
to
watch
the
show
i
got
nothing
else
to
say
except
that
two
and
two
makes
four
the
lights
in
the
sky
are
stars
if
there
blood
grownups
can
see
it
as
well
as
kids
and
dead
boys
stay
dead
you
can
live
with
fear
i
think
stan
would
have
said
if
he
could
maybe
not
forever
but
for
a
long
long
time
its
offense
you
maybe
can't
live
with
because
it
opens
up
a
crack
inside
your
thinking
and
if
you
look
down
into
it
you
see
there
are
live
things
down
there
and
they
have
little
yellow
eyes
that
don't
blink
and
there
a
stink
down
in
that
dark
and
after
awhile
you
think
maybe
there
a
whole
other
universe
down
there
a
universe
where
a
square
moon
rises
in
the
sky
and
the
stars
laugh
in
cold
voices
and
some
of
the
triangles
have
four
sides
and
some
have
five
and
some
of
them
have
five
raised
to
the
fifth
power
of
sides
in
this
universe
there
might
grow
roses
which
sing
everything
leads
to
everything
he
would
have
told
them
if
he
could
go
to
your
church
and
listen
to
your
stories
about
jesus
walking
on
the
water
but
if
i
saw
a
guy
doing
that
i'd
scream
and
scream
and
scream
because
it
wouldn't
look
like
a
miracle
to
me
it
would
look
like
an
offense
because
he
could
say
none
of
these
things
he
just
reiterated
being
scared
isn't
the
problem
i
just
don't
want
to
be
involved
in
something
that
will
land
me
in
the
nuthatch
will
you
at
least
go
with
us
to
talk
to
him
bev
asked
listen
to
what
he
says
sure
stan
said
and
then
laughed
maybe
i
ought
to
bring
my
birdbook
they
all
laughed
then
and
it
was
a
little
easier
beverly
left
them
outside
the
kleenkloze
and
took
the
rags
back
home
by
herself
the
apartment
was
still
empty
she
put
them
under
the
kitchen
sink
and
closed
the
cupboard
she
stood
up
and
looked
down
toward
the
bathroom
i'm
not
going
down
there
she
thought
i'm
going
to
watch
bandstand
on
tv
see
if
i
can't
learn
how
to
do
the
dog
so
she
went
into
the
living
room
and
turned
on
the
tv
and
five
minutes
later
she
turned
it
off
while
dick
clark
was
showing
how
much
oil
just
one
stridex
medicated
pad
could
take
off
the
face
of
your
average
teenager
if
you
think
you
can
get
clean
with
just
soap
and
water
dick
said
holding
the
dirty
pad
up
to
the
glassy
eye
of
the
camera
so
that
every
teenager
in
america
could
get
a
good
look
you
ought
to
take
a
good
look
at
this.’
she
went
back
to
the
kitchen
cupboard
over
the
sink
where
her
father
kept
his
tools
among
them
was
a
pocket
tape
the
kind
that
runs
out
a
long
yellow
tongue
of
inches
she
folded
this
into
one
cold
hand
and
went
down
to
the
bathroom
it
was
sparkling
clean
silent
somewhere
far
distant
it
seemed
she
could
hear
mrs
doyon
yelling
for
her
boy
jim
to
get
in
out
of
the
road
right
now
she
went
to
the
bathroom
basin
and
looked
down
into
the
dark
eye
of
the
drain
she
stood
there
for
some
time
her
legs
as
cold
as
marble
inside
her
jeans
her
nipples
feeling
sharp
enough
and
hard
enough
to
cut
paper
her
lips
dead
dry
she
waited
for
the
voices
no
voices
came
a
little
shuddery
sigh
came
from
her
and
she
began
to
feed
the
thin
steel
tape
into
the
drain
it
went
down
smoothly
like
a
sword
into
the
gullet
of
a
county
fair
sideshow
performer
six
inches
eight
inches
ten
it
stopped
bound
up
in
the
elbowbend
under
the
sink
beverly
supposed
she
wiggled
it
pushing
gently
at
the
same
time
and
eventually
the
tape
began
to
feed
into
the
drain
again
sixteen
inches
now
then
two
feet
then
three
she
watched
the
yellow
tape
slipping
out
of
the
chromedsteel
case
which
had
been
worn
black
on
the
sides
ty
her
father
big
hand
in
her
mind
eye
she
saw
it
sliding
through
the
black
bore
of
the
pipe
picking
up
some
muck
scraping
away
flakes
of
rust
down
there
where
the
sun
never
shines
and
the
night
never
stops
she
thought
she
imagined
the
head
of
the
tape
with
its
small
steel
buttplate
no
bigger
than
a
fingernail
sliding
farther
and
farther
into
the
darkness
and
part
of
her
mind
screamed
what
are
you
doing
she
did
not
ignore
that
voice
but
she
seemed
helpless
to
heed
it
she
saw
the
end
of
the
tape
going
straight
down
now
descending
into
the
cellar
she
saw
it
striking
the
sewage
pipe
and
even
as
she
saw
it
the
tape
bound
up
again
she
wiggled
it
again
and
the
tape
thin
enough
to
be
limber
made
a
faint
eerie
sound
that
remmnded
her
a
little
bit
of
the
way
a
saw
sounds
when
you
bend
it
back
and
forth
across
your
legs
she
could
see
its
tip
wiggling
against
the
bottom
of
this
wider
pipe
which
would
have
a
baked
ceramic
surface
she
could
see
it
bending
and
then
she
was
able
to
push
it
forward
again
she
ran
out
six
feet
seven
nine
and
suddenly
the
tape
began
to
run
through
her
hands
by
itself
as
if
something
down
there
was
pulling
the
other
end
not
just
pulling
it
running
with
it
she
stared
at
the
flowing
tape
her
eyes
wide
her
mouth
a
sagging
o
of
fear
fear
yes
but
no
surprise
hadn't
she
known
hadn't
she
known
something
like
this
was
going
to
happen
the
tape
ran
out
to
its
final
stop
eighteen
feet
an
even
six
yards
a
soft
chuckle
came
wafting
out
of
the
drain
followed
by
a
low
whisper
that
was
almost
reproachful
beverly
beverly
beverly

can't
fight
us
you'll

you

you
try

beverly
beverly
lylyly
something
clicked
inside
the
tapemeasure
housing
and
it
suddenly
began
to
run
rapidly
back
into
its
case
the
numbers
and
hashmarks
blurring
by
near
the
end
the
last
five
or
six
feet
the
yellow
became
a
dark
dripping
red
and
she
screamed
and
dropped
it
on
the
floor
as
if
the
tape
had
suddenly
turned
into
a
live
snake
fresh
blood
trickled
over
the
clean
white
porcelain
of
the
basin
and
back
down
into
the
drain
wide
eye
she
bent
sobbing
now
her
fear
a
freezing
weight
in
her
stomach
and
picked
the
tape
up
she
tweezed
it
between
the
thumb
and
first
finger
of
her
right
hand
and
holding
it
in
front
of
her
took
it
into
the
kitchen
as
she
walked
blood
dripped
from
the
tape
onto
the
faded
linoleum
of
the
hall
and
the
kitchen
she
steadied
herself
by
thinking
of
what
her
father
would
say
to
her
what
he
would
do
to
her
if
he
found
that
she
had
gotten
his
measuring
tape
all
bloody
of
course
he
wouldn't
be
able
to
see
the
blood
but
it
helped
to
think
that
she
took
one
of
the
clean
rags
still
as
warm
as
fresh
bread
from
the
dryer
and
went
back
into
the
bathroom
before
she
began
to
clean
she
put
the
hard
rubber
plug
in
the
drain
closing
that
eye
the
blood
was
fresh
and
it
cleaned
up
easily
she
went
up
her
own
trail
wiping
away
the
dunesized
drops
on
the
linoleum
then
rinsing
the
rag
wringing
it
out
and
putting
it
aside
she
got
a
second
rag
and
used
it
to
clean
her
father
measuring
tape
the
blood
was
thick
viscous
in
two
places
there
were
clots
of
the
stuff
black
and
spongy
although
the
blood
only
went
back
five
or
six
feet
she
cleaned
the
entire
length
of
the
tape
removing
from
it
all
traces
of
pipemuck
that
done
she
put
it
back
into
the
cupboard
over
the
sink
and
took
the
two
stained
rags
out
in
back
of
the
apartment
mrs
doyon
was
yelling
at
jim
again
her
voice
was
clear
almost
bell
like
in
the
still
hot
late
afternoon
in
the
back
yard
which
was
mostly
bare
din
weeds
and
clotheslines
there
was
a
rusty
incinerator
beverly
threw
the
rags
into
it
then
sat
down
on
the
back
steps
tears
came
suddenly
with
surprising
violence
and
this
time
she
made
no
effort
to
hold
them
back
she
put
her
arms
on
her
knees
her
head
in
her
arms
and
wept
while
mrs
doyon
called
for
jim
to
come
out
of
that
road
did
he
want
to
get
hit
by
a
car
and
be
killed

two

disappearances
in
the
past
week
both
children
just
as
i
was
beginning
to
relax
one
of
them
a
sixteenyearold
boy
named
dennis
torrio
the
other
a
girl
of
just
five
who
was
out
sledding
in
back
of
her
house
on
west
broadway
the
hysterical
mother
found
her
sled
one
of
those
blue
plastic
flying
saucers
but
nothing
else
there
had
been
a
fresh
fall
of
snow
the
night
before
four
inches
or
so
no
tracks
but
hers
chief
rademacher
said
when
i
called
him
he
is
becoming
extremely
amoyed
with
me
i
think
not
anything
that
going
to
keep
me
awake
nights
i
have
worse
things
to
do
than
that
don't
i
asked
him
if
i
could
see
the
police
photos
he
refused
asked
him
if
her
tracks
led
away
toward
any
sort
of
drain
or
sewer
grating
this
was
followed
by
a
long
period
of
silence
then
rademacher
said
tm
beginning
to
wonder
if
maybe
you
shouldn't
see
a
doctor
hanlon
the
headpeeper
kind
of
doctor
the
kid
was
snatched
by
her
father
don't
you
read
the
papers
was
the
torrio
boy
snatched
by
his
father
i
asked
another
long
pause
give
it
a
rest
hanlon
he
said
give
me
a
rest
he
hung
up
of
course
i
read
the
papers
don't
i
put
them
out
in
the
reading
room
of
the

each

mysef
the
little
girl
laurie
ann
winterbarger
had
been
in
the
custody
of
her
mother
following
an
acrimonious
divorce
proceeding
in
the
spring
of
the
police
are
operating
on
the
theory
that
horst
winterbarger
who
is
supposedly
working
as
a
machinery
maintenance
man
somewhere
in
florida
drove
up
to
maine
to
snatch
his
daughter
they
further
theorize
that
he
parked
his
car
beside
the
house
and
called
to
his
daughter
who
then
joined
him
hence
the
lack
of
any
tracks
other
than
the
little
girl
they
have
less
to
say
about
the
fact
that
the
girl
had
not
seen
her
father
since
she
was
two
part
of
the
deep
bitterness
which
accompanied
the
winterbarger
divorce
came
from
mrs
winterbarger
allegations
that
on
at
least
two
occasions
horst
winterbarger
had
sexually
molested
the
child
she
asked
the
court
to
deny
winterbarger
all
visitation
rights
a
request
the
court
granted
in
spite
of
winterbarger
hot
denials
rademacher
claims
the
court
decision
which
had
the
effect
of
cutting
winterbarger
off
compktely
from
his
only
child
may
have
pushed
winterbarger
into
taking
his
daughter
that
at
least
has
some
dun
plausibility
but
ask
yourself
this
would
little
laurie
ann
have
recognized
him
after
three
years
and
run
to
him
when
he
called
her
rademacher
says
yes
even
though
she
was
two
the
last
time
she
saw
him
i
don't
think
so
and
her
mother
says
laurie
ann
had
been
well
trained
about
not
approaching
or
talking
to
strangers
a
lesson
most
derry
children
learn
early
and
well
rademacher
says
he
got
florida
state
police
looking
for
winterbarger
and
that
his
responsibility
ends
there
matters
of
custody
are
more
the
province
of
the
lawyers
than
that
of
the
police
this
pompous
overweight
asshole
is
quoted
as
saying
in
last
friday
derry
news
but
the
torrio
boy
that
something
else
wonderful
home
life
played
football
for
the
derry
tigers
honor
roll
student
had
gone
through
the
outward
bound
survival
school
in
the
summer
of
and
passed
with
flying
colors
no
history
of
drug
use
had
a
girlfriend
that
he
was
apparently
headoverheels
about
had
everything
to
live
for
everything
to
stay
in
derry
for
at
least
for
the
next
couple
of
years
all
the
same
he
gone
what
happened
to
him
a
sudden
attack
of
wanderlust
a
drunk
diver
who
maybe
hit
him
killed
him
and
buried
him
or
is
he
maybe
still
in
derry
is
he
maybe
on
the
nightside
of
derry
keeping
company
with
folks
like
betty
ripsom
and
patrick
hockstetter
and
eddie
corcoran
and
all
the
rest
is
it
later
i'm
doing
it
again
going
over
and
over
the
same
ground
doing
nothing
constructive
only
cranking
myself
up
to
the
screaming
point
i
jump
when
the
iron
stairs
leading
up
to
the
stacks
creak
i
jump
at
shadows
i
find
myself
wondering
how
i'd
react
if
i
was
shelving
books
up
therein
the
stacks
pushing
my
little
rubberwheeled
trolley
in
front
of
me
and
a
hand
reached
from
between
two
leaning
rows
of
books
a
groping
hand
had
again
a
wellnigh
insurmountable
desire
to
begin
calling
them
this
afternoon
at
one
point
i
even
got
as
far
as
dialing
the
atlanta
area
code
with
stanley
uris
number
in
front
of
me
then
i
just
held
the
phone
against
my
ear
asking
myself
if
i
wanted
to
call
them
because
i
was
really
sure
one
hundred
percent
sure
or
simply
because
i'm
now
so
badly
spooked
that
i
can't
stand
to
be
alone
that
i
have
to
talk
to
someone
who
knows
or
will
know
what
it
is
i
am
spooked
about
for
a
moment
i
could
hear
richie
saying
batches
batches
we
doan
need
no
stinki
batches
senhorr
in
his
pancho
vanilla
voice
as
clearly
as
if
he
were
standing
beside
me
and
i
hung
up
the
phone
because
when
you
want
to
see
someone
as
badly
as
i
wanted
to
see
richie
or
any
of
them
at
that
moment
you
just
can't
trust
your
own
motivations
we
lie
best
when
we
lie
to
ourselves
the
fact
is
i'm
still
not
one
hundred
percent
sure
if
another
body
should
turn
up
i
will
call
but
for
now
i
must
suppose
that
even
such
a
pompous
ass
as
rademacher
may
be
right
she
could
have
remembered
her
father
there
may
have
been
pictures
of
him
and
i
suppose
a
really
persuasive
adult
could
talk
a
kid
into
coming
to
his
car
no
matter
what
that
child
had
been
taught
there
another
fear
that
haunts
me
rademacher
suggested
that
i
might
be
going
crazy
i
don't
believe
that
but
if
i
call
them
now
they
may
think
i'm
crazy
worse
than
that
what
if
they
should
not
remember
me
at
all
mike
hanlon
who
i
don't
remember
any
mike
hanlon
i
don't
remember
you
at
all
what
promise
i
feel
that
there
will
come
a
right
time
to
call
them
and
when
that
time
comes
i'll
know
that
it
right
their
own
circuits
will
open
at
the
same
time
it
as
if
there
are
two
great
wheels
slowly
coming
into
some
sort
of
powerful
convergence
with
each
other
myself
and
the
rest
of
derry
on
one
and
all
my
childhood
friends
on
the
other
when
the
time
comes
they
will
hear
the
voice
of
the
turtle
so
i'll
wait
and
sooner
or
later
i'll
know
i
don't
believe
it
a
question
anymore
of
calling
them
or
not
calling
them
only
a
question
of
when
february
th
the
fire
at
the
black
spot
a
perfect
example
of
how
the
chamber
of
commerce
will
try
to
rewrite
history
mike
old
albert
carson
would
have
told
me
probably
cackling
as
he
said
it
they'll
try
and
sometimes
they
almost
succeed
but
the
old
people
remember
how
things
really
went
they
always
remember
and
sometimes
they'll
tell
you
if
you
ask
them
right
there
are
people
who
have
lived
in
derry
for
twenty
years
and
don't
know
that
there
was
once
a
special
barracks
for
noncoms
at
the
old
derry
army
air
corps
base
a
barracks
that
was
a
good
half
a
mile
from
the
rest
of
the
base
and
in
the
middle
of
february
with
the
temperature
standing
right
around
zero
and
a
fortymileanhour
wind
howling
across
those
flat
runways
and
whopping
the
windchill
factor
down
to
something
you
could
hardly
believe
that
extra
half
a
mile
became
something
that
could
give
you
frostfreeze
or
frostbite
or
maybe
even
kill
you
the
other
seven
barracks
had
oil
heat
storm
windows
and
insulation
they
were
toasty
and
cozy
the
special
barracks
which
housed
the
twentyseven
men
of
company
e
was
heated
by
a
balky
old
wood
furnace
supplies
of
wood
for
it
were
catchascatchcan
the
only
insulation
was
the
deep
bank
of
pine
and
spruce
boughs
the
men
laid
around
the
outside
one
of
the
men
promoted
a
complete
set
of
storm
windows
for
the
place
one
day
but
the
twentyseven
inmates
of
the
special
barracks
were
detailed
up
to
bangor
that
same
day
to
help
with
some
work
at
the
base
up
there
and
when
they
came
back
that
night
tired
and
cold
all
of
those
windows
had
been
broken
every
one
this
was
in
when
half
of
america
air
force
still
consisted
of
biplanes
in
washington
billy
michell
had
been
courtmartialed
and
demoted
to
flying
a
desk
because
his
gadfly
insistence
on
trying
to
build
a
more
modern
air
force
had
finally
irritated
his
elders
enough
for
them
to
slap
him
down
hard
not
long
after
he
would
resign
so
there
was
precious
little
flying
that
went
on
at
the
derry
base
in
spite
of
its
three
runways
one
of
which
was
actually
paved
most
of
the
soldiering
that
went
on
there
was
of
the
make
work
variety
one
of
the
company
e
soldiers
who
returned
to
derry
after
his
service
tour
came
to
an
end
in
was
my
dad
he
told
me
this
story
one
day
in
the
spring
of
this
was
about
six
months
before
the
fire
at
the
black
spot
i
was
coming
back
with
four
of
my
buddies
from
a
threeday
pass
we
had
spent
down
in
boston
when
we
come
through
the
gate
there
was
this
big
old
boy
standing
just
inside
the
checkpoint
leaning
on
a
shovel
and
picking
the
seat
of
his
suntans
out
of
his
ass
a
sergeant
from
someplace
down
south
carrotyred
hair
bad
teeth
pimples
not
much
more
than
an
ape
without
the
body
hair
if
you
know
what
i
mean
there
were
a
lot
of
them
like
that
in
the
army
during
the
depression
so
here
we
come
four
young
guys
back
from
leave
all
of
us
still
feeling
fine
and
we
could
see
in
his
eyes
that
he
was
just
looking
for
something
to
bust
us
with
so
we
snapped
him
salutes
as
if
he
was
general
black
jack
pershing
himself
i
guess
we
might
have
been
all
right
but
it
was
one
fine
lateapril
day
sun
shining
down
and
i
had
to
shoot
off
my
lip
a
good
afternoon
to
you
sergeant
wilson
sir
said
i
and
he
landed
on
me
with
both
feet
did
i
give
you
any
permission
to
speak
to
me
he
asks
™nawsir
i
say
he
looks
around
at
the
rest
of
them
trevor
dawson
carl
roone
and
henry
whitsun
who
was
killed
in
the
fire
that
fall
and
he
says
to
them
this
here
smart
nigger
is
in
hack
with
me
if
the
rest
of
you
jigaboos
don't
want
to
join
him
in
one
hardworking
dirty
bitch
of
an
afternoon
you
get
over
to
your
barracks
stow
your
gar
and
get
your
asses
over
to
the
od
you
understand
well
they
got
going
and
wilson
hollers
doubletime
you
fuckers
lemme
see
the
soles
of
your
eighty
fucking
nines
so
they
doubletimed
off
and
wilson
took
me
over
to
one
of
the
equipment
sheds
and
he
got
me
a
spade
he
took
me
out
into
the
big
field
that
used
to
be
just
about
where
the
northeast
airlines
airbus
terminal
stands
today
and
he
looks
at
me
kind
of
grinning
and
he
points
at
the
ground
and
he
says
you
see
that
hole
there
nigger
there
was
no
hole
there
but
i
figured
it
was
best
for
me
to
agree
with
whatever
he
said
so
i
looked
down
at
the
ground
where
he
was
pointing
and
said
i
sure
did
see
it
so
then
he
busted
me
one
in
the
nose
and
knocked
me
over
and
there
i
vas
on
the
ground
with
blood
running
down
over
the
last
fresh
shirt
i
had
you
don't
see
it
because
some
bigmouth
jig
bastard
filled
it
up
he
shouted
at
me
and
he
had
two
big
blotches
of
color
on
his
cheeks
but
he
was
grinning
too
and
you
could
tell
he
was
enjoying
himself
so
what
you
do
mr
a
good
afternoon
to
you
what
you
do
is
you
get
the
dirt
out
of
my
hole
doubletime
so
i
dug
for
most
two
hours
and
pretty
soon
i
was
in
that
hole
up
to
my
chin
the
last
couple
of
feet
was
clay
and
by
the
time
i
finished
i
was
standing
in
water
up
to
my
ankles
and
my
shoes
were
soaked
right
through
get
out
of
there
hanlon
sergeant
wilson
said
he
was
sitting
there
on
the
grass
smoking
a
cigarette
he
didn't
offer
me
any
help
i
was
dirt
and
muck
from
top
to
bottom
not
to
mention
the
blood
drying
on
the
blouse
of
my
suntans
he
stood
up
and
walked
over
he
pointed
at
the
hole
what
do
you
see
there
nigger
he
asked
me
your
hole
sergeant
wilson
says
i
yeah
well
[decided
i
don't
want
it
he
says
i
don't
want
no
hole
dug
by
a
nigger
put
my
dirt
back
in
private
hanlon
so
i
filled
it
back
in
and
by
the
time
i
was
done
the
sun
was
going
down
and
it
was
getting
cold
he
comes
over
and
looks
at
it
after
i
finished
patting
down
the
last
of
the
dirt
with
the
flat
of
the
spade
now
what
do
you
see
there
nigger
he
asks
bunch
of
dirt
sir
i
said
and
he
hit
me
again
my
god
mikey
i
came
this
close
to
just
bouncing
up
off
n
the
ground
and
splitting
his
head
open
with
the
edge
of
that
shovel
but
if
i'd
done
that
i
never
would
have
looked
at
the
sky
again
except
through
a
set
of
bars
still
there
were
times
when
i
almost
think
it
would
have
been
worth
it
i
managed
to
hold
my
peace
somehow
though
that
ain't
a
bunch
of
dirt
you
stupid
coontail
nightfighter
he
screams
at
me
the
spit
flying
offn
his
lips
thats
my
hole
and
you
best
get
the
dirt
out
of
it
right
now
doubletime
so
i
dug
the
dirt
out
of
his
hole
and
then
i
filled
it
in
again
and
then
he
asks
me
why
i
went
and
filled
in
his
hole
just
when
he
was
getting
ready
to
take
a
crap
in
it
so
i
dug
it
out
again
and
he
drops
his
pants
and
hangs
his
skinnyshanks
cracker
redneck
ass
over
the
hole
and
he
grins
up
at
me
while
he
doing
his
business
and
says
how
you
doin
hanlon
i
am
doing
just
fine
sir
i
says
right
back
because
i
had
decided
i
wasn't
going
to
give
up
until
i
fell
unconscious
or
dropped
dead
i
had
my
dander
up
well
i
aim
to
fix
that
he
says
to
start
with
you
better
just
fill
that
hole
in
private
hanlon
and
i
want
to
see
some
life
you're
slowin
down
so
i
got
her
filled
in
again
and
i
could
see
by
the
way
he
was
grinning
that
he
was
only
warming
up
but
just
then
this
friend
of
his
came
humping
across
the
field
with
a
gas
lantern
and
told
him
there'd
been
a
surprise
inspection
and
wilson
was
in
hack
for
having
missed
it
my
friends
covered
for
me
and
i
was
okay
but
wilson
friends
if
that
what
he
called
them
couldn't
be
bothered
he
let
me
go
then
and
i
waited
to
see
if
his
name
would
go
up
on
the
punishment
roster
the
next
day
but
it
never
did
i
guess
he
must
have
just
told
the
loot
he
missed
the
inspection
because
he
was
teaching
a
smartmouth
nigger
who
it
was
owned
all
the
holes
at
the
derry
army
base
those
that
had
already
been
dug
and
those
that
hadn't
been
they
probably
gave
him
a
medal
instead
of
potatoes
to
peel
and
that
how
things
were
for
company
e
here
in
derry
it
was
right
around
that
my
father
told
me
the
story
and
i
guess
he
was
pushing
fifty
although
my
mother
was
only
forty
or
so
i
asked
him
if
that
was
the
way
derry
was
why
had
he
come
back
well
i
was
only
sixteen
when
i
joined
the
army
mikey
he
said
lied
about
ny
age
to
get
in
wasn't
my
idea
either
my
mother
told
me
to
do
it
i
was
big
and
that
the
only
reason
the
lie
stuck
i
guess
i
was
born
and
grew
up
in
burgaw
north
carolina
and
the
only
time
we
saw
meat
was
right
after
the
tobacco
was
in
or
sometimes
in
the
winter
if
my
father
shot
a
coon
or
a
possum
the
only
good
thing
i
remember
about
burgaw
is
possum
pie
with
hoecakes
spread
around
her
just
as
pretty
as
you
could
want
so
when
my
dad
died
in
an
accident
with
some
farm
machinery
my
ma
said
she
was
going
to
take
philly
loubird
up
to
corinth
where
she
had
people
philly
loubird
was
the
baby
of
the
family
you
mean
my
uncle
phil
i
asked
smiling
to
think
of
anybody
calling
him
philly
loubird
he
was
a
lawyer
in
tucson
arizona
and
had
been
on
the
city
council
there
for
six
years
when
i
was
a
kid
i
thought
uncle
phil
was
rich
for
a
black
man
in
i
suppose
he
was
he
made
twenty
thousand
dollars
a
year
that
who
i
mean
my
dad
said
but
in
those
days
he
was
just
a
twelveyearold
kid
who
wore
a
ricepaper
sailor
hat
and
mended
biballs
and
had
no
shoes
he
was
the
youngest
i
was
the
second
youngest
all
the
others
were
gone
two
dead
two
married
one
in
jail
that
was
howard
he
never
was
any
good
you
are
goan
join
the
army
your
gramma
shirley
told
me
i
dunno
if
they
start
paying
you
right
away
or
not
but
once
they
do
you're
goan
send
me
a
lotment
every
month
i
hate
to
send
you
away
son
but
if
you
don't
take
care
of
me
and
philly
i
don't
know
what
going
to
become
of
us
she
gave
me
my
birth
certificate
to
show
the
recruiter
and
i
seen
she
fixed
the
year
on
it
somehow
to
make
me
eighteen
so
i
went
to
the
courthouse
where
the
army
recruiter
was
and
asked
about
joining
up
he
showed
me
the
papers
and
the
line
where
i
could
make
my
mark
i
kin
write
my
name
i
said
and
he
laughed
like
he
didn't
believe
me
™well
then
you
go
on
and
write
it
black
boy
he
says
hang
on
a
minute
i
says
back
i
want
to
ast
you
a
couple
of
questions
fire
away
then
he
says
i
can
answer
anything
you
can
ask
do
they
have
meat
twice
a
week
in
the
army
i
asked
my
mamma
says
they
do
but
she
is
powerful
set
on
me
joining
up
no
they
don't
have
it
twice
a
week
he
says
well
that
about
what
i
thought”
i
says
thinking
that
the
man
surely
does
seem
like
a
booger
but
at
least
he
an
honest
booger
then
he
says
they
got
it
ever
night
making
me
wonder
how
i
ever
could
have
thought
he
was
honest
™you
must
think
i'm
a
pured
fool
i
says
you
got
that
right
nigger
he
says
well
if
i
join
up
i
got
to
do
something
for
my
mamma
and
philly
loubird
i
says
mamma
says
it
a
lotment
that
this
here
he
says
and
taps
the
allotment
form
now
what
else
is
on
your
mind
well
says
i
what
about
trainin
to
be
an
officer
he
threw
his
head
back
when
i
said
that
and
laughed
until
i
thought
he
was
gonna
choke
on
his
own
spit
then
he
says
son
the
day
they
got
nigger
officers
n
this
man
army
will
be
the
day
you
see
the
bleedin
jesus
christ
doing
the
charleston
at
birdland
now
you
sign
or
you
don't
sign
i'm
out
of
patience
also
you're
stinkin
the
place
up
so
i
signed
and
watched
him
staple
the
allotment
form
to
my
mustersheet
and
then
he
give
me
the
oath
and
then
i
was
a
soldier
i
was
thinking
that
they'd
send
me
up
to
new
jersey
where
the
army
was
building
bridges
on
account
of
there
being
no
wars
to
fight
instead
i
got
derry
maine
and
company
e
he
sighed
and
shifted
in
his
chair
a
big
man
with
white
hair
that
curled
close
to
his
skull
at
that
time
we
had
one
of
the
bigger
farms
in
derry
and
probably
the
best
roadside
produce
stand
south
of
bangor
the
three
of
us
worked
hard
and
my
father
had
to
hire
on
extra
help
during
harvesting
time
and
we
made
out
he
said
i
came
back
because
i'd
seen
the
south
and
i'd
seen
the
north
and
there
was
the
same
hate
in
both
places
it
wasn't
sergeant
wilson
that
convinced
me
of
that
he
was
nothing
but
a
georgia
cracker
and
he
took
the
south
with
him
wherever
he
went
he
didn't
have
to
be
south
of
the
mason
dixon
line
to
hate
niggers
he
just
did
no
it
was
the
fire
at
the
black
spot
that
convinced
me
of
that
you
know
mikey
in
a
way
he
glanced
over
at
my
mother
who
was
knitting
she
hadn't
looked
up
but
i
knew
she
was
listening
closely
and
my
father
knew
it
too
i
think
in
a
way
it
was
the
fire
made
me
a
man
there
was
sixty
people
killed
in
that
fire
eighteen
of
them
from
company
e
there
really
wasn't
any
company
left
when
that
fire
was
over
henry
whitsun
stork
anson
alan
snopes
everett
mccaslin
horton
sartoris
all
my
friends
all
dead
in
that
fire
and
that
fire
wasn't
set
by
old
sarge
wilson
and
hs
gritsandcornpone
friends
it
was
set
by
the
derry
branch
of
the
maine
legion
of
white
decency
some
of
the
kids
you
go
to
school
with
son
their
fathers
struck
the
matches
that
lit
the
black
spot
on
fire
and
i'm
not
talking
about
the
poor
kids
neither
why
daddy
why
did
they
well
part
of
it
was
just
derry
my
father
said
frowning
he
lit
his
pipe
slowly
and
shook
out
the
wooden
match
i
don't
know
why
it
happened
here
i
can't
explain
it
but
at
the
same
time
i
ain't
surprised
by
it
the
legion
of
white
decency
was
the
northerner
version
of
the
ku
klux
klan
you
see
they
marched
in
the
same
white
sheets
they
burned
the
same
crosses
they
wrote
the
same
hatenotes
to
black
folks
they
felt
were
getting
above
their
station
or
taking
jobs
that
were
meant
for
white
men
in
churches
where
the
preachers
talked
about
black
equality
they
sometimes
planted
charges
of
dynamite
most
of
the
history
books
talk
more
about
the
kkk
than
they
do
about
the
legion
of
white
decency
and
a
lot
of
people
don't
even
know
there
was
such
a
thing
i
think
it
might
be
because
most
of
the
histories
have
been
written
by
northerners
and
they're
ashamed
tt
was
most
pop'lar
in
the
big
cities
and
the
manufacturin
areas
new
york
new
jersey
detroit
baltimore
boston
portsmouth
they
all
had
their
chapters
they
tried
to
organize
in
maine
but
derry
was
the
only
place
they
had
any
real
success
oh
for
awhile
there
was
a
pretty
good
chapter
in
lewiston
this
was
around
the
same
time
as
the
fire
at
the
black
spot
but
they
weren't
worried
about
niggers
raping
white
women
or
taking
jobs
that
should
have
belonged
to
white
men
because
there
weren't
any
niggers
to
speak
of
up
here
in
lewiston
they
were
worried
about
tramps
and
hobos
and
that
something
called
the
bonus
army
would
join
up
with
something
they
called
the
communist
riffraff
army”
by
which
they
meant
any
man
who
was
out
of
work
the
legion
of
decency
used
to
send
these
fellows
out
of
town
just
as
fast
as
they
came
in
sometimes
they
stuffed
poison
ivy
down
the
backs
of
their
pants
sometimes
they
set
their
shirts
on
fire
well
the
legion
was
pretty
much
done
up
here
after
the
fire
at
the
black
spot
things
got
out
of
hand
you
see
the
way
things
seem
to
do
in
this
town
sometimes
he
paused
puffing
its
like
the
legion
of
white
decency
was
just
another
seed
mikey
and
it
found
some
earth
that
nourished
it
well
here
it
was
a
regular
richman
club
and
after
the
fire
they
all
just
laid
away
their
sheets
and
lied
each
other
up
and
it
was
papered
over
now
there
was
a
kind
of
vicious
contempt
in
his
voice
that
made
my
mother
look
up
frowning
after
all
who
got
killed
eighteen
army
niggers
fourteen
or
fifteen
town
niggers
four
members
of
a
nigger
jazzband
and
a
bunch
of
niggerlovers
what
did
it
matter
will
my
mother
said
softly
that
enough
n
i
said
i
want
to
hear
its
getting
to
be
your
bedtime
mike
he
said
ruffling
my
hair
with
his
big
hard
hand
just
want
to
tell
you
one
thing
more
and
i
don't
think
you'll
understand
it
because
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
it
myself
what
happened
that
night
at
the
black
spot
bad
as
it
was
i
don't
really
think
it
happened
because
we
was
black
not
even
because
the
spot
was
close
behind
west
broadway
where
the
rich
whites
in
derry
lived
then
and
still
live
today
i
don't
think
that
the
legion
of
white
decency
happened
to
get
along
so
well
here
because
they
hated
black
people
and
bums
more
in
derry
than
they
did
in
portland
or
lewiston
or
brunswick
it
because
of
that
soil
it
seems
that
bad
things
hurtful
things
do
nght
well
in
the
soil
of
this
town
i've
thought
so
again
and
again
over
the
years
i
don't
know
why
it
should
be
but
it
is
but
there
are
good
folks
lere
too
and
there
were
good
folks
here
then
when
the
funerals
were
held
afterward
thousands
of
people
turned
out
and
they
turned
out
for
the
blacks
as
well
as
the
whites
businesses
closed
up
for
most
of
a
week
the
hospitals
treated
the
hurt
ones
free
of
charge
there
were
food
baskets
and
letters
of
condolence
that
were
honestly
meant
and
there
were
helping
hands
held
out
i
met
my
friend
dewey
conroy
during
that
time
and
you
know
he
just
as
white
as
vanilla
ice
cream
but
i
feel
like
he
my
brother
i'd
die
for
dewey
if
he
asked
me
to
and
although
no
man
really
knows
another
man
heart
i
think
he'd
die
for
me
if
it
came
to
that
anyway
the
army
sent
away
those
of
us
that
were
left
after
that
fire
like
they
were
ashamed
and
i
guess
they
were
i
ended
up
down
at
fort
hood
and
i
stayed
there
for
six
years
i
met
your
mother
there
and
we
were
married
in
galveston
at
her
folks
house
but
ail
through
the
years
between
derry
never
escaped
my
mind
and
after
the
war
i
brought
your
mom
back
here
and
we
had
you
and
here
we
are
not
three
miles
from
where
the
black
spot
stood
in
and
i
think
it
your
bedtime
mr
man
i
want
to
hear
about
the
fire
i
yelled
tell
me
about
it
daddy
and
he
looked
at
me
in
that
frowning
way
that
always
shut
me
up
maybe
because
he
didn't
look
that
way
often
mostly
he
was
a
smiling
man
that
no
story
for
a
boy
he
said
another
time
mikey
when
we've
both
walked
around
a
few
more
years
as
it
turned
out
we
both
walked
aound
another
four
years
before
i
heard
the
story
of
what
happened
at
the
black
spot
that
night
and
by
then
my
father
walking
days
were
all
done
he
told
me
from
the
hospital
bed
where
he
lay
full
of
dope
dozing
in
and
out
of
reality
as
the
cancer
worked
away
inside
of
his
intestines
eating
him
up
february
th
i
got
reading
over
what
i
had
written
last
in
this
notebook
and
surprised
myself
by
bursting
into
tears
over
my
father
who
has
now
been
dead
for
twentythree
years
i
can
remember
my
grief
for
him
it
lasted
for
almost
two
years
then
when
i
graduated
from
high
school
in
and
my
mother
looked
at
me
and
said
how
proud
your
father
would
have
been
we
cried
in
each
other
arms
and
i
thought
that
was
the
end
that
we
had
finished
the
job
of
burying
him
with
those
late
tears
but
who
knows
how
long
a
grief
may
last
isn't
it
possible
that
even
thirty
or
forty
years
after
the
death
of
a
child
or
a
brother
or
a
sister
one
may
half
waken
thinking
of
that
person
with
that
same
lost
emptiness
that
feeling
of
places
which
may
never
be
filled
perhaps
not
even
in
death
he
left
the
army
in
with
a
disability
pension
by
that
year
my
father
army
had
become
a
good
deal
more
warlike
anyone
with
half
an
eye
he
told
me
ome
could
see
by
then
that
soon
all
the
guns
would
be
coming
out
of
storage
again
he
had
risen
to
the
rank
of
sergeant
in
the
interim
and
he
had
lost
most
of
his
left
foot
when
a
new
recruit
who
was
so
scared
he
was
almost
shitting
peachpits
pulled
the
pin
on
a
hand
grenade
and
then
dropped
it
instead
of
throwing
it
it
rolled
over
to
my
father
and
exploded
with
a
sound
that
was
he
said
like
a
cough
in
the
middle
of
the
night
a
lot
of
the
ordnance
those
longago
soldiers
had
to
train
with
was
either
defective
or
had
sat
so
long
in
almost
forgotten
supply
depots
that
it
was
impotent
they
had
bullets
that
wouldn't
fire
and
rifles
that
sometimes
exploded
in
their
hands
when
the
bullets
did
fire
the
navy
had
torpedoes
that
usually
didn't
go
where
they
were
aimed
and
didn't
explode
when
they
did
the
army
air
corps
and
the
navy
air
arm
had
planes
whose
wings
fell
off
if
they
landed
hard
and
at
pensacola
in
i
have
read
a
supply
officer
discovered
a
whole
fleet
of
government
trucks
that
wouldn't
run
because
cockroaches
had
eaten
the
rubber
hoses
and
the
fanbelts
so
my
father
life
was
saved
including
of
course
the
part
of
him
that
became
your
ob'dt
servant
michael
hanlon
by
a
combination
of
bureaucratic
porkbarrelling
folderol
and
defective
equipment
the
grenade
only
halfexploded
and
he
just
lost
part
of
one
foot
instead
of
everything
from
the
breastbone
on
down
because
of
the
disability
money
he
was
able
to
marry
my
mother
a
year
earlier
than
he
had
planned
they
didn't
come
to
derry
at
once
they
moved
to
houston
where
they
did
war
work
until
my
father
was
a
foreman
in
a
factory
that
made
bombcasings
my
mother
was
a
rosie
the
riveter
but
as
he
told
me
that
night
when
i
was
eleven
the
thought
of
derry
never
escaped
his
mind
and
now
i
wonder
if
that
blind
thing
might
not
have
been
at
work
even
then
drawing
nun
back
so
i
could
take
my
place
in
that
circle
in
the
barrens
that
august
evening
if
the
wheels
of
the
universe
are
in
true
then
good
always
compensates
for
evil
but
good
can
be
awful
as
well
my
father
had
a
subscription
to
the
derry
news
he
kept
his
eye
on
the
ads
announcing
land
for
sale
they
had
saved
up
a
good
bit
of
money
at
last
he
saw
a
farm
for
sale
that
looked
like
a
good
proposition
on
paper
at
least
the
two
of
them
rode
up
from
texas
on
a
trailways
bus
looked
at
it
and
bought
it
the
same
day
the
first
merchants
of
penobscot
county
issued
my
father
a
ten
year
mortgage
and
they
settled
down
we
had
some
problems
at
first
my
father
said
another
time
there
were
people
who
didn't
want
negroes
in
the
neighborhood
we
knew
it
was
going
to
be
that
way
i
hadn't
forgotten
about
the
black
spot
and
we
just
hunkered
down
to
wait
it
out
kids
would
go
by
and
throw
rocks
or
beer
cans
i
must
have
replaced
twenty
windows
that
first
year
and
some
of
them
weren't
just
kids
either
one
day
when
we
got
up
there
was
a
swastika
painted
on
the
side
of
the
chickenhouse
and
all
the
chickens
were
dead
someone
had
poisoned
their
feed
those
were
the
last
chickens
i
ever
tried
to
keep
but
the
county
sheriff
there
wasn't
any
police
chief
in
those
days
derry
wasn't
quite
big
enough
for
such
a
thing
got
to
work
on
the
matter
and
he
worked
hard
that
what
i
mean
mikey
when
i
say
there
is
good
here
as
well
as
bad
it
didn't
make
any
difference
to
that
man
sullivan
that
ry
skin
was
brown
and
my
hair
was
kinky
he
come
out
half
a
dozen
times
he
talked
to
people
and
finally
he
found
out
who
done
it
and
who
do
you
think
it
was
i'll
give
you
three
guesses
and
the
first
two
don't
coun
don't
know
i
said
my
father
laughed
until
tears
spouted
out
of
his
eyes
he
took
a
big
white
handkerchief
out
of
his
pocket
and
wiped
them
away
why
it
was
butch
bowers
that
who
the
father
of
the
kid
you
say
is
the
biggest
bully
at
your
school
the
father
a
turd
and
the
son
a
little
fart
there
are
kids
at
school
who
say
henry
father
is
crazy
i
told
him
i
think
i
was
in
the
fourth
grade
at
that
time
far
enough
along
to
have
had
my
can
righteously
kicked
by
henry
bowers
more
than
once
anyway
and
now
that
i
think
about
it
most
of
the
pejorative
terms
for
black
or
negr
i've
ever
heard
i
heard
first
from
the
lips
of
henry
bowers
between
grades
one
and
four
well
i'll
tell
you
he
said
the
idea
that
butch
bowers
is
crazy
might
not
be
far
wrong
people
said
he
was
never
right
after
he
come
back
from
the
pacific
he
was
in
the
marines
over
there
anyway
the
sheriff
took
him
into
custody
and
butch
was
hollering
that
it
was
a
putup
job
and
they
were
all
just
a
bunch
of
niggerlovers
oh
he
was
gonna
sue
everybody
i
guess
he
had
a
list
that
would
have
stretched
from
here
to
witcham
street
i
doubt
if
he
had
a
single
pair
of
underdrawers
that
was
whole
in
the
seat
but
he
was
going
to
sue
me
sheriff
sullivan
the
town
of
derry
the
county
of
penobscot
and
god
alone
knows
who
else
as
to
what
happened
next
well
i
can't
swear
it
true
but
this
is
how
i
heard
it
from
dewey
conroy
dewey
said
he
sheriff
went
in
to
see
butch
at
the
jail
up
in
bangor
and
sheriff
sullivan
says
it
time
for
you
to
shut
your
mouth
and
do
some
listening
butch
that
black
guy
he
don't
want
to
press
charges
he
don't
want
to
send
you
to
shawshank
he
just
wants
the
worth
of
his
chickens
he
figures
two
hundred
dollars
would
do
her
butch
tells
the
sheriff
he
can
put
his
two
hundred
dollars
where
the
sun
don't
shine
and
sheriff
sullivan
he
tells
butch
they
got
a
lime
pit
down
at
the
shank
butch
and
they
tell
me
after
you've
been
workin
there
about
two
years
your
tongue
goes
as
green
as
a
lime
popsicle
now
you
pick
two
years
peelin
lime
or
two
hundred
dollars
what
do
you
think
no
jury
in
maine
will
convict
me
butch
says
not
for
killing
a
ngger
chickens
i
know
that
sullivan
says
then
what
the
christ
are
we
chinnin
about
butch
asts
him
you
better
wake
up
butch
they
won't
put
you
away
for
the
chickens
but
they
will
put
you
away
for
the
swastiker
you
painted
on
the
door
after
you
killed
em
well
dewey
said
butch
mouth
just
kind
of
dropped
open
and
sullivan
went
away
to
let
him
think
about
it
about
three
days
later
butch
told
his
brother
the
one
that
froze
to
death
couple
of
years
after
while
out
hunting
drunk
to
sell
his
new
mercury
which
butch
had
bought
with
his
musterout
pay
and
was
mighty
sweet
on
so
i
got
my
two
hundred
dollars
and
butch
swore
he
was
going
to
burn
me
out
he
went
around
telling
all
his
friends
that
so
i
caught
up
with
him
one
afternoon
he'd
bought
an
old
prewar
ford
to
replace
the
merc
and
i
had
my
pickup
i
cut
him
off
out
on
witcham
street
by
the
trainyards
and
got
out
with
my
winchester
rifle
any
fires
out
my
way
and
you
got
one
bad
black
man
gunning
for
you
old
boss
i
told
him
you
can't
talk
to
me
that
way
nigger
he
said
and
he
was
damn
near
to
blubbering
between
being
mad
and
being
scared
you
can't
talk
to
no
white
man
that
way
not
a
jig
like
you
well
i'd
had
enough
of
the
whole
thing
mikey
and
i
knew
if
i
didn't
scare
him
off
for
good
right
then
i'd
never
be
shed
of
him
there
wasn't
nobody
around
i
reached
in
that
ford
with
one
hand
and
caught
him
by
the
hair
of
the
head
i
put
the
stock
of
my
rifle
against
the
buckle
of
my
belt
and
gt
the
muzzle
right
up
under
his
chin
i
said
the
next
time
you
call
me
a
nigger
or
a
jig
your
brains
are
going
to
be
dripping
off
the
domelight
of
your
car
and
you
believe
me
butch
any
fires
out
my
way
and
i'm
gunning
for
you
i
may
come
gunning
for
your
wife
and
your
brat
and
your
nocount
brother
as
well
i
have
had
enough
then
he
did
start
to
cry
and
i
never
saw
an
uglier
sight
in
my
life
look
what
things
has
come
to
here
he
says
when
a
nih
when
a
jih
when
a
feller
can
pit
a
gun
toa
workingman
head
in
broad
daylight
by
the
side
of
the
road
yeah
the
world
must
be
going
to
a
campmeeting
hell
when
something
like
that
can
happen
i
agreed
but
that
don't
matter
now
all
that
matters
now
is
do
we
have
an
understanding
here
or
do
you
want
to
see
if
you
can
learn
how
to
breathe
through
your
forehead
he
allowed
as
how
we
had
an
understanding
and
that
was
the
last
bit
of
trouble
i
ever
had
with
butch
bowers
except
for
maybe
when
your
dog
mr
chips
died
and
i've
got
no
proof
that
was
bowers
doing
chippy
might
have
just
got
a
poison
bait
or
something
since
that
day
we've
been
pretty
much
left
alone
to
make
our
way
and
when
i
look
back
on
it
there
ain't
much
i
regret
we've
had
a
good
life
here
and
if
there
are
nights
when
i
dream
about
that
fire
well
there
isn't
nobody
that
can
live
a
natural
life
without
having
a
few
bad
dreams
february
th
it
been
days
since
i
sat
down
to
write
the
story
of
the
fire
at
the
black
spot
as
my
father
told
it
to
me
and
i
haven't
gotten
to
it
yet
its
in
the
lord
of
the
rings
i
think
where
one
of
the
characters
says
that
way
leads
on
to
way
that
you
could
start
at
a
path
leading
nowhere
more
fantastic
than
from
your
own
front
steps
to
the
sidewalk
and
from
there
you
could
go
well
anywhere
at
all
it
the
same
way
with
stories
one
leads
to
the
next
to
the
next
and
to
the
next
maybe
they
go
in
the
direction
you
wanted
to
go
but
maybe
they
don't
maybe
in
the
end
it
the
voice
that
tells
the
stories
more
than
the
stories
themselves
that
matters
it
his
voice
that
i
remember
certainly
my
father
voice
low
and
slow
how
he
would
chuckle
sometimes
or
laugh
outright
the
pauses
to
light
his
pipe
or
to
blow
his
nose
or
to
go
and
get
a
can
of
narragansett
nasty
gansett
he
called
it
from
the
icebox
that
voice
which
is
for
me
somehow
the
voice
of
all
voices
the
voice
of
all
years
the
ultimate
voice
of
this
place
one
that
in
none
of
the
ives
interviews
nor
in
any
of
the
poor
histories
of
this
place
nor
on
any
of
ray
own
tapes
my
father
voice
now
it
ten
o'clock
the
library
closed
an
hour
ago
and
a
proper
old
jeezer
is
starting
to
crank
up
outside
i
can
hear
tiny
spicules
of
sleet
striking
the
windows
in
here
and
in
the
glassedin
corridor
which
leads
to
the
children
library
i
can
hear
other
sounds
too
stealthy
creaks
and
bumps
outside
the
circle
of
light
where
i
sit
writing
on
the
lined
yellow
pages
of
a
legal
pad
just
the
sounds
of
an
old
building
ettling
i
tell
myself
but
i
wonder
as
i
wonder
if
somewhere
out
in
this
storm
there
is
a
clown
selling
balloons
tonight
well
never
mind
i
think
i've
finally
found
my
way
to
my
father
final
story
i
heard
it
in
his
hospital
room
no
more
than
six
weeks
before
he
died
i
went
to
see
him
with
my
mother
every
afternoon
after
school
and
alone
every
evening
my
mother
had
to
stay
home
and
do
the
chores
then
but
she
insisted
that
i
go
i
rode
my
bike
she
wouldn't
let
me
hook
rides
not
even
four
years
after
the
murders
had
ended
that
was
a
hard
six
weeks
for
a
boy
who
was
only
fifteen
i
loved
my
father
but
i
came
to
hate
those
evening
visits
watching
him
shrink
and
shrivel
watching
the
painlines
spread
and
deepen
on
his
face
sometimes
he
would
cry
although
he
tried
not
to
and
going
home
it
would
be
getting
dark
and
i
would
think
back
to
the
summer
of
and
i'd
be
afraid
to
look
behind
me
because
the
clown
might
be
there
or
the
werewolf
or
ben
mummy
or
my
bird
but
i
was
mostly
afraid
that
no
matter
what
shape
it
took
it
would
have
my
father
cancerraddled
face
so
i
would
pedal
as
fast
as
i
could
no
matter
how
hard
my
heart
thundered
in
my
chest
and
come
in
flushed
and
sweatyhaired
and
out
of
breath
and
my
mother
would
say
why
do
you
want
to
ride
so
fast
mikey
you'll
make
yourself
sic
and
i'd
say
i
wanted
to
get
back
in
time
to
help
you
with
the
chores
and
she'd
give
me
a
hug
and
a
kiss
and
tell
me
i
was
a
good
boy
as
time
went
on
it
got
so
i
could
hardly
think
of
things
to
talk
about
with
him
anymore
riding
into
town
i'd
rack
my
brain
for
subjects
of
conversation
dreading
the
moment
when
both
of
us
would
run
out
of
things
to
say
his
dying
scared
me
and
enraged
me
but
it
embarrassed
me
too
it
seemed
to
me
then
and
it
seems
to
me
now
that
when
a
man
or
woman
goes
it
should
be
a
quick
thing
the
cancer
was
doing
more
than
killing
him
it
was
degrading
him
demeaning
him
we
never
spoke
of
the
cancer
and
in
some
of
those
silences
i
thought
that
we
must
speak
of
it
that
there
would
be
nothing
else
and
we
would
be
stuck
with
it
like
kids
caught
without
a
place
to
sit
in
a
game
of
musical
chairs
when
the
piano
stops
and
i
would
become
almost
frantic
trying
to
think
of
something
anything
to
say
so
that
we
would
not
have
to
acknowledge
the
thing
which
was
now
destroying
my
daddy
who
had
once
taken
butch
bowers
by
the
hair
and
jammed
his
rifle
into
the
shelf
of
his
chin
and
demanded
of
butch
to
be
left
alone
we
would
be
forced
to
speak
of
it
and
if
we
were
i
would
cry
i
wouldn't
be
able
to
help
it
and
at
fifteen
i
think
the
thought
of
crying
in
front
of
my
father
scared
and
distressed
me
more
than
anything
else
it
was
during
one
of
those
interminable
scary
pauses
that
i
asked
him
again
about
the
fire
at
the
black
spot
they'd
filled
him
full
of
dope
that
evening
because
the
pain
was
very
bad
and
he
had
been
drifting
in
and
out
of
consciousness
sometimes
speaking
clearly
sometimes
speaking
in
that
exotic
language
i
think
of
as
sleepmud
sometimes
i
knew
he
was
talking
to
me
but
at
other
times
he
seemed
to
have
me
confused
with
his
brother
phil
i
asked
hull
about
the
black
spot
for
no
real
reason
it
had
just
jumped
into
my
mind
and
i
seized
on
it
his
eyes
sharpened
and
he
smiled
a
little
you
ain't
never
forgot
that
have
you
mikey
no
sir
i
said
and
although
i
hadn't
thought
about
it
in
three
years
or
better
i
added
what
he
sometimes
said
it
hasn't
ever
escaped
my
mind
well
i'll
tell
you
now
he
said
fifteen
is
old
enough
i
guess
and
your
mother
ain't
here
to
stop
me
besides
you
ought
to
know
i
think
something
like
it
could
only
have
happened
in
derry
and
you
need
to
know
that
too
so
you
can
beware
the
conditions
for
such
things
have
always
seemed
right
here
you're
careful
aren't
you
mikey
yes
si
i
said
goo
he
said
and
his
head
dropped
back
on
his
pillow
that
good
i
thought
he
was
going
to
drift
off
again
his
eyes
had
slipped
closed
but
instead
he
began
to
talk
when
i
was
at
the
army
base
here
in
and
'
he
said
there
was
an
nco
club
up
there
on
the
hill
where
derry
community
college
is
now
it
was
right
behind
the
px
where
you
used
to
be
able
to
get
a
pack
of
lucky
strike
greens
for
seven
cents
the
nco
club
was
only
a
big
old
quonset
hut
but
they
had
fixed
it
up
nice
inside
carpet
on
the
floor
booths
along
the
walls
a
jukebox
and
you
could
get
soft
drinks
on
the
weekend
if
you
were
white
that
was
they
would
have
bands
in
most
saturday
nights
and
it
was
quite
a
place
to
go
it
was
just
pop
over
the
bar
it
being
prohibition
but
we
heard
you
could
get
stronger
stuff
if
you
wanted
it
and
if
you
had
a
little
green
star
on
your
army
card
that
was
like
a
secret
sign
they
had
homebrew
beer
mostly
but
on
weekends
you
could
sometimes
get
stronger
stuff
if
you
were
white
us
company
e
boys
weren't
allowed
any
place
near
it
of
course
so
we
went
on
the
town
if
we
had
a
pass
in
the
evening
in
those
days
derry
was
still
something
of
a
logging
town
and
there
were
eight
or
ten
bars
most
of
em
down
in
a
part
of
town
they
called
hell
half
acre
they
wasn't
speakeasies
that
was
too
grand
a
name
for
em
wasn't
anybody
in
em
spoke
very
easy
anyhow
they
was
what
folks
called
blind
pigs
and
that
was
about
right
because
most
of
the
customers
acted
like
pigs
when
they
were
in
there
and
they
was
about
blind
when
they
turned
em
out
the
sheriff
knew
and
the
cops
knew
but
those
places
roared
all
night
long
same
as
they'd
done
since
the
logging
days
in
the
s
i
suppose
palms
got
greased
but
maybe
not
as
many
or
with
so
much
as
you
might
think
in
derry
people
have
a
way
of
looking
the
odier
way
some
served
hard
stuff
as
well
as
beer
and
by
all
accounts
i
ever
heard
the
stuff
you
could
get
in
town
was
ten
times
as
good
as
the
rotgut
whiskey
and
bathtub
gin
you
could
get
at
the
white
boys
nco
on
friday
and
saturday
nights
the
downtown
hooch
came
over
the
border
from
canada
in
pulp
trucks
and
most
of
them
bottles
had
what
the
labels
said
the
good
stuff
was
expensive
but
there
was
plenty
of
furnaceoil
too
and
it
might
hang
you
over
but
it
didn't
kill
you
and
if
you
did
go
blind
it
didn't
last
on
any
given
night
you'd
have
to
duck
your
head
when
the
bottks
came
flying
by
there
was
nan
the
paradise
wally
spa
the
silver
dollar
and
one
bar
the
powderhorn
where
you
could
sometimes
get
a
whore
oh
you
could
pick
up
a
woman
at
any
pig
you
didn't
even
have
to
work
at
it
that
hard
there
was
a
lot
d
them
wanted
to
find
out
if
a
slice
off
n
the
rye
loaf
was
any
different
but
to
kids
like
me
and
trevor
dawson
and
carl
roone
my
friends
in
those
days
the
thought
of
buying
a
whore
a
white
whore
that
was
something
you
had
to
sit
down
and
consider
as
i've
told
you
he
was
heavily
doped
that
night
i
don't
believe
he
would
have
said
any
of
that
stuff
not
to
his
fifteen
yearold
son
if
he
had
not
been
well
it
wasn't
very
long
before
a
representative
of
the
town
council
showed
up
wanting
to
see
major
fuller
he
said
he
wanted
to
talk
about
some
problems
between
the
townspeople
and
the
enlisted
men
and
concerns
of
the
electorate
and
questions
of
propriety
but
what
he
really
wanted
fuller
to
know
was
as
clear
as
a
windowpane
they
didn't
want
no
army
niggers
in
their
pigs
botherin
white
women
and
drinkin
illegal
hooch
at
a
bar
where
only
white
men
was
supposed
to
be
standin
and
drinkin
illegal
hooch
all
of
which
was
a
laugh
all
right
the
flower
of
white
womanhood
they
were
so
worried
about
was
mostly
a
bunch
of
barbags
and
as
far
as
getting
in
the
way
of
the
men
well
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
never
saw
a
member
of
the
derry
town
council
down
in
the
silver
dollar
or
in
the
powderhorn
the
men
who
drank
in
those
dyes
were
pulpcutters
in
those
big
redandblackchecked
lumberman
jackets
scars
and
scabs
all
over
their
hands
some
of
em
missing
eyes
or
fingers
all
of
em
missing
most
of
then
teeth
all
of
em
smellin
like
woodchips
and
sawdust
and
sap
they
wore
geen
flannel
pants
and
green
gumrubber
boots
and
tracked
snow
across
the
floor
until
it
was
black
with
it
they
smelled
big
mikey
and
they
walked
big
and
they
talked
big
they
were
big
i
was
in
wally
spa
one
night
when
i
saw
a
fella
split
his
shirt
nght
down
one
arm
while
he
was
armrassling
this
other
fella
it
didn't
just
rip
you
probably
think
that
what
i
mean
but
it
ain't
arm
of
that
man
shirt
damn
near
exploded
sort
of
blew
off
his
arm
in
rags
and
everybody
cheered
and
applauded
and
somebody
slapped
me
on
the
back
and
said
that
what
you
call
an
armrassler
fart
blackface
what
i'm
telling
you
is
that
if
the
men
who
used
those
blind
pigs
on
friday
and
saturday
nights
when
they
come
out
of
the
woods
to
drink
whiskey
and
fuck
women
instead
of
knotholes
greased
up
with
lard
if
those
men
hadn't
wanted
us
there
they
would
have
thrown
us
out
on
our
asses
but
the
fact
of
it
was
mikey
they
didn't
seem
to
give
much
of
a
toot
one
way
or
the
other
one
of
em
took
me
aside
one
night
he
was
six
foot
which
was
damn
big
for
those
days
and
he
was
dead
drunk
and
he
smelled
as
high
as
a
basket
of
monthold
peaches
if
he'd
stepped
out
of
his
clothes
i
think
they
would
have
stood
up
alone
he
looks
at
me
and
says
mister
i
gonna
ast
you
sumpin
me
are
you
be
a
negro
that
right
i
says
'comme
ça
va
he
says
in
the
saint
john
valley
french
that
sounds
almost
like
cajun
talk
and
grins
so
big
i
saw
all
four
of
his
teeth
i
knew
you
was
me
hey
i
seen
one
in
a
book
once
had
the
same
and
he
couldn't
think
how
to
say
what
was
on
his
mind
so
he
reaches
out
and
flaps
at
my
mouth
big
lips
i
says
yeah
yeah
he
says
laughin
like
a
kid
beeg
leeps
epais
rvres
beeg
leeps
gonna
buy
you
a
beer
me
buy
away
i
says
not
wanting
to
get
on
his
bad
side
he
laughed
at
that
too
and
clapped
me
on
the
back
almost
knocking
me
on
my
face
and
pushed
his
way
up
to
the
plankwood
bar
where
there
must
have
been
seventy
men
and
maybe
fifteen
women
lined
up
i
need
two
beers
fore
i
tear
this
dump
apart
he
yells
at
the
bartender
who
was
a
big
lug
with
a
broken
nose
named
romeo
dupree
one
for
me
and

and
they
all
laughed
like
hell
at
that
but
not
in
a
mean
way
mikey
so
he
gets
the
beers
and
gives
me
mine
and
he
says
what
your
name
i
don't
want
to
call
you
beeg
leeps
me
don't
sound
good
william
hanlon
i
says
well
here
to
you
weelyum
anlon
he
says
no
here
you
i
says
you're
the
first
white
man
who
ever
bought
me
a
drink
which
was
true
so
we
drank
those
beers
down
and
then
we
had
two
more
and
he
says
you
sure
you're
a
negro
except
for
them
épais
leeps
you
look
just
like
a
white
man
with
brown
skin
to
me
my
father
got
to
laughing
at
this
and
so
did
i
he
laughed
so
hard
his
stomach
started
to
hurt
him
and
he
held
it
grimacing
his
eyes
turned
up
his
upper
plate
biting
down
on
his
lower
lip
you
want
me
to
ring
for
the
nurse
daddy
i
asked
alarmed
no
no
i'm
goan
be
okay
the
worst
thing
of
this
mikey
is
that
you
can't
even
laugh
anymore
when
you
feel
like
it
which
is
damn
seldom
he
fell
silent
for
a
few
moments
and
i
realize
now
that
that
was
the
only
time
we
came
close
to
talking
about
what
was
killing
him
maybe
it
would
have
been
better
better
for
both
of
us
if
we
had
done
more
he
took
a
sip
of
water
and
then
went
on
anyway
it
wasn't
the
few
women
who
travelled
the
pigs
and
it
wasn't
the
lumberjacks
that
made
up
their
main
custom
who
wanted
us
out
it
was
those
five
old
men
on
the
town
council
who
were
really
offended
them
and
the
dozen
or
so
men
that
stood
behind
them
derry
old
line
you
know
none
of
them
had
ever
stepped
a
foot
inside
of
the
paradise
or
wally
spa
they
did
their
boozing
at
the
country
club
which
then
stood
over
on
derry
heights
but
they
wanted
to
make
sure
that
none
of
those
barbags
or
peaveyswingers
got
polluted
by
the
blacks
of
company
e
so
major
fuller
says
i
never
wanted
them
here
in
the
first
place
i
keep
thinking
it
an
oversight
and
they'll
get
sent
back
down
south
or
maybe
to
new
jersey
that
not
my
problem
this
old
fart
tells
him
mueller
i
think
his
name
was
sally
mueller
father
i
asked
startled
sally
mueller
was
in
the
same
highschool
class
with
me
my
father
grinned
a
sour
crooked
little
grin
no
this
would
have
been
her
uncle
sally
mueller
dad
was
off
in
college
somewhere
then
but
if
he'd
been
in
dermy
he
would
have
been
there
i
guess
standing
with
his
brother
and
in
case
you're
wondering
how
true
this
part
of
the
story
is
all
i
can
tell
you
is
that
the
conversation
was
repeated
to
me
by
trevor
dawson
who
was
swabbing
the
floors
over
there
in
officer
country
that
day
and
heard
it
all
where
the
government
sends
the
black
boys
is
your
problem
not
mine
mueller
tells
major
fuller
my
problem
is
where
you're
letting
them
go
on
friday
and
saturday
nights
if
they
go
on
whooping
it
up
downtown
there
going
to
be
trouble
we've
got
the
legion
in
this
town
you
know
well
but
i
am
in
a
bit
of
a
tight
here
mr
mueller
he
says
i
can't
let
them
drink
over
at
the
nco
club
not
only
is
it
against
the
regulations
for
the
negroes
to
drink
with
the
whites
they
couldn't
anyway
it
an
nco
club
don't
you
see
every
one
of
those
black
boys
is
a
bucky
tail
private
thats
not
my
problem
either
i
simply
trust
you
will
take
care
of
the
matter
responsibility
accompanies
rank
and
off
he
goes
well
fuller
solved
the
problem
the
derry
army
base
was
a
damn
big
patch
of
land
in
those
days
although
there
wasn't
a
hell
of
a
lot
on
it
better
than
a
hundred
acres
all
told
going
north
it
ended
right
behind
west
broadway
where
a
sort
of
greenbelt
was
planted
where
memorial
park
is
now
that
was
where
the
black
spot
stood
it
was
just
an
old
requisition
shed
in
early
when
all
of
this
happened
but
major
fuller
mustered
in
company
e
and
told
us
it
was
going
to
be
our
club
acted
like
he
was
daddy
warbucks
or
something
and
maybe
he
even
felt
that
way
giving
a
bunch
of
black
privates
their
own
place
even
if
it
was
nothing
but
a
shed
then
he
added
like
it
was
nothing
that
the
pigs
downtown
were
offlimits
to
us
there
was
a
lot
of
bitterness
about
it
but
what
could
we
do
we
had
no
real
power
it
was
this
young
fellow
a
pfc
named
dick
hallorann
who
was
a
messcook
who
suggested
that
maybe
we
could
fix
it
up
pretty
nice
if
we
really
tried
so
we
did
we
really
tried
and
we
made
out
pretty
well
all
things
considered
the
first
time
a
bunch
of
us
went
in
there
to
look
it
over
we
were
pretty
depressed
it
was
dark
and
smelly
full
of
old
tools
and
boxes
of
papers
that
had
gone
moldy
there
was
only
two
litte
windows
and
no
lectricity
the
floor
was
dirt
carl
roone
laughed
in
a
kind
of
bitter
way
i
remember
that
and
said
the
ole
maje
he
a
real
prince
ain't
he
give
us
our
own
club
sho
and
george
brannock
who
was
also
killed
in
the
fire
that
fall
he
said
yeah
it
a
hell
of
a
black
spot
all
right
and
the
name
just
stuck
hallorann
got
us
going
though
hallorann
and
carl
and
me
i
guess
god
will
forgive
us
for
what
we
did
though
cause
he
knows
we
had
no
idea
how
it
would
turn
out
after
awhile
the
rest
of
the
fellows
pitched
in
with
most
of
derry
offlimits
there
wasn't
much
else
we
could
do
we
hammered
and
nailed
and
cleaned
trev
dawson
was
a
pretty
good
jackleg
carpenter
and
he
showed
us
how
to
cut
some
more
windows
along
the
side
and
damned
if
alan
snopes
didn't
come
up
with
panes
of
glass
for
them
that
were
different
colors
sort
of
a
cross
between
carnival
glass
and
the
sort
you
see
in
church
windows
where'd
you
get
this
i
asked
him
alan
was
the
oldest
of
us
he
was
about
fortytwo
old
enough
so
that
most
of
us
called
him
pop
snopes
he
stuck
a
camel
in
his
mouth
and
tipped
me
a
wink
midnight
requisitions
he
says
and
would
say
no
more
so
the
place
come
along
pretty
good
and
by
the
middle
of
the
summer
we
was
using
it
trev
dawson
and
some
of
the
others
had
partitioned
off
the
back
quarter
of
the
building
and
got
a
little
kitchen
set
up
in
there
not
much
more
than
a
grill
and
a
couple
of
deepfryers
so
that
you
could
get
a
hamburg
and
some
french
fries
if
you
wanted
there
was
a
bar
down
one
side
but
it
was
just
meant
for
sodas
and
drinks
like
virgin
marys
shit
we
knew
our
place
hadn't
we
been
taught
it
if
we
wanted
to
drink
hard
we'd
do
it
in
the
dark
the
floor
was
still
dirt
but
we
kept
it
oiled
down
nice
trev
and
pop
snopes
ran
in
a
lectric
line
more
midnight
requisitions
i
imagine
by
july
you
could
go
in
there
any
saturday
night
and
sit
down
and
have
a
cola
and
a
hamburger
or
a
slawdog
it
was
nice
it
never
really
got
finished
we
was
still
working
on
it
when
the
fire
burned
it
down
it
got
to
be
a
kind
of
hobby
or
a
way
of
thumbing
our
noses
at
fuller
and
mueller
and
the
town
council
but
i
guess
we
knew
it
was
ours
when
ev
mccaslin
and
i
put
up
a
sign
one
friday
night
that
said
the
black
spot
and
just
below
that
company
e
and
guests
like
we
were
exclusive
you
know
tt
got
looking
nice
enough
that
the
white
boys
started
to
grumble
about
it
and
next
thing
you
know
the
white
boy
nco
was
looking
finer
than
ever
they
was
adding
on
a
special
lounge
and
a
little
cafeteria
it
was
like
they
wanted
to
race
but
that
was
one
race
that
we
didn't
want
to
run
my
dad
smiled
at
me
from
his
hospital
bed
we
were
young
except
for
snopesy
but
we
weren't
entirely
foolish
we
knew
that
the
white
boys
let
you
race
against
them
but
if
it
starts
to
look
like
you
are
getting
ahead
why
somebody
just
breaks
your
legs
so
you
can't
run
as
fast
we
had
what
we
wanted
and
that
was
enough
but
then
something
happened
he
fell
silent
frowning
what
was
that
daddy
we
found
out
that
we
had
a
pretty
decent
jazzband
among
us
he
said
slowly
martin
devereaux
who
was
a
corporal
played
drums
ace
stevenson
played
cornet
pop
snopes
phyed
a
pretty
decent
barrelhouse
piano
he
wasn't
great
but
he
wasn't
no
slouch
either
there
was
another
fellow
who
played
clarinet
and
george
brannock
played
the
saxophone
there
were
others
of
us
who
sat
in
from
time
to
time
playing
guitar
or
harmonica
or
juiceharp
or
even
just
a
comb
with
waxed
paper
over
it
this
didn't
all
happen
at
once
you
understand
but
by
the
end
of
that
august
there
was
a
pretty
hot
little
dixieland
combo
playing
friday
and
saturday
nights
at
the
black
spot
they
got
better
and
better
as
the
fall
drew
on
and
while
they
were
never
great
i
don't
want
to
give
you
that
idea
they
played
in
a
way
that
was
different
hotter
somehow
it
he
waved
his
skinny
hand
above
the
bedclothes
they
played
bodacious
i
suggested
grinning
that
right
he
exclaimed
grinning
back
you
got
it
they
played
bodacious
dixieland
and
the
next
thing
you
know
people
from
town
started
to
show
up
at
our
club
even
some
of
the
white
soldiers
from
the
base
it
got
so
the
place
was
getting
crowded
a
right
smart
every
weekend
that
didn't
happen
all
at
once
either
at
first
those
white
faces
looked
like
sprinkles
of
salt
in
a
pepperpot
but
more
and
more
of
them
turned
up
as
time
went
on
when
those
white
people
showed
up
that
when
we
forgot
to
be
careful
they
were
bringin
in
their
own
booze
in
brown
bags
most
of
it
the
finest
hightension
stuff
there
is
made
the
stuff
you
could
get
in
the
pigs
downtown
look
like
soda
pop
countryclub
booze
is
what
i
mean
mikey
rich
people
booze
chivas
glenfiddich
the
kind
of
champagne
they
served
to
firstclass
passengers
on
ocean
liners
champers
some
of
em
called
it
same
as
we
used
to
call
uglyminded
mules
back
home
we
should
have
found
a
way
to
stop
it
but
we
didn't
know
how
they
was
town
hell
they
was
white
and
like
i
said
we
were
young
and
proud
of
what
we'd
done
and
we
underestimated
how
bad
things
might
get
we
all
knew
that
mueller
and
his
friends
must
have
known
what
was
going
on
but
i
don't
think
any
of
us
realized
that
it
was
drivin
em
crazy
and
i
mean
what
i
say
crazy
there
they
were
in
their
grand
old
victorian
houses
on
west
broadway
not
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
from
where
we
were
listening
to
things
like
aunt
hagar
blues
and
diggin
my
potatoes
that
was
bad
knowing
that
their
young
people
were
there
too
whooping
it
up
right
cheek
by
jowl
with
the
blacks
that
must
have
been
ever
so
much
worse
because
it
wasn't
just
the
lumberjacks
and
the
barbags
that
were
turning
up
as
september
came
into
october
it
got
to
be
kind
of
a
thing
in
town
young
folks
would
come
to
drink
and
to
dance
to
that
noname
jazzband
until
one
in
the
morning
came
and
shut
us
down
they
didn't
just
come
from
derry
either
they
come
from
bangor
and
newport
and
haven
and
cleaves
mills
and
old
town
and
all
the
little
burgs
around
these
parts
you
could
see
fraternity
boys
from
the
university
of
maine
at
orono
cutting
capers
with
their
sorority
girlfriends
and
when
the
band
learned
how
to
play
a
ragtime
version
of
the
maine
stein
song
they
just
about
ripped
the
roof
off
of
course
it
was
an
enlistedmen
club
technically
at
least
and
offlimits
to
civilians
who
didn't
have
an
invitation
but
in
fact
mikey
we
just
opened
the
door
at
seven
and
let
her
stand
open
until
one
by
the
middle
of
october
it
got
so
that
any
time
you
went
out
on
the
dancefloor
you
were
standing
hip
to
hip
with
six
other
people
there
wasn't
no
room
to
dance
so
you
had
to
just
sort
of
stand
there
and
wiggle
but
if
anyone
minded
i
never
heard
him
let
on
by
midnight
it
was
like
an
empty
freightcar
rocking
and
reeling
on
an
express
run
he
paused
took
another
drink
of
water
and
then
went
on
his
eyes
were
bright
now
well
well
fuller
would
have
put
an
end
to
it
sooner
or
later
if
it
had
been
sooner
a
lot
less
people
would
have
died
all
you
had
to
do
was
send
in
mps
and
have
them
confiscate
all
the
bottles
of
liquor
that
people
had
brought
in
with
them
that
would
have
been
good
enough
just
what
he
wanted
in
fact
it
would
have
shut
us
down
good
and
proper
there
would
have
been
courtmartials
and
the
stockade
in
rye
for
some
of
us
and
transfers
for
all
the
rest
but
fuller
was
slow
i
think
he
was
afraid
of
the
same
thing
some
of
us
was
afraid
of
that
some
of
the
townies
would
be
mad
mueller
hadn't
been
back
to
see
him
and
i
think
major
fuller
must
have
been
scared
to
go
downtown
and
see
mueller
he
talked
big
fuller
did
but
he
had
all
the
spine
of
a
jellyfish
so
instead
of
the
thing
ending
in
some
putup
way
that
would
have
at
least
left
all
those
that
burned
up
that
night
still
alive
the
legion
of
decency
ended
it
they
came
in
their
white
sheets
early
that
november
and
cooked
themselves
a
barbecue
he
fell
silent
again
not
sipping
at
his
water
this
time
only
looking
moodily
into
the
far
comer
of
his
room
while
outside
a
bell
dinged
softly
somewhere
and
a
nurse
passed
the
open
doorway
the
soles
of
her
shoes
squeaking
on
the
linoleum
i
could
hear
a
tv
someplace
a
radio
someplace
else
i
remember
that
i
could
hear
the
wind
blowing
outside
snuffling
up
the
side
of
the
building
and
although
it
was
august
the
wind
made
a
cold
sound
it
knew
nothing
of
cain
hundred
on
the
television
or
the
four
seasons
singing
walk
like
ama
on
the
radio
some
of
them
came
through
that
greenbelt
between
the
base
and
west
broadway
he
resumed
at
last
they
must
have
met
at
someone
house
over
there
maybe
in
the
basement
to
get
their
sheets
on
and
to
make
the
torches
that
they
used
tve
heard
that
others
came
right
onto
the
base
by
ridgeline
road
which
was
the
main
way
onto
the
base
back
then
i
heard
i
won't
say
where
that
they
came
in
a
brandnew
packard
automobile
dressed
in
their
white
sheets
with
their
white
goblinhats
on
their
laps
and
torches
on
the
floor
the
torches
were
louisville
sluggers
with
big
hunks
of
burlap
snugged
down
over
the
fat
parts
with
red
rubber
gaskets
the
kind
ladies
use
when
they
put
up
preserves
there
was
a
booth
where
ridgeline
road
branched
off
witcham
road
and
came
onto
the
base
and
the
od
passed
that
packard
night
along
tt
was
saturday
night
and
the
joint
was
jumping
going
round
and
round
there
might
have
been
two
hundred
people
there
maybe
three
and
here
came
these
white
nen
six
or
eight
in
their
bottle
green
packard
and
more
coining
through
the
trees
between
the
base
and
the
fancy
houses
on
west
broadway
they
wasn't
young
not
many
of
them
and
sometimes
i
wonder
how
many
cases
of
angina
and
bleeding
ulcers
there
were
he
next
day
i
hope
there
was
a
lot
those
dirty
sneaking
murdering
bastards
the
packard
parked
on
the
hill
and
flashed
its
lights
twice
about
four
men
got
out
of
it
and
joined
the
rest
some
had
those
two
gallon
tins
of
gasoline
that
you
could
buy
at
service
stations
back
in
those
days
all
of
them
had
torches
one
of
em
stayed
behind
the
wheel
of
that
packard
mueller
had
a
packard
you
know
yes
he
did
a
green
one
they
got
together
at
the
back
of
the
black
spot
and
doused
their
torches
with
gas
maybe
they
only
meant
to
scare
us
i've
heard
it
the
other
way
but
i've
heard
it
that
way
too
i'd
rather
believe
that
how
they
meant
it
because
i
ain't
got
feeling
mean
enough
even
yet
to
want
to
believe
the
worst
it
could
have
been
that
he
gas
dripped
down
to
the
handles
of
some
of
those
torches
and
when
they
lit
them
why
those
holding
them
panicked
and
threw
them
any
whichway
just
to
get
rid
of
them
whatever
that
black
november
night
was
suddenly
blazing
with
torches
some
was
holding
em
up
and
waving
em
around
little
flaming
pieces
of
burlap
falling
off
n
the
tops
of
em
some
of
them
were
laughing
but
like
i
say
some
of
the
others
up
and
threw
em
through
the
back
windows
into
what
was
our
kitchen
the
place
was
burning
merry
hell
in
a
minute
and
a
half
the
men
outside
they
were
all
wearing
their
peaky
white
hoods
by
then
some
of
them
were
chanting
come
out
niggers
come
out
niggers
come
out
niggers
maybe
some
of
them
were
chanting
to
scare
us
but
i
like
to
believe
most
of
em
were
trying
to
warn
us
same
way
as
i
like
to
believe
that
maybe
those
torches
going
into
the
kitchen
the
way
they
did
was
an
accident
either
way
it
didn't
much
matter
the
band
was
playing
louder'n
a
factory
whistle
everybody
was
whooping
it
up
and
having
a
good
time
nobody
inside
knew
anything
was
wrong
until
gerry
mccrew
who
was
playing
assistant
cook
that
night
opened
the
door
to
the
kitchen
and
damn
near
got
blowtorched
flames
shot
out
ten
feet
and
burned
his
messjacket
right
off
burned
most
of
his
hair
off
as
well
i
was
sitting
about
halfway
down
the
east
wall
with
trev
dawson
and
dick
hallorann
when
it
happened
and
at
first
i
had
an
idea
the
gas
stove
had
exploded
i'd
no
more
than
got
on
my
feet
when
i
was
knocked
down
by
people
headed
for
the
door
about
two
dozen
of
em
went
marchin
right
up
my
back
an
i
guess
that
was
the
only
time
during
the
whole
thing
when
i
really
felt
scared
i
could
hear
people
screamin
and
tellin
each
other
they
had
to
get
out
the
place
was
on
fire
but
every
time
i
tried
to
get
up
someone
footed
me
right
back
down
again
someone
landed
his
big
shoe
square
on
the
back
of
my
head
and
i
saw
stars
my
nose
mashed
on
that
oiled
floor
and
i
snuffled
up
dirt
and
began
to
cough
and
sneeze
at
the
same
time
someone
else
stepped
on
the
small
of
my
back
i
felt
a
lady
high
heel
slam
down
between
the
cheeks
of
my
butt
and
son
i
never
want
another
halfass
enema
like
that
one
if
the
seat
of
my
khakis
had
ripped
i
believe
i'd
be
bleedin
down
there
to
this
day
tt
sounds
funny
now
but
i
damn
near
died
in
that
stampede
i
was
whopped
whapped
stomped
walked
on
and
kicked
in
so
many
places
i
couldn't
walk
tall
the
next
day
i
was
screaming
and
none
of
those
people
topside
heard
me
or
paid
any
mind
tt
was
trev
saved
me
i
seen
this
big
brown
hand
in
front
of
me
and
i
grabbed
it
like
a
drownin
man
grabs
a
life
preserver
i
grabbed
and
he
hauled
and
up
i
came
someone
foot
got
me
in
the
side
of
my
neck
right
here
he
massaged
that
area
where
the
jaw
turns
up
toward
the
ear
and
i
nodded
and
it
hurt
so
bad
that
i
guess
i
blacked
out
for
a
minute
but
i
never
let
go
of
trev
hand
and
he
never
let
go
of
mine
i
got
to
my
feet
finally
just
as
the
wall
we'd
put
up
between
the
kitchen
and
the
hall
fell
over
it
made
a
noise
like
floomp
the
noise
a
puddle
of
gasoline
makes
when
you
light
it
i
saw
it
go
over
in
a
big
bundle
of
sparks
and
i
saw
the
people
running
to
get
out
of
its
way
as
it
fell
some
of
em
made
it
some
didnt
one
of
our
fellas
i
think
it
might
have
been
hort
sartoris
was
buried
under
it
and
for
just
one
second
i
seen
his
hand
underneath
all
those
blazing
coals
openin
and
closin
there
was
a
white
girl
surely
no
more
than
twenty
and
the
back
of
her
dress
went
up
she
was
with
a
college
boy
and
i
heard
her
screamin
at
him
beggin
him
to
help
her
he
took
just
about
two
swipes
at
it
and
then
ran
away
with
the
others
she
stood
there
screamin
as
her
dress
went
up
on
her
it
was
like
hell
out
where
the
kitchen
had
been
the
flames
was
so
bright
you
couldn't
look
at
them
the
heat
was
bakin
hot
mikey
roastin

you
could
feel
your
skin
going
shiny
you
could
feel
the
hairs
in
your
nose
gettin
crispy
we
gotta
break
outta
here
trev
yells
and
starts
to
drag
me
along
the
wall
come
on
then
dick
hallorann
catches
hold
of
him
he
couldn't
have
been
no
more
than
nineteen
and
his
eyes
was
as
big
as
bil'ard
balls
but
he
kept
his
head
better
than
we
did
he
saved
our
lives
not
that
way
he
yells
this
way
and
he
pointed
back
toward
the
bandstand
toward
the
fire
you
know
you're
crazy
trevor
screamed
back
he
had
a
big
bull
voice
but
you
could
barely
hear
him
over
the
thunder
of
the
fire
and
the
screaming
people
die
if
you
want
to
but
me
and
willy
are
gettin
out
he
still
had
me
by
the
hand
and
he
started
to
haul
me
toward
the
door
again
although
there
were
so
many
people
around
it
by
then
you
couldn't
see
it
at
all
i
would
have
gone
with
him
i
was
so
shell
shocked
i
didn't
know
what
end
was
up
all
i
knew
was
that
i
didn't
want
to
be
baked
like
a
human
turkey
dick
grabbed
trev
by
the
hair
of
the
head
just
as
hard
as
he
could
and
when
trev
turned
back
dick
slapped
his
face
i
remember
seeing
trev
head
bounce
off.the
wall
and
thinking
dick
had
gone
crazy
then
he
was
hollerin
in
trev’s
face
you
go
that
way
and
you
goan
die
they
jammed
up
against
that
door
nigger
you
don't
know
that
trev
screamed
back
at
him
and
then
there
was
this
loud
bang\
like
a
firecracker
only
what
it
was
it
was
the
heat
exploding
marty
devereaux
bass
drum
the
fire
was
runnin
along
the
beams
overhead
and
the
oil
on
the
floor
was
catchin
i
know
it
dick
screams
back
i
know
it
he
grabbed
my
other
land
and
for
a
minute
there
i
felt
like
the
rope
in
a
tugo
war
game
then
trev
took
a
good
look
at
the
door
and
went
dick
way
dick
got
us
down
to
a
window
and
grabbed
a
chair
to
bust
it
out
but
before
he
could
swing
it
the
heat
blew
it
out
for
him
then
he
grabbed
trev
dawson
by
the
back
of
his
pants
and
hauled
him
up
climb
he
shouts
climb
motherfucker
and
trev
went
head
up
and
tail
over
the
dashboard
he
boosted
me
next
and
i
went
up
i
grabbed
the
sides
of
the
window
and
hauled
i
had
a
good
crop
of
blisters
all
over
my
palms
the
next
day
that
wood
was
already
smokin
i
come
out
headfirst
and
if
trev
hadn't
grabbed
me
i
mighta
broke
my
neck
we
turned
back
around
and
it
was
like
something
from
the
worst
nightmare
you
ever
had
mikey
that
window
was
just
a
yellow
blazin
square
of
light
flames
was
shoo
tin
up
through
that
tin
roof
in
a
dozen
places
we
could
hear
people
screamin
inside
i
saw
two
brown
hands
waving
around
in
front
of
the
fire
dick
hands
trev
dawson
made
me
a
step
with
his
own
hands
and
i
reached
through
that
window
and
grabbed
dick
when
i
took
his
weight
my
gut
went
against
the
side
of
the
building
and
it
was
like
having
your
belly
against
a
stove
that
just
starting
to
get
real
good
and
hot
dick
face
came
up
and
for
a
few
seconds
i
didn't
think
we
was
going
to
be
able
to
get
him
he'd
taken
a
right
smart
of
smoke
and
he
was
close
to
passing
out
his
lips
had
cracked
open
the
back
of
his
shirt
was
smoldering
and
then
i
damn
near
let
go
tecause
i
could
smell
the
people
burning
inside
i've
heard
people
say
that
smell
is
like
barbecuing
pork
ribs
but
it
ain't
like
that
it
more
like
what
happens
sometimes
after
they
geld
hosses
they
build
a
big
fire
and
throw
all
that
shit
into
it
and
when
the
fire
gets
hot
enough
you
can
hear
them
hossballs
poppin
like
chestnuts
and
that
what
people
smell
like
when
they
start
to
cook
right
inside
their
clo'es
i
could
smell
that
and
i
knew
i
couldn't
take
it
for
long
so
i
gave
one
more
great
big
yank
and
out
came
dick
he
lost
one
of
his
shoes
tumbled
off
trev
hands
and
went
down
dick
come
down
on
top
of
me
and
i'm
here
to
tell
you
that
nigger
head
was
hard
i
lost
most
of
my
breath
and
just
laid
there
on
the
dirt
for
a
few
seconds
rolling
around
and
holding
my
bellyguts
presently
i
was
able
to
get
to
my
knees
then
to
my
feet
and
i
seen
these
shapes
running
off
toward
the
greenbelt
at
first
i
thought
they
were
ghosts
and
then
i
seen
shoes
by
then
it
was
so
bright
around
the
back
spot
it
was
like
daylight
i
seen
shoes
and
understood
it
was
men
wearin
sheets
one
of
them
had
fallen
a
little
bit
behind
the
others
and
i
saw
he
trailed
off
licking
his
lips
what
did
you
see
daddy
i
asked
never
you
mind
he
said
give
me
my
water
mikey
i
did
he
drank
most
of
it
and
then
got
coughing
a
passing
nurse
looked
in
and
said
do
you
need
anything
mr
hanlon
new
set
of
testines
my
dad
said
you
got
any
handy
rhoda
she
smiled
a
nervous
doubtful
smile
and
passed
on
my
dad
handed
the
glass
to
me
and
i
put
it
back
on
his
table
it
longer
tellin
than
it
is
rememberin
he
said
you
goan
fill
that
glass
up
for
me
before
you
leave
sure
daddy
this
story
goan
give
you
nightmares
mikey
i
opened
my
mouth
to
lie
and
then
thought
better
of
it
and
i
think
now
that
if
i
had
lied
he
would
have
stopped
right
there
he
was
far
gone
by
then
but
maybe
not
that
far
gone
i
guess
s
i
said
that
not
such
a
bad
thing
he
said
to
me
in
nightmares
we
can
think
the
worst
that
what
they're
for
i
guess
he
reached
out
his
hand
and
i
took
it
and
we
held
hands
while
he
finished
looked
around
just
in
time
to
see
trev
and
dick
goin
around
the
front
of
the
building
and
i
chased
after
them
still
trying
to
catch
m'wind
there
was
maybe
forty
or
fifty
people
out
there
some
of
them
cryin
some
of
them
pukin
some
of
them
screamin
some
of
them
doing
all
three
things
at
once
it
seemed
like
others
were
layin
on
the
grass
fainted
dead
away
with
the
smoke
the
door
was
shut
and
we
heard
people
screamin
on
the
other
side
screamin
to
let
them
out
out
for
the
love
of
jesus
they
were
burning
up
tt
was
the
only
door
except
for
the
one
that
went
out
through
the
kitchen
to
where
the
garbage
cans
and
things
were
you
see
to
go
in
you
pushed
the
door
open
to
go
out
you
had
to
pull
it
some
people
had
gotten
out
and
then
they
started
to
jam
up
at
that
door
and
push
the
door
got
slammed
shut
the
ones
in
the
back
kept
pushin
forward
to
get
away
from
the
fire
and
everybody
got
jammed
up
the
ones
right
up
front
were
squashed
wasn't
no
way
they
could
get
that
door
open
against
the
weight
of
all
those
behind
so
there
they
were
trapped
and
the
fire
raged
tt
was
trev
dawson
that
made
it
so
it
was
only
eighty
or
so
that
died
instead
of
a
hundred
or
maybe
two
hundred
and
what
he
got
for
his
pains
wasn't
a
medal
but
two
years
in
the
rye
stockade
see
right
about
then
this
big
old
cargo
truck
pulled
up
and
who
should
be
behind
the
wheel
but
my
old
friend
sergeant
wilson
the
fella
who
owned
all
the
holes
there
on
the
base
he
gets
out
and
starts
shoutin
orders
that
didn't
make
much
sense
and
which
people
couldn't
hear
anyway
trev
grabbed
my
arm
and
we
run
over
to
him
i'd
lost
all
track
of
dick
hallorann
by
then
and
didn't
even
see
him
until
the
next
day
sergeant
i
have
to
use
your
truck
trev
yells
in
his
face
get
out
of
my
way
nigger
wilson
says
and
pushes
him
down
then
he
starts
yelling
all
that
confused
shit
again
wasn't
nobody
paying
any
attention
to
him
and
he
didn't
go
on
for
long
anyway
because
trevor
dawson
popped
up
like
a
jackinthebox
and
decked
him
trev
could
hit
damned
hard
and
almost
any
other
man
would
have
stayed
down
but
that
cracker
had
a
hard
head
he
got
up
blood
pouring
out
of
his
mouth
and
nose
and
he
said
im
goan
kill
you
for
that
well
trev
hit
him
in
the
belly
just
as
hard
as
he
could
and
when
he
doubled
over
i
put
my
hands
together
and
pounded
the
back
of
his
neck
just
as
hard
as
could
it
was
a
cowardly
thing
to
do
hitting
a
man
from
behind
like
that
but
desperate
times
call
for
desperate
measures
and
i
would
be
lyin
mikey
if
i
didn't
tell
you
that
hitting
that
poormouth
sonofabitch
didn't
give
me
a
bit
of
pleasure
down
he
went
just
like
a
steer
hit
with
a
poleaxe
trev
run
to
the
truck
fired
it
up
and
drove
it
around
so
it
was
facin
the
front
of
the
black
spot
but
to
the
left
of
the
door
he
th'owed
it
into
first
popped
the
clutch
on
that
cocksucker
and
here
he
come
look
out
there
shouted
at
that
crowd
of
people
standing
around
ware
that
truck
they
scattered
like
quail
and
for
a
wonder
trev
didn't
hit
none
of
em
he
hit
the
side
of
the
buildng
going
maybe
thirty
and
cracked
his
face
a
good
one
on
the
steerin
wheel
of
the
truck
i
seen
the
blood
fly
from
his
nose
when
he
shook
his
head
to
clear
it
he
punched
out
reverse
backed
up
fifty
yards
and
come
down
on
her
again
wham
the
black
spot
wasn't
nothing
but
corrugated
tin
and
that
second
hit
did
her
the
whole
side
of
that
oven
fell
in
and
the
flames
come
roarin
out
how
anything
could
have
still
been
alive
in
there
i
don't
know
but
there
was
people
are
a
lot
tougher
than
you'd
believe
mikey
and
if
you
don't
believe
it
just
take
a
look
at
me
slidin
off
the
skin
of
the
world
by
my
fingernails
that
place
was
like
a
smelting
furnace
it
was
a
hell
of
flames
and
smoke
but
people
came
running
out
in
a
regular
torrent
there
were
so
many
that
trev
didn't
even
dare
back
the
truck
up
again
for
fear
he
would
run
over
some
of
them
so
he
got
out
and
ran
back
to
me
leaving
it
where
it
was
we
stood
there
watching
it
end
it
hadn't
been
five
minutes
all
told
but
xxxit
felt
like
forever
the
last
dozen
or
so
that
made
it
out
were
on
fire
people
grabbed
em
and
started
to
roll
em
around
on
the
ground
trying
to
put
em
out
looking
in
we
could
see
other
people
trying
to
come
and
we
knew
they
wasn't
never
going
to
make
it
trev
grabbed
my
hand
and
i
grabbed
him
back
twice
as
hard
we
stood
there
holding
hands
just
like
you
and
me
are
doing
now
mikey
him
with
his
nose
broke
and
blood
running
down
his
face
and
his
eyes
puffing
shut
and
we
watched
them
people
they
were
the
real
ghosts
we
saw
that
night
nothing
but
shimmers
shaped
like
men
and
women
in
that
fire
walking
toward
the
opening
trev
had
bashed
with
sergeant
wilson
truck
some
of
em
had
their
arms
held
out
like
they
expected
someone
to
save
them
the
others
just
walked
but
they
didn't
seem
to
get
nowhere
their
clo'es
were
blazin
their
faces
were
runnin
and
one
after
another
they
just
toppled
over
and
you
didn't
see
them
no
more
the
last
one
was
a
woman
her
dress
had
burned
off
her
and
there
she
was
in
her
slip
she
was
burnin
like
a
candle
she
seemed
to
look
right
at
me
at
the
end
and
i
seen
her
eyelids
was
on
fire
when
she
fell
down
it
was
over
the
whole
place
went
up
in
a
pillar
of
fire
by
the
time
the
base
firetrucks
and
two
more
from
the
main
street
fire
station
got
there
it
was
already
burning
itself
out
that
was
the
fire
at
the
black
spot
mikey
he
drank
the
last
of
his
water
and
handed
me
the
glass
to
fill
at
the
drinking
fountain
in
the
hall
goan
piss
the
bed
tonight
i
guess
mikey
i
kissed
his
cheek
and
then
went
out
into
the
hall
to
fill
his
glass
when
i
returned
he
was
drifting
away
again
his
eyes
glassy
and
contemplative
when
i
put
the
glass
on
the
nighttable
he
mumbled
a
thankyou
i
could
barely
understand
i
looked
at
the
westclox
on
his
table
and
saw
it
was
almost
eight
time
for
me
to
go
home
i
leaned
over
to
kiss
him
goodbye
and
instead
heard
myself
whisper
what
did
you
see
his
eyes
which
were
now
slipping
shut
barely
turned
toward
the
sound
of
my
wice
he
might
have
known
it
was
me
or
he
might
have
believed
he
was
hearing
the
voice
of
his
own
thoughts
hun
the
thing
you
sa
i
whispered
i
didn't
want
to
hear
but
i
had
to
hear
i
was
both
hot
and
cold
my
eyes
burning
my
hands
freezing
but
i
had
to
hear
as
i
suppose
lot
wife
had
to
turn
back
and
look
at
the
destruction
of
sodom
twas
a
bird
he
said
right
over
the
last
of
those
runnin
men
a
hawk
maybe
what
they
call
a
kestrel
but
it
was
big
never
told
no
one
would
have
been
locked
up
that
bird
was
maybe
sixty
feet
from
wingtip
to
wingtip
it
was
the
size
of
a
japanese
zero
but
i
seen
seen
its
eyes
and
i
think
it
seen
me
his
head
slipped
over
to
the
side
toward
the
window
where
the
dark
was
coming
tt
swooped
down
and
grabbed
that
last
man
up
got
him
right
by
the
sheet
it
did
xxxand
i
heard
that
bird
wings
the
sound
was
like
fire
and
it
hovered
and
i
thought
birds
can't
hover
but
this
one
could
because
because
he
fell
silent
why
daddy
i
whispered
why
could
it
hover
tt
didn't
hover
he
said
i
sat
there
in
silence
thinking
he
had
gone
to
sleep
for
sure
this
time
i
had
never
been
so
afraid
in
my
life
because
four
years
before
i
had
seen
that
bird
somehow
in
some
unimaginable
way
i
had
nearly
forgotten
that
nightmare
it
was
my
father
who
brought
it
back
tt
didn't
hover
he
said
tt
floated
it
floated
there
were
big
bunches
of
balloons
tied
to
each
wing
and
it
floated
my
father
went
to
sleep
march
ist
it
come
again
i
know
that
now
i'll
wait
but
in
my
heart
i
know
it
i'm
not
sure
i
can
stand
it
as
a
kid
i
was
able
to
deal
with
it
but
it
different
with
kids
in
some
fundamental
way
it
different
i
wrote
all
of
that
last
might
in
a
kind
of
frenzy
not
that
i
could
have
gone
home
anyway
derry
has
been
blanketed
in
a
thick
glaze
of
ice
and
although
the
sun
is
out
this
morning
nothing
is
moving
i
wrote
until
long
after
three
this
morning
pushing
the
pen
faster
and
faster
trying
to
get
it
all
out
i
had
forgotten
about
seeing
the
giant
bird
when
i
was
eleven
it
was
my
father
story
that
brought
it
back
and
i
never
forgot
it
again
not
any
of
it
in
a
way
i
suppose
it
was
his
final
gift
to
me
a
terrible
gift
you
would
say
but
wonderful
in
its
way
i
slept
right
where
i
was
my
head
in
my
arms
my
notebook
and
pen
on
the
table
in
front
of
me
i
woke
up
this
morning
with
a
numb
ass
and
an
aching
back
but
feeling
free
somehow
purged
of
that
old
story
and
then
i
saw
that
i
had
had
company
in
the
night
as
i
slept
the
tracks
drying
to
faint
muddy
impressions
led
from
the
front
door
of
the
library
which
i
locked
i
always
lock
it
to
the
desk
where
i
slept
there
were
no
tracks
leading
away
whatever
it
was
it
came
to
me
in
the
might
left
its
talisman
and
then
simply
disappeared
tied
to
my
reading
lamp
was
a
single
balloon
filled
with
helium
it
floated
in
a
moming
sunray
which
slanted
in
through
one
of
the
high
windows
on
it
was
a
picture
of
my
face
the
eyes
gone
blood
running
down
from
the
ragged
sockets
a
scream
distorting
the
mouth
on
the
balloon
thin
and
bulging
rubber
skin
i
looked
at
it
and
i
screamed
the
scream
echoed
through
the
library
echoing
back
vibrating
from
the
circular
iron
staircase
leading
to
the
stacks
the
balloon
burst
with
a
bang
part
grownups
the
descent
made
up
of
despairs
and
without
accomplishment
realizes
a
new
awakening
which
is
a
reversal
of
despair
for
what
we
cannot
accomplish
what
is
denied
to
love
what
we
have
lost
in
the
anticipation
a
descent
follows
endless
and
indestructible

chapter
the
reunion
bill
denbrough
gets
a
cab
the
telephone
was
ringing
bringing
him
up
and
out
of
a
sleep
too
deep
for
dreams
he
groped
for
it
without
opening
his
eyes
without
coming
more
than
halfway
awake
if
it
had
stopped
ringing
just
then
he
would
have
slipped
back
down
into
sleep
without
a
hitch
he
would
have
done
i
as
simply
and
easily
as
he
had
once
slipped
down
the
snowcovered
hills
in
mccarron
park
on
his
flexible
flyer
you
ran
with
the
sled
threw
yourself
onto
it
and
down
you
went
seemingly
at
the
speed
of
sound
you
couldn't
do
that
as
a
grownup
it
racked
the
hell
out
of
your
balls
his
fingers
walked
over
the
telephone
dial
slipped
off
climbed
it
again
he
had
a
dim
premonition
that
it
would
be
mike
hanlon
mike
hanlon
calling
from
derry
telling
him
he
had
to
come
back
telling
him
he
had
to
remember
telling
him
they
had
made
a
promise
stan
uris
had
cut
their
palms
with
a
sliver
of
coke
bottle
and
they
had
made
a
promise
except
all
of
that
had
already
happened
he
had
gotten
in
late
yesterday
afternoon
just
before
p.m
actually
he
supposed
that
if
he
had
been
the
last
call
on
mike
list
all
of
them
must
have
gotten
in
at
varying
times
some
might
even
have
spent
most
of
the
day
here
he
himself
had
seen
none
of
them
felt
no
urge
to
see
any
of
them
he
had
simply
checked
in
gone
up
to
his
room
ordered
a
meal
from
room
service
which
he
found
he
could
not
eat
once
it
was
laid
out
before
him
and
then
had
tumbled
into
bed
and
slept
dreamlessly
until
now
bill
cracked
one
eye
open
and
fumbled
for
the
telephone
handset
it
fell
off
onto
the
table
and
he
groped
for
it
opening
his
other
eye
he
felt
totally
blank
inside
his
head
totally
unplugged
running
on
batteries
he
finally
managed
to
scoop
up
the
phone
he
got
up
on
one
elbow
and
put
it
against
his
ear
hell
bill
it
was
mike
hanlon
voice
he'd
had
at
least
that
much
right
last
week
he
didn't
remember
mike
at
all
and
now
a
single
word
was
enough
to
identify
him
it
was
rather
marvellous
but
in
an
ominous
way
yeah
mike
woke
you
up
huh
yeah
you
did
that
okay
on
the
wall
above
the
tv
was
an
abysmal
painting
of
lobstermen
in
yelow
slickers
and
rainhats
pulling
lobster
traps
looking
at
it
bill
remembered
where
he
was
the
derry
town
house
on
upper
main
street
half
a
mile
farther
up
and
across
the
street
was
bassey
park
the
kissing
bridge
the
canal
what
time
is
it
mike
quarter
of
ten
what
day
the
th
mike
sounded
a
little
amused
yeah
kay
tve
arranged
a
little
reunion
mike
said
he
sounded
diffident
now
yeah
bill
swung
his
legs
out
of
bed
they
all
came
all
but
stan
uris
mike
said
now
there
was
something
in
his
voice
that
bill
couldn't
read
bev
was
the
last
one
she
got
in
late
last
evening
why
do
you
say
the
last
one
mike
stan
might
show
up
today
bill
stan
dead
what
how
did
his
plane
nothing
like
that
mike
said
look
if
it
all
the
same
to
you
i
think
it
ought
to
wait
until
we
get
together
it
would
be
better
if
i
could
tell
all
of
you
at
the
same
time
tt
has
to
do
with
this
yes
i
think
so
mike
paused
briefly
i'm
sure
it
does
bill
felt
the
familiar
weight
of
dread
settle
around
his
heart
again
was
it
something
you
could
get
used
to
so
quickly
then
or
had
it
been
something
he
had
carried
all
along
simply
unfelt
and
unthought
of
like
the
inevitable
fact
of
his
own
death
he
reached
for
his
cigarettes
lit
one
and
blew
out
the
match
with
the
first
drag
none
of
them
got
together
yesterday
no
i
don't
believe
so
and
you
haven't
seen
any
of
us
yet
no
just
talked
to
you
on
the
phone
okay
he
said
where
the
reunion
you
remember
where
the
old
ironworks
used
to
be
pasture
road
sure
you're
behind
the
times
old
chum
that
mall
road
these
days
we've
got
the
third
biggest
shopping
mall
in
the
state
out
there
fortyeight
different
merchants
under
one
roof
for
your
shopping
convenience
sounds
really
aa
american
all
right
bill
what
you
all
right
yes
but
his
heart
was
beating
too
fast
the
tip
of
his
cigarette
jittering
atiny
bit
he
had
stuttered
mike
had
heard
it
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
and
then
mike
said
just
out
past
the
mall
there
a
restaurant
called
jade
of
the
orient
they
have
private
rooms
for
parties
i
arranged
for
one
of
them
yesterday
we
can
have
it
the
whole
afternoon
if
we
want
it
you
think
this
might
take
that
long
i
just
don't
know
a
cab
will
know
how
to
get
there
sure
all
right
bill
said
he
wrote
the
name
of
the
restaurant
down
on
the
pad
by
the
phone
why
there
because
it
new
i
guess
mike
said
slowly
tt
seemed
like
i
don't
know

neutral
ground
bill
suggested
yes
i
guess
that
it
food
any
good
i
don't
know
mike
said
how
your
appetite
bill
chuffed
out
smoke
and
half
laughed
half
coughed
it
ain't
so
good
ole
pal
yea
mike
said
i
hear
you
noon
more
like
one
i
guess
we'll
let
beverly
catch
a
few
more
z
bill
snuffed
the
cigarette
she
married
mike
hesitated
again
we'll
catch
up
on
everythin
he
said
just
like
when
you
go
back
to
your
highschool
reunion
ten
years
later
huh
bill
said
you
get
to
see
who
got
fat
who
got
bald
who
got
kkids
i
wish
it
was
like
that
mike
said
yeah
me
too
mikey
me
too
he
hung
up
the
phone
took
a
long
shower
and
ordered
a
breakfast
that
le
didn't
want
and
which
he
only
picked
at
no
his
appetite
was
really
not
much
good
at
all
bill
dialed
the
big
yellow
cab
company
and
asked
to
be
picked
up
at
quarter
of
one
thinking
that
fifteen
minutes
would
be
plenty
of
time
to
get
him
out
to
pasture
road
he
found
himself
totally
unable
to
think
of
it
as
mall
road
even
when
he
actually
saw
the
mall
but
he
had
underestimated
the
lunch
hour
traffic
flow
and
how
much
derry
had
grown
in
it
had
been
a
big
town
not
much
more
there
were
maybe
thirty
thousand
people
inside
the
derry
incorporated
city
limits
and
maybe
another
seven
thousand
beyond
that
in
the
surrounding
burgs
now
it
had
become
a
city
a
very
small
city
by
london
or
new
york
standards
but
doing
just
fine
by
maine
standards
where
portland
the
state
largest
could
boast
barely
three
hundred
thousand
as
the
cab
moved
slowly
down
main
street
we're
over
the
canal
now
bill
thought
can't
see
it
but
it
down
there
running
in
the
dark
and
then
turned
up
center
his
first
thought
was
predictable
enough
how
much
had
changed
but
the
predictable
thought
was
accompanied
by
a
deep
dismay
that
he
never
would
have
expected
he
remembered
his
childhood
here
as
a
fearful
nervous
time
not
only
because
of
the
summer
of
when
the
seven
of
them
had
faced
the
terror
but
because
of
george
death
the
deep
dream
his
parents
seemed
to
have
fallen
into
following
that
death
the
constant
ragging
about
his
stutter
bowers
and
huggins
and
criss
constantly
on
the
prod
for
them
after
the
rockfight
in
the
barrens
bowers
and
huggins
and
criss
oh
my
bowers
and
huggins
and
criss
oh
my
and
just
a
feeling
that
derry
was
cold
that
derry
was
hard
that
derry
didn't
much
give
a
shit
if
any
of
them
lived
or
died
and
certainly
not
if
they
triumphed
over
pennywise
the
clown
derry
folk
had
lived
with
pennywise
in
all
his
guises
for
a
long
time
and
maybe
in
some
mad
way
they
had
even
come
to
understand
him
to
like
him
need
him
love
him
maybe
yes
maybe
that
too
so
why
this
dismay
perhaps
only
because
it
seemed
such
dull
change
somehow
or
perhaps
because
derry
seemed
to
have
lost
its
essential
face
for
him
the
bijou
theater
was
gone
replaced
with
a
parking
lot
by
permit
only
the
sign
over
the
ramp
announced
violators
subject
to
tow
the
shoeboat
and
bailley'’s
lunch
which
had
stood
next
to
it
were
also
gone
they
had
been
replaced
by
a
branch
of
the
northern
national
bank
a
digital
readout
jutted
from
the
front
of
the
bland
cinderblock
structure
showing
the
time
and
the
temperature
the
latter
in
both
degrees
fahrenheit
and
degrees
celsius
the
center
street
drug
lair
of
mr
keene
and
the
place
where
bill
had
gotten
eddie
his
asthma
medicine
that
day
was
also
gone
richard
alley
had
become
some
strange
hybrid
called
a
mini
mall
looking
inside
as
the
cab
idled
at
a
stoplight
bill
could
see
a
record
shop
a
naturalfoods
store
and
a
toysandgames
shop
which
was
featuring
a
clearance
sale
on
all
dungeons
and
dragons
supplies
the
cab
pulled
forward
with
a
jerk
gonna
take
awhile
the
driver
said
i
wish

these
goddam
banks
would
stagger
their
lunchhours
pardon

french
if
you're
a
religious
man
that
all
right
bill
said
it
was
overcast
outside
and
ww
a
few
splatters
of
rain
hit
the
cab
windshield
the
radio
muttered
about
an
escaped
mental
patient
from
somewhere
who
was
supposed
to
be
very
dangerous
and
then
began
muttering
about
the
red
sox
who
weren't
showers
early
then
clearing
when
barry
manilow
began
moaning
about
mandy
who
came
and
who
gave
without
taking
the
cabbie
snapped
the
radio
off
bill
asked
when
did
they
go
up
what
the
banks

sixties

they
revitalized
it
just
fine
tore
down
most
the
old
stores
and
put

a
lot
of
banks
and
parking
lots
and

bill
said
grinning

the
cabbie
said
and
they
both
burst
out
laughing

whole
life

in
derry
home
hospital
and

in
mount
hope

bill
said
yeah
right
the
cabbie
said
he
hawked
rolled
down
his
window
and
spat
an
extremely
large
yellowgreen
lunger
into
the
rainy
air
his
attitude
contradictory
but
somehow
attractive
almost
piquant
was
one
of
glum
good
cheer
guy
who
catches
that
won't
have
to
buy
no
fuckin
chewing
gum
for
a
week
pardon
my
french
if
you're
a
religious
man
tt
hasn't
all
changed
bill
said
the
depressing
promenade
of
banks
and
parking
lots
was
slipping
behind
them
as
they
climbed
center
street
over
the
hill
and
past
the
first
national
they
began
to
pick
up
some
speed
the
aladdin
still
there
yea
the
cabbie
conceded
but
just
barely
suckers
tried
to
tear
that
down
too
for
another
bank
bill
asked
a
pan
of
him
amused
to
find
that
another
part
of
him
stood
aghast
at
the
idea
he
couldn't
believe
that
anyone
in
his
right
mind
would
want
to
tear
down
that
stately
pleasure
dome
with
its
glittering
glass
chandelier
its
sweeping
rightandleft
staircases
which
spiraled
up
to
the
bakony
and
its
mammoth
curtain
which
did
not
simply
pull
apart
when
the
show
started
but
which
instead
rose
in
magical
folds
and
tucks
and
gathers
all
underlit
in
fabulous
shades
of
red
and
blue
and
yellow
and
green
while
pullies
off
stage
ratcheted
and
groaned
not
the
aladdin
that
shocked
part
of
him
cried
out
how
could
they
ever
even
think
of
tearing
down
the
aladdin
for
a
bank
oh
ayup
a
ban
the
cabbie
said
you're
fuckinga
pardon
my
french
if
you're
a
religious
man
it
was
the
first
merchants
of
penobscot
county
had
its
eye
on
the
laddin
wanted
to
pull
it
down
and
put
up
what
they
called
a
complete
banking
mall
got
all
the
papers
from
the
city
council
and
the
aladdin
was
condemned
then
a
bunch
of
folks
formed
a
committee
folks
that
had
lived
here
a
long
time
and
they
petitioned
and
they
marched
and
they
hollered
and
finally
they
had
a
public
city
council
meeting
about
it
and
hanlon
blew
those
suckers
out
the
cabbie
sounded
extremely
satisfied
hanlo
bill
asked
startled
mike
hanlon
ayu
the
cabbie
said
he
twisted
around
briefly
to
look
at
bill
revealing
a
round
chapped
face
and
hornrimmed
glasses
with
old
specks
of
white
paint
on
the
bows
librarian
black
fella
you
know
him
did
bill
said
remembering
how
he
had
met
mike
back
in
july
it
had
been
bowers
and
huggins
and
criss
again
of
course
bowers
and
huggins
and
criss
oh
my
at
every
turn
playing
their
own
part
unwitting
visegrips
driving
the
seven
of
them
together
tight
tighter
tightest
we
played
together
when
we
were
kids
before
i
moved
away
well
there
you
g
the
cabbie
said
it
a
small
fucking
world
pardon
my
french
if
you're
a
religious
man
bill
finished
with
him
there
you
g
the
cabbie
repeated
comfortably
and
they
rode
in
silence
for
awhile
before
he
said
it
changed
a
lot
derry
has
but
yeah
a
lot
of
it
still
here
the
town
house
where
i
picked
you
up
the
standpipe
in
memorial
park
you
emember
that
place
mister
when
we
were
kids
we
used
to
think
that
place
was
haunted
i
remember
it
bill
said
look
there
the
hospital
you
recognize
it
they
were
passing
the
derry
home
hospital
on
the
right
now
behind
it
the
penobscot
flowed
toward
its
meetingplace
with
the
kenduskeag
under
the
rainy
spring
sky
the
river
was
dull
pewter
the
hospital
that
bill
remembered
a
white
woodframe
building
with
two
wings
three
stories
high
was
still
there
but
now
it
was
surrounded
dwarfed
by
a
whole
complex
of
buildings
maybe
a
dozen
in
all
he
could
see
a
parkinglot
off
to
the
left
and
what
looked
like
better
than
five
hundred
cars
parked
there
my
god
that
not
a
hospital
that
a
fucking
college
campus
bill
exclaimed
the
cabdriver
cackled
not
bein
a
religious
man
i'll
pardon
your
french
yeah
it
almost
as
big
as
the
eastern
maine
up
in
bangor
now
they
got
radiation
labs
and
a
therapy
center
and
six
hundred
rooms
and
their
own
laundry
and
god
knows
what
else
the
old
hospital
still
there
but
it
all
administration
now
bill
felt
a
queer
doubling
sensation
in
his
mind
the
sort
of
sensation
he
remembered
getting
the
first
time
he
watched
a
d
movie
trying
to
bring
together
two
images
that
didn't
quite
jibe
you
could
fool
your
eyes
and
your
brain
into
doing
that
trick
he
remembered
but
you
were
apt
to
end
up
with
a
whopper
of
a
headache
and
he
could
feel
his
own
headache
coming
on
now
new
derry
fine
but
the
old
derry
was
still
here
like
the
wooden
home
hospital
building
the
old
derry
was
mostly
buried
under
all
the
new
construction
but
your
eye
was
somehow
dragged
helplessly
back
to
look
at
it
to
look
for
it
the
trainyard
probably
gone
isn't
it
bill
asked
the
cabbie
laughed
again
delighted
for
someone
who
moved
away
when
he
was
just
a
kid
you
got
a
good
memory
mister
bill
thought
you
should
have
met
me
last
week
my
frenchspeaking
friend
it
all
still
out
there
but
it
nothing
but
ruins
and
musty
tracks
now
the
freights
don't
even
stop
no
more
fella
wanted
to
buy
the
land
and
put
up
a
whole
roadside
entertainment
thing
_
pitch
n
putt
batting
cages
driving
ranges
mini
golf
gokarts
little
shack
fulla
video
games
i
don't
know
whatall
but
there
some
kind
of
big
mixup
about
who
owns
the
land
now
i
guess
he'll
get
it
eventually
he
a
persistent
fella
but
right
now
it
in
the
courts
and
the
canal
bill
murmured
as
they
turned
off
outer
center
street
and
onto
pasture
road
which
as
mike
had
said
was
now
marked
with
a
green
roadsign
reading
mall
road
the
canal
still
here
ayu
the
cabbie
said
that'll
always
be
here
i
guess
now
the
derry
mall
was
on
bill
left
and
as
they
rolled
past
it
he
felt
that
queer
doubling
sensation
again
when
they
had
been
kids
all
of
this
had
been
a
great
long
field
full
of
rank
grasses
and
gigantic
nodding
sunflowers
which
marked
the
northeastern
end
of
the
barrens
behind
it
to
the
west
was
the
old
cape
lowincome
housing
development
he
could
remember
them
exploring
this
field
being
careful
not
to
fall
into
the
gaping
cellarhold
of
the
kitchener
ironworks
which
had
exploded
on
easter
sunday
in
the
year
the
field
had
been
full
of
relics
and
they
had
unearthed
them
with
all
the
solemn
interest
of
archaeologists
exploring
egyptian
ruins
bricks
dippers
chunks
of
iron
with
rusty
bolts
hanging
from
them
panes
of
glass
bottles
full
of
unnamable
gunk
that
smelled
like
the
worst
poison
in
the
world
something
bad
had
happened
near
here
too
in
the
gravelpit
close
to
the
dump
but
he
could
not
remember
it
yet
he
could
only
remember
a
name
patrick
humboldt
and
that
it
had
something
to
do
with
a
refrigerator
and
something
about
a
bird
that
had
chased
mike
hanlon
what
he
shook
his
head
fragments
straws
in
the
wind
that
was
all
the
field
was
gone
now
as
were
the
remains
of
the
ironworks
bill
remembered
the
great
chimney
of
the
ironworks
suddenly
faced
with
tile
caked
black
with
soot
for
the
final
ten
feet
of
its
length
it
had
lain
in
the
high
grass
like
a
gigantic
pipe
they
had
scrambled
up
somehow
and
had
walked
along
it
arms
held
out
like
tightwire
walkers
laughing
he
shook
his
head
as
if
to
dismiss
the
mirage
of
the
mall
an
ugly
collection
of
buildings
with
signs
that
said
sears
and
j
c
penney
and
woolworth
s
and
cvs
and
york
steak
house
and
waldenbooks
and
dozens
of
others
roads
wove
in
and
out
of
parking
lots
the
mall
did
not
go
away
because
it
was
no
mirage
the
kitchener
ironworks
was
gone
and
the
field
that
had
grown
up
around
its
rums
was
likewise
gone
the
mall
was
the
reality
not
the
memories
but
somehow
he
didn't
believe
that
here
you
go
mister
the
cabbie
said
he
pulled
into
the
parkinglot
of
a
building
that
looked
like
a
large
plastic
pagoda
a
little
late
but
better
late
than
never
am
i
right
indeed
you
are
bill
said
he
gave
the
cab
driver
a
five
keep
the
change
good
fucking
deal
the
cabbie
exclaimed
you
need
someone
to
drive
you
call
big
yellow
and
ask
for
dave
ask
for
me
by
name
til
just
ask
for
the
religious
fella
bill
said
grinning
the
one
who
got
his
plot
all
picked
out
in
mount
hope
you
got
it
dave
said
laughing
have
a
good
one
mister
you
too
dave
he
stood
in
the
light
rain
for
a
moment
watching
the
cab
draw
away
he
realized
that
he
had
meant
to
ask
the
driver
one
more
question
and
had
forgotten
perhaps
on
purpose
he
had
meant
to
ask
dave
if
he
liked
living
in
derry
abruptly
bill
denbrough
turned
and
walked
into
the
jade
of
the
orient
mike
hanlon
was
in
the
lobby
sitting
in
a
wicker
chair
with
a
huge
flaring
back
he
got
to
his
feet
and
bill
felt
deep
unreality
wash
over
him
through
him
that
sensation
of
doubling
was
back
but
now
it
was
much
much
worse
he
remembered
a
boy
who
had
been
about
five
feet
three
trim
and
agile
before
him
was
a
man
who
stood
about
fiveseven
he
was
skinny
his
clothes
seemed
to
hang
on
him
and
the
lines
in
his
face
said
that
he
was
on
the
darker
side
of
forty
instead
of
only
thirtyeight
or
so
bill
shock
must
have
shown
on
his
face
because
mike
said
quietly
i
know
how
i
look
bill
flushed
and
said
it
not
that
bad
mike
it
just
that
i
remember
you
a
a
kid
that
all
it
is
ts
it
you
look
a
little
tired
i
am
a
little
tired
mike
said
but
i'll
make
it
i
guess
he
smiled
then
and
the
smile
lit
his
face
in
it
bill
saw
the
boy
he
had
known
twentyseven
years
ago
as
the
old
woodframe
home
hospital
had
been
overwhelmed
with
modern
glass
and
cinderblock
so
had
the
boy
that
bill
had
known
been
overwhelmed
with
the
inevitable
accessories
of
adulthood
there
were
wrinkles
on
his
forehead
lines
had
grooved
themselves
from
the
comers
of
his
mouth
nearly
to
his
chin
and
his
hair
was
graying
on
both
sides
above
the
ears
but
as
the
old
hospital
although
overwhelmed
was
still
there
still
visible
so
was
the
boy
bill
had
known
mike
stuck
out
his
hand
and
said
welcome
back
to
derry
big
bill
bill
ignored
the
hand
and
embraced
mike
mike
hugged
him
back
fiercely
and
bill
could
feel
his
hair
stiff
and
kinky
against
his
own
shoulder
and
the
side
of
his
neck
whatever
wrong
mike
we'll
take
care
of
it
bill
said
he
heard
the
rough
sound
of
tears
in
his
throat
and
didn't
care
we
beat
it
once
and
we
can
b
beat
it
aaagain
mike
pulled
away
from
him
held
him
at
arm
length
although
he
was
still
smiling
there
was
too
much
sparkle
in
his
eyes
he
took
out
ls
handkerchief
and
wiped
them
sure
bill
he
said
you
bet
would
you
gentlemen
like
to
follow
me
the
hostess
asked
she
was
a
smiling
oriental
woman
in
a
delicate
pink
kimono
upon
which
a
dragon
cavorted
and
curled
its
plated
tail
her
dark
hair
was
piled
high
on
her
head
and
held
with
ivory
combs
i
know
the
way
rose
mike
said
very
good
mr
hanlon
she
smiled
at
both
of
them
you
are
well
met
in
friendship
i
think
i
think
we
are
mike
said
this
way
bill
he
led
him
down
a
dim
corridor
past
the
main
dining
room
and
toward
a
door
where
a
beaded
curtain
hung
the
others
bill
began
all
here
now
mike
said
all
that
could
come
bill
hesitated
for
a
moment
outside
the
door
suddenly
frightened
it
was
not
the
unknown
that
scared
him
not
the
supernatural
it
was
the
simple
knowledge
that
he
was
fifteen
inches
taller
than
he
had
been
in
and
minus
most
of
his
hair
he
was
suddenly
uneasy
almost
terrified
at
the
thought
of
seeing
them
all
again
their
children
faces
almost
worn
away
almost
buried
under
change
as
the
old
hospital
had
been
buried
banks
erected
inside
their
heads
where
once
magic
picturepalaces
had
stood
we
grew
up
he
thought
we
didn't
think
it
would
happen
not
then
not
to
us
but
it
did
and
if
i
go
in
there
it
will
be
real
we're
all
grownups
now
he
looked
at
mike
suddenly
bewildered
and
timid
how
do
they
look
he
heard
himself
asking
in
a
faltering
voice
mike
how
do
they
look
come
in
and
find
out
mike
said
kindly
enough
and
led
bill
into
the
small
private
room
bill
denbrough
gets
a
look
perhaps
it
was
simply
the
dimness
of
the
room
that
caused
the
illusion
which
lasted
for
only
the
briefest
moment
but
bill
wondered
later
if
wasn't
some
sort
of
message
meant
strictly
for
him
that
fate
could
also
be
kind
in
that
brief
moment
it
seemed
to
him
that
none
of
them
had
grown
up
that
his
friends
had
somehow
done
a
peter
pan
act
and
were
all
still
children
richie
tozier
vas
rocked
back
in
his
chair
so
that
he
was
leaning
against
the
wall
caught
in
the
act
of
saying
something
to
beverly
marsh
who
had
a
hand
cupped
over
her
mouth
to
hide
a
giggle
richie
had
a
wiseass
grin
on
his
face
that
was
perfectly
familiar
there
was
eddie
kaspbrak
sitting
on
beverly
left
and
in
front
of
him
on
the
table
next
to
his
water
glass
was
a
plastic
squeezebottle
with
a
pistol
grip
handle
curving
down
from
its
top
the
trimmings
were
a
little
more
stateoftheart
but
the
purpose
was
obviously
the
same
it
was
an
aspirator
sitting
at
one
end
of
the
table
watching
this
trio
with
an
expression
of
mixed
anxiety
amusement
and
concentration
was
ben
hanscom
bill
found
his
hand
wanting
to
go
to
his
head
and
realized
with
a
sorry
kind
of
amusement
that
in
that
second
he
had
almost
rubbed
his
pate
to
see
if
his
haur
had
magically
come
back
that
red
fine
hair
that
he
had
begun
to
lose
when
he
was
only
a
college
sophomore
that
broke
the
bubble
richie
was
not
wearing
glasses
he
saw
and
thought
he
probably
has
contacts
now
he
would
he
hated
those
glasses
the
teeshirts
and
cord
pants
he'd
habitually
worn
had
been
replaced
by
a
suit
that
hadn't
been
purchased
off
any
rack
bill
estimated
that
he
was
looking
at
nine
hundred
dollar
worth
of
tailormade
on
the
hoof
beverly
marsh
if
her
name
still
was
marsh
had
become
a
stunningly
beautiful
woman
instead
of
the
casual
ponytail
her
hair
which
was
almost
exactly
the
same
shade
his
own
had
been
spilled
over
the
shoulders
of
her
plain
white
ship
n
shore
blouse
in
a
torrent
of
subdued
color
in
this
dim
light
it
merely
glowed
like
a
wellbanked
bed
of
embers
in
daylight
even
the
light
of
such
a
subdued
day
as
this
one
bill
imagined
it
would
flame
and
he
found
himself
wondering
what
it
would
feel
like
to
plunge
his
hands
into
that
hair
the
world
oldest
story
he
thought
wryly
i
love
my
wife
but
oh
you
kid
eddie
it
was
weird
but
true
had
grown
up
to
look
quite
a
little
bit
like
anthony
perkins
his
face
was
prematurely
lined
although
in
his
movements
he
seemed
somehow
younger
than
either
richie
or
ben
and
made
older
still
by
the
rimless
spectacles
he
wore
spectacles
you
would
imagine
a
british
barrister
wearing
as
he
approached
the
bench
or
leafed
through
a
legal
brief
his
hair
was
short
worn
in
an
outofdate
style
that
had
been
known
as
ivy
league
in
the
late
fifties
and
early
sixties
he
was
wearing
a
loud
checked
sportcoat
that
looked
like
something
grabbed
from
the
distress
sale
rack
of
a
men
clothing
store
that
would
shortly
be
out
of
business
but
the
watch
on
one
wrist
was
a
patek
philippe
and
the
ring
on
the
little
finger
of
his
right
hand
was
a
ruby
the
stone
was
too
hugely
vulgar
and
too
ostentatious
to
be
anything
but
real
ben
was
the
one
who
had
really
changed
and
looking
at
him
again
bill
felt
unreality
wash
easily
over
him
his
face
was
the
same
and
his
hair
although
graying
and
longer
was
combed
in
the
same
unusual
rightside
part
but
ben
had
gotten
thin
he
sat
easily
enough
in
his
chair
his
unadorned
leather
vest
open
to
show
the
blue
chambray
workshirt
beneath
he
wore
levi
with
straight
legs
cowboy
boots
and
a
wide
belt
with
a
beatensilver
buckle
these
clothes
clung
easily
to
a
body
which
was
slim
and
natrowhipped
he
wore
a
bracelet
with
heavy
links
on
one
wrist
not
gold
links
but
copper
ones
he
got
thin
bill
thought
he
a
shadow
of
his
former
self
so
to
speak
ole
ben
got
thin
wonders
never
cease
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
among
the
six
of
them
that
was
beyond
description
it
was
one
of
the
strangest
moments
bill
denbrough
ever
passed
in
his
life
stan
was
not
here
but
a
seventh
had
come
nonetheless
here
in
this
private
restaurant
dining
room
bill
felt
its
presence
so
fully
that
it
was
almost
personified
but
not
as
an
old
man
in
a
white
robe
with
a
scythe
on
his
shoulder
it
was
the
white
spot
on
the
map
which
lay
between
and
an
area
an
explorer
might
have
called
the
great
don't
know
bill
wondered
what
exactly
was
there
beverly
marsh
in
a
short
skirt
which
showed
most
of
her
long
coltish
legs
a
beverly
marsh
in
white
gogo
boots
her
hair
parted
in
the
middle
and
ironed
richie
tozier
carrying
a
sign
which
said
stop
the
war
on
one
side
and
get
rotc
off
campus
on
the
other
ben
hanscom
in
a
yellow
hardhat
with
a
flag
decal
on
the
front
running
a
bulldozer
under
a
canvas
parasol
his
shirt
off
showing
a
stomach
which
protruded
less
and
less
over
the
waistband
of
his
pants
was
this
seventh
creature
black
no
relation
to
either
rap
brown
or
grandmaster
flash
not
this
fellow
this
fellow
wore
plain
white
shirts
and
fadeintothe
woodwork
j
c
penney
slacks
and
he
sat
in
a
library
carrell
at
the
university
of
maine
writing
papers
on
the
origin
of
footnotes
and
the
possible
advantages
of
isbn
numbers
in
book
cataloguing
while
the
marchers
marched
outside
and
phil
ochs
sang
richard
nixon
find
yourself
another
country
to
be
part
of
and
men
died
with
their
stomachs
blown
out
for
villages
whose
names
they
could
not
pronounce
he
sat
there
studiously
bent
over
his
work
bill
saw
him
which
lay
in
a
slant
of
crisp
white
winterlight
his
face
sober
and
absorbed
knowing
that
to
be
a
librarian
was
to
come
as
close
as
any
human
being
can
to
sitting
in
the
peakseat
of
eternity
engine
was
he
the
seventh
or
was
it
a
young
man
standing
before
his
mirror
looking
at
the
way
his
forehead
was
growing
looking
at
a
combful
of
pulledout
red
hairs
looking
at
a
pile
of
university
notebooks
on
the
desk
reflected
in
the
mirror
notebooks
which
held
the
completed
messy
first
draft
of
a
novel
entitled
joanna
which
would
be
published
a
year
later
some
of
the
above
all
of
the
above
none
of
the
above
it
didn't
matter
really
the
seventh
was
there
and
in
that
one
moment
hey
all
felt
it
and
perhaps
understood
best
the
dreadful
power
of
the
thing
that
had
brought
them
back
it
lives
bill
thought
cold
inside
his
clothes
eye
of
newt
tail
of
dragon
hand
of
glory
whatever
it
was
it
here
again
in
derry
it
and
he
felt
suddenly
that
jt
was
the
seventh
that
it
and
time
were
somehow
interchangeable
that
it
wore
all
their
faces
as
well
as
the
thousand
others
with
which
it
had
terrified
and
killed
and
the
idea
that
/t
might
be
them
was
somehow
the
nost
frightening
idea
of
all
how
much
of
us
was
left
behind
here
he
thought
with
sudden
rising
terror
how
much
of
us
never
left
the
drains
and
the
sewers
where
it
lived
and
where
it
fed
is
that
why
we
forgot
because
part
of
each
of
us
never
had
any
future
never
grew
never
left
derry
is
that
why
he
saw
no
answers
on
their
faces
only
his
own
questions
reflected
back
at
him
thoughts
form
and
pass
in
a
matter
of
seconds
or
milliseconds
and
create
their
own
time
frames
and
all
of
his
passed
through
bill
denbrough
mind
in
a
space
of
no
more
than
five
seconds
then
richie
tozier
leaning
back
against
the
wall
grinned
again
and
said
oh
my
look
at
this
bill
denbrough
went
for
the
chrome
dome
look
how
long
you
been
turtle
waxing
your
head
big
bill
and
bill
with
no
idea
at
all
of
what
might
come
out
opened
his
mouth
and
heard
himself
say
fuck
you
and
the
horse
you
rode
in
on
trashmouth
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
and
then
the
room
exploded
with
laughter
bill
crossed
to
them
and
began
to
shake
hands
and
while
there
was
something
horrible
in
what
he
now
felt
there
was
also
something
comforting
about
it
this
sensation
of
having
come
home
for
good
ben
hanscom
gets
skinny
mike
hanlon
ordered
drinks
and
as
if
to
make
up
for
the
prior
silence
everyone
began
to
talk
at
once
beverly
marsh
was
now
beverly
rogan
it
turned
out
she
said
she
was
married
to
a
wonderful
man
in
chicago
who
had
turned
her
whole
life
around
and
who
had
by
some
benign
magic
been
able
to
transform
his
wife
simple
talent
for
sewing
into
a
successful
dress
business
eddie
kaspbrak
owned
a
limousine
company
in
new
york
for
all
i
know
my
wife
could
be
in
bed
with
al
pacino
right
now
he
said
smiling
mildly
and
the
room
broke
up
they
all
knew
what
bill
and
ben
had
been
up
to
but
bill
had
a
peculiar
sense
that
there
had
been
no
personal
association
of
their
names
ben
as
an
architect
himself
as
a
writer
with
people
they
had
known
as
children
until
very
very
recently
beverly
had
paperback
copies
of
joanna
and
the
black
rapids
in
her
purse
and
asked
him
if
he
would
sign
them
bill
did
so
noticing
as
he
did
that
both
books
were
in
mint
condition
as
if
they
had
been
purchased
in
the
airport
newsstand
as
she
got
off
the
plane
in
like
fashion
richie
told
ben
how
much
he
had
admired
the
bbc
communications
center
in
london
but
there
was
a
puzzled
son
of
light
in
his
eyes
as
if
he
could
not
quite
reconcile
that
building
with
this
man
or
with
the
fat
eamest
boy
who
had
showed
them
how
to
flood
out
half
the
barrens
with
scrounged
boards
and
a
rusty
car
door
richie
was
a
disc
jockey
in
california
he
told
them
he
was
known
as
the
man
of
a
thousand
voices
and
bill
groaned
god
richie
your
voices
were
always
so
terrible
flattery
will
get
you
nowhere
mawste
richie
replied
loftily
when
beverly
asked
him
if
he
wore
contacts
now
richie
said
in
a
low
voice
come
a
little
closer
baybee
look
in
my
eyes
beverly
did
and
exclaimed
delightedly
as
richie
tilted
his
head
a
little
so
she
could
see
the
lower
rims
of
the
hydromist
soft
lenses
he
wore
is
the
library
still
the
same
ben
asked
mike
hanlon
mike
took
out
his
wallet
and
produced
a
snap
of
the
library
taken
from
above
he
did
it
with
the
proud
air
of
a
man
producing
snapshots
of
his
kids
when
asked
about
his
family
guy
in
a
light
plane
took
this
he
said
as
the
picture
went
from
hand
to
hand
tve
been
trying
to
get
either
the
city
council
or
some
wellheeled
private
donor
to
supply
enough
cash
to
get
it
blown
up
to
mural
size
for
the
children
library
so
far
no
soap
but
it
a
good
picture
huh
they
all
agreed
that
it
was
ben
held
it
longest
looking
at
it
fixedly
finally
he
tapped
the
glass
corridor
which
wnnected
the
two
buildings
do
you
recognize
this
from
anywhere
else
mike
mike
smiled
it
your
communications
center
he
said
and
all
six
of
them
burst
out
laughing
the
drinks
came
they
sat
down
that
silence
sudden
awkward
and
perplexing
fell
again
they
looked
at
each
other
well
beverly
asked
in
her
sweet
slightly
husky
voice
what
do
we
drink
to
to
us
richie
said
suddenly
and
now
he
wasn't
smiling
his
eyes
caught
bill
and
with
a
force
so
great
he
could
barely
deal
with
it
bill
remembered
himself
and
richie
in
the
middle
of
neibolt
street
after
the
thing
which
might
have
been
a
clown
or
which
might
have
been
a
werewolf
had
disappeared
embracing
each
other
and
weeping
when
he
picked
up
his
glass
his
hand
was
trembling
and
some
of
his
drink
spilled
on
the
napery
richie
rose
slowly
to
his
feet
and
one
by
one
the
others
followed
suit
bill
first
then
ben
and
eddie
beverly
and
finally
mike
hanlon
to
us
richie
said
and
like
bill
hand
his
voice
trembled
a
little
to
the
loser
club
of
the
losers
beverly
said
slightly
amused
the
losers
eddie
said
his
face
was
pale
and
old
behind
his
rimless
glasses
the
losers
ben
agreed
a
faint
and
painful
smile
ghosted
at
the
corners
of
his
mouth
the
loser
mike
hanlon
said
softly
the
losers
bill
finished
their
glasses
touched
they
drank
that
silence
fell
again
and
this
time
richie
did
not
break
it
this
time
the
silence
seemed
necessary
they
sat
back
down
and
bill
said
so
spill
it
mike
tell
us
what
been
happening
here
and
what
we
can
do
eat
firs
mike
said
we'll
talk
afterward
so
they
ate
and
they
ate
long
and
well
like
that
old
joke
about
the
condemned
man
bill
thought
but
his
own
appetite
was
better
than
it
had
been
in
ages
since
he
was
a
kid
he
was
tempted
to
think
the
food
was
not
stunningly
good
but
it
was
far
from
bad
and
there
was
a
lot
of
it
the
six
of
them
began
trading
stuff
back
and
forth
spareribs
moo
goo
gaipan
chicken
wings
that
had
been
delicately
braised
egg
rolls
water
chestnuts
wrapped
in
bacon
strips
of
beef
that
had
been
threaded
onto
wooden
skewers
they
began
with
pupu
platters
and
richie
made
a
childish
but
amusing
business
of
broiling
a
little
bit
of
everything
over
the
flaming
pot
in
the
center
of
the
platter
he
was
sharing
with
beverly
including
half
an
egg
roll
and
a
few
red
kidney
beans
flambé
at
my
table
i
love
it
he
told
ben
td
eat
shit
on
a
shingle
if
it
was
flambé
at
my
table
and
probably
has
bill
remarked
beverly
laughed
so
hard
at
this
she
had
to
spit
a
mouthful
of
food
into
her
napkin
oh
god
i
think
i'm
gonna
ralph
richie
said
in
an
eerily
exact
imitation
of
don
pardo
and
beverly
laughed
harder
blushing
a
bright
red
stop
it
richi
she
said
tm
warning
you
the
warning
is
taken
richie
said
eat
well
dear
rose
herself
brought
them
their
dessert
a
great
mound
of
baked
alaska
&ltvhich
she
ignited
at
the
head
of
the
table
where
mike
sat
more
flambé
at
my
table
richie
said
in
the
voice
of
a
man
who
has
died
and
gone
to
heaven
this
may
be
the
best
meal
i've
ever
eaten
in
my
life
but
of
course
rose
said
demurely
if
i
blow
that
out
do
i
get
my
wish
he
asked
her
at
jade
of
the
orient
all
wishes
are
granted
sir
richie
smile
faltered
suddenly
i
applaud
the
sentiment
he
said
but
you
know
i
really
doubt
the
veracity
they
almost
demolished
the
baked
alaska
as
bill
sat
back
his
belly
straining
the
waistband
of
his
pants
he
happened
to
notice
the
glasses
on
the
table
there
seemed
to
be
hundreds
of
them
he
grinned
a
little
realizing
that
he
himself
had
sunk
two
martinis
before
the
meal
and
god
knew
how
many
bottles
of
kirin
beer
with
it
the
others
had
done
about
as
well
in
their
state
fried
chunks
of
bowling
pin
would
probably
have
tasted
okay
and
yet
he
didn't
feel
drunk
haven't
eaten
like
that
since
i
was
a
kid
ben
said
they
looked
at
him
and
a
faint
flush
of
color
tinged
his
cheeks
i
mean
it
literally
that
may
be
the
biggest
meal
i've
eaten
since
i
was
a
sophomore
in
high
school
you
went
on
a
die
eddie
asked
yea
ben
said
i
did
the
ben
hanscom
freedom
diet
what
got
you
going
richie
asked
you
don't
want
to
hear
all
that
ancient
history
ben
shifted
uncomfortably
don't
know
about
the
rest
of
the
bill
said
but
i
do
come
on
ben
give
what
turned
haystack
calhoun
into
the
magazine
model
we
see
before
us
today
richie
snorted
a
little
haystack
right
i'd
forgotten
that
it
not
much
of
a
story
ben
said
no
story
at
all
really
after
that
summer
after
we
stayed
in
derry
another
two
years
then
my
mom
lost
her
job
and
we
ended
up
moving
to
nebraska
because
she
had
a
sister
there
who
offered
to
take
us
in
until
my
mother
got
on
her
feet
again
it
wasn't
so
great
her
sister
my
aunt
jean
was
a
miserly
bitch
who
had
to
keep
telling
you
what
your
place
in
the
great
scheme
of
things
was
how
lucky
we
were
that
my
mom
had
a
sister
who
could
give
us
charity
how
lucky
we
were
not
to
be
on
welfare
all
that
sort
of
thing
i
was
so
fat
i
disgusted
her
she
couldn't
leave
it
alone
ben
you
ought
to
get
more
exercise
ben
you'll
have
a
heart
attack
before
you're
forty
if
you
don't
lose
weight
ben
with
little
children
starving
in
the
world
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
he
paused
for
a
moment
and
sipped
some
water
the
thing
was
she
also
trotted
the
starving
children
out
if
i
didn't
clean
my
plate
richie
laughed
and
nodded
anyway
the
country
was
just
pulling
out
of
a
recession
and
my
mother
was
almost
a
year
finding
steady
work
by
the
time
we
moved
out
of
aunt
jean
place
in
la
vista
and
got
our
own
in
omaha
i'd
put
on
about
ninety
pounds
over
when
you
guys
knew
me
i
think
i
put
on
most
of
it
just
to
spite
my
aunt
jean
eddie
whistled
that
would
have
put
you
at
about
at
about
two
hundred
and
ten
ben
said
gravely
anyway
i
was
going
to
east
side
high
school
in
omaha
and
the
physedperiods
were
well
pretty
bad
the
other
kids
called
me
jugs
that
ought
to
give
you
the
idea
the
ragging
went
on
for
about
seven
months
and
then
one
day
while
we
were
getting
dressed
n
the
locker
room
after
the
period
two
or
three
of
the
guys
started
to
to
kind
of
slap
my
gut
they
called
it
fatpaddling
pretty
soon
two
or
three
others
got
in
on
it
then
four
or
five
more
pretty
soon
it
was
all
of
them
chasing
me
around
the
locker
room
and
up
the
hall
whacking
my
gut
my
butt
my
back
my
legs
i
got
scared
and
started
to
scream
that
made
the
rest
of
them
laugh
like
crazy
you
know
he
said
looking
down
and
carefully
rearranging
his
silverware
that
the
last
time
i
can
remember
thinking
of
henry
bowers
until
mike
called
me
two
days
ago
the
kid
who
started
it
was
a
farmboy
with
these
big
old
hands
and
while
they
were
chasing
after
me
i
remember
thinking
that
henry
had
come
back
i
think
no
i
know
that
when
i
panicked
they
chased
me
up
the
hall
past
the
lockers
where
the
guys
who
played
sports
kept
their
stuff
i
was
naked
and
red
as
a
lobster
i'd
lost
any
sense
of
dignity
or
or
of
myself
i
guess
you'd
say
where
myself
was
i
was
screaming
for
help
and
here
they
came
after
me
screaming
fatpaddling
fatpaddling
fatpaddling
there
was
a
bench
ben
you
don't
have
to
put
yourself
through
this
beverly
said
suddenly
her
face
had
gone
ashypale
she
toyed
with
her
waterglass
and
almost
spilled
it
let
him
finish
bill
said
ben
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
and
then
nodded
there
was
a
bench
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
i
fell
over
it
and
hit
my
head
they
were
all
around
me
in
another
minute
or
two
and
then
this
voice
said
okay
that
enough
you
guys
go
change
up
tt
was
coach
standing
there
in
the
doorway
wearing
his
blue
sweatpants
with
the
white
stripe
up
the
sides
and
his
white
teeshirt
there
was
no
way
of
telling
how
long
he'd
been
standing
there
they
all
looked
at
him
some
of
them
grinning
some
of
them
guilty
some
of
them
just
looking
sort
of
vacant
they
went
away
and
i
burst
into
tears
coach
just
stood
there
in
the
doorway
leading
back
to
the
gym
watching
me
watching
this
naked
fat
boy
with
his
skin
all
red
from
the
fatpaddling
watching
this
fat
kid
crying
on
the
floor
and
finally
he
said
benny
why
don't
you
just
fucking
shut
up
tt
shocked
me
so
much
to
hear
a
teacher
use
that
word
that
i
did
i
looked
up
at
him
and
he
came
over
and
sat
down
on
the
bench
i'd
fallen
over
he
leaned
over
me
and
the
whistle
around
his
neck
swung
out
and
bonked
me
on
the
forehead
for
a
second
i
thought
he
was
going
to
kiss
me
or
something
and
i
shrank
back
from
him
but
what
he
did
was
grab
one
of
my
tits
in
each
hand
and
squeeze
then
he
took
his
hands
away
and
rubbed
them
on
his
pants
like
he'd
touched
something
dirty
you
think
i'm
going
to
comfort
you
he
asked
me
i'm
not
you
disgust
them
and
you
disgust
me
as
well
we
got
different
reasons
but
that
because
they're
kids
and
i'm
not
they
don't
know
why
you
disgust
them
i
do
know
it
because
i
see
you
burying
the
good
body
god
gave
you
in
a
great
big
mess
of
fat
it
a
lot
of
stupid
selfindulgence
and
it
makes
me
want
to
puke
now
listen
to
me
benny
because
this
is
the
only
tune
i'm
going
to
say
it
to
you
i
got
a
football
team
to
coach
and
basketball
and
track
and
some
where
in
between
i've
got
swimming
team
so
i'll
just
say
it
once
you're
fat
up
here
and
he
tapped
my
forehead
right
where
his
damned
whistle
had
bonked
me
that
where
everybody
fat
you
put
what
between
your
ears
on
a
diet
and
you're
going
to
lose
weight
but
guys
like
you
never
do
what
a
bastard
beverly
said
indignantly
yea
ben
said
grinning
but
he
didn't
know
he
was
a
bastard
that
how
dumb
he
was
he'd
probably
seen
jack
webb
in
that
movie
the
d.i
about
sixty
times
and
he
actually
thought
he
was
doing
me
a
favor
and
as
it
turned
out
he
was
because
i
thought
of
something
right
then
i
thought
he
looked
away
frowning
and
bill
had
the
strangest
feeling
that
he
knew
what
ben
was
going
to
say
before
he
said
it
i
told
you
that
the
last
time
i
can
remember
thinking
of
henry
bowers
was
when
the
other
boys
were
chasing
after
me
and
fatpaddling
well
when
the
coach
was
getting
up
to
go
that
was
the
last
time
i
really
thought
of
what
we'd
done
in
the
summer
of
i
thought
he
hesitated
again
looking
at
each
of
them
in
turn
seeming
to
search
their
faces
he
went
on
carefully
i
thought
of
how
good
we
were
together
i
thought
of
what
we
did
and
how
we
did
it
and
all
at
once
it
hit
me
that
if
coach
had
to
face
anything
like
that
his
hair
would
probably
have
turned
white
all
at
once
and
his
heart
would
have
stopped
dead
in
his
chest
like
an
old
watch
it
wasn't
fair
of
course
but
he
hadn't
been
fair
to
me
what
happened
was
simple
enough
you
got
mad
bill
said
ben
smiled
yeah
that
right
he
said
i
called
coach
he
turned
around
and
looked
at
me
you
say
you
coach
track
i
asked
him
that
right
he
said
not
that
it
anything
to
you
you
listen
to
me
you
stupid
stonebrained
son
of
a
bitch
i
said
and
his
mouth
dropped
open
and
his
eyes
bugged
out
i'll
be
out
there
for
the
track
team
in
march
what
do
you
think
about
that
i
think
you
better
shut
your
mouth
before
it
gets
you
into
big
trouble
he
said
im
going
to
run
down
everyone
you
get
out
i
said
i'm
going
to
run
down
your
best
and
then
i
want
a
fucking
apology
from
you
his
fists
clenched
and
for
a
minute
i
thought
he
was
going
to
come
back
in
there
and
let
me
have
it
then
they
unclenched
again
you
just
keep
talking
fatboy”
he
said
softly
you
got
the
motormouth
but
the
day
you
can
outrun
my
best
will
be
the
day
i
quit
this
place
and
go
back
to
picking
corn
on
the
circuit
and
he
left
you
lost
the
weight
richie
asked
well
i
did
ben
said
but
coach
was
wrong
it
didn't
start
in
my
head
it
started
with
my
mother
i
went
home
that
night
and
told
her
i
wanted
to
lose
some
weight
we
ended
up
having
a
hell
of
a
fight
both
of
us
crying
she
started
out
with
that
same
old
song
and
dance
i
wasn't
really
fat
i
just
had
big
bones
and
a
big
boy
who
was
going
to
be
a
big
man
had
to
eat
big
just
to
stay
even
it
was
a
a
kind
of
security
thing
with
her
i
think
it
was
scary
for
her
trying
to
raise
a
boy
on
her
own
she
had
no
education
and
no
real
skills
just
a
willingness
to
work
hard
and
when
she
could
give
me
a
second
helping
or
when
she
could
look
across
the
table
at
me
and
see
that
i
was
looking
solid
she
felt
like
she
was
winning
the
battle
mike
said
uhhuh
ben
drank
off
the
last
of
his
beer
and
wiped
a
small
mustache
of
foam
off
his
upper
lip
with
the
heel
of
his
hand
so
the
biggest
fight
wasn't
with
my
head
it
was
with
her
she
just
wouldn't
accept
it
not
for
months
she
wouldn't
take
in
my
clothes
and
she
wouldn't
buy
me
new
ones
i
was
running
by
then
i
ran
everywhere
and
sometimes
my
heart
pounded
so
hard
i
felt
like
i
was
going
to
pass
out
the
first
of
my
mile
runs
i
finished
by
puking
and
then
fainting
then
for
awhile
i
just
puked
and
after
awhile
i
was
holding
up
my
pants
while
iran
i
got
a
paperroute
and
i
ran
with
the
bag
around
my
neck
bouncing
against
my
chest
while
i
held
up
my
pants
my
shirts
started
to
look
like
sails
and
nights
when
i
went
home
and
would
only
eat
half
the
stuff
on
my
plate
my
mother
would
burst
nto
tears
and
say
that
i
was
starving
myself
killing
myself
that
i
didn't
love
her
anymore
that
i
didn't
care
about
how
hard
she
had
worked
for
me
christ
richie
muttered
lighting
a
cigarette
i
don't
know
how
you
handled
it
ben
i
just
kept
the
coach
face
in
front
of
me
ben
said
i
just
kept
remembering
the
way
he
looked
after
he
grabbed
my
tits
in
the
hallway
to
the
boy
locker
room
that
time
that
how
i
did
it
i
got
myself
some
new
jeans
and
stuff
with
the
paperroute
money
and
the
old
guy
in
the
firstfloor
apartment
used
his
awl
to
punch
some
new
holes
in
my
belt
about
five
of
them
as
i
remember
i
think
that
i
might
have
remembered
the
other
time
i
had
to
buy
a
pair
of
new
jeans
that
was
when
henry
pushed
me
into
the
barrens
that
day
and
they
just
about
got
torn
off
my
body
yea
eddie
said
grinning
and
you
told
me
about
the
chocolate
milk
remember
that
ben
nodded
if
i
did
remember
he
went
on
it
was
just
for
a
second
there
and
gone
about
that
same
time
i
started
taking
health
and
nutrition
at
school
and
i
found
out
you
could
eat
just
about
all
the
raw
green
stuff
you
wanted
and
not
gain
weight
so
one
night
my
mother
put
on
a
salad
with
lettuce
and
raw
spinach
in
it
chunks
of
apple
and
maybe
a
little
leftover
ham
now
i've
never
liked
rabbitfood
that
much
but
i
had
three
helpings
and
just
raved
on
and
on
to
my
mother
about
how
good
it
was
that
went
a
long
way
toward
solving
the
problem
she
didn't
care
so
much
what
i
ate
as
long
as
i
ate
a
lot
of
it
she
buried
me
in
salads
i
ate
them
for
the
next
three
years
there
were
times
when
i
had
to
look
in
the
mirror
to
make
sure
my
nose
wasn't
wriggling
so
what
happened
about
the
coach
eddie
asked
did
you
go
out
for
track
he
touched
his
aspirator
as
if
the
thought
of
running
had
reminded
him
of
it
oh
yeah
i
went
out
ben
said
the
twotwenty
and
the
fourforty
by
then
i'd
lost
seventy
pounds
and
i'd
sprung
up
two
inches
so
that
what
was
left
was
better
distributed
on
the
first
day
of
trials
i
won
the
twotwenty
by
six
lengths
and
the
fourforty
by
eight
then
i
went
over
to
coach
who
looked
mad
enough
to
chew
nails
and
spit
out
staples
and
i
said
looks
like
it
time
you
got
out
on
the
circuit
and
started
picking
mm
when
are
you
heading
down
kansas
way
he
didn't
say
a
thing
at
first
just
swung
a
roundhouse
and
knocked
me
flat
on
my
back
then
he
told
me
to
get
off
the
field
said
he
didn't
want
a
smartmouth
bastard
like
me
on
his
track
team
i
wouldn't
be
on
it
if
president
kennedy
appointed
me
to
it
i
said
wiping
blood
out
of
the
comer
of
my
mouth
and
since
you
got
me
going
i
won't
hold
you
to
it
but
the
next
time
you
sit
down
to
a
big
plate
of
corn
on
the
cob
spare
me
a
thought
he
told
me
if
i
didn't
get
out
right
then
he
was
going
to
beat
the
living
crap
out
of
me
ben
was
smiling
a
little
but
there
was
nothing
very
pleasant
about
that
smile
certainly
nothing
nostalgic
those
were
his
exact
words
everyone
was
watching
us
including
the
kids
i'd
beaten
they
looked
pretty
embarrassed
so
i
just
said
til
tell
you
what
coach
you
get
one
free
on
account
of
you're
a
sore
loser
but
too
old
to
learn
any
better
now
but
you
put
one
more
on
me
and
i'll
try
to
see
to
it
hat
you
lose
your
job
i'm
not
sure
i
can
do
it
but
i
can
make
a
good
try
i
lost
the
weight
so
i
could
have
a
little
dignity
and
a
little
peace
those
are
things
worth
fighting
for
bill
said
all
of
that
sounds
wonderful
ben
but
the
writer
in
me
wonders
if
any
kid
ever
really
talked
like
that
ben
nodded
still
smiling
that
peculiar
smile
i
doubt
if
any
kid
who
hadn't
been
through
the
things
we
went
through
ever
did
he
said
but
i
said
them
and
i
meant
them
bill
thought
about
this
and
then
nodded
all
right
the
coach
stood
back
with
his
hands
on
the
hips
of
his
sweatpants
ben
said
he
opened
his
mouth
and
then
he
closed
it
again
nobody
said
anything
i
walked
off
and
that
was
the
last
i
had
to
do
with
coach
woodleigh
when
my
homeroom
teacher
handed
me
my
course
sheet
for
my
junior
year
someone
had
typed
the
word
excused
next
to
phys
ed
and
he'd
initialed
it
you
beat
hi
richie
exclaimed
and
shook
his
clenched
hands
over
his
head
way
to
go
be
ben
shrugged
i
think
what
i
did
was
beat
part
of
myself
coach
got
me
going
i
guess
but
it
was
thinking
of
you
guys
that
made
me
really
believe
that
i
could
do
it
and
i
did
do
it
ben
shrugged
charmingly
but
bill
believed
he
could
see
fine
drops
of
sweat
at
his
hairline
end
of
true
confessions
except
i
sure
could
use
another
beer
talking
thirsty
work
mike
signalled
the
waitress
all
six
of
them
ended
up
ordering
another
round
and
they
talked
of
light
matters
until
the
drinks
came
bill
looked
into
his
beer
watching
the
way
the
bubbles
crawled
up
the
sides
of
the
glass
he
was
both
amused
and
appalled
to
realize
he
was
hoping
someone
else
would
begin
to
story
about
the
years
between
that
beverly
would
tell
them
about
the
wonderful
man
she
had
married
even
if
he
was
boring
as
most
wonderful
men
were
or
that
richie
tozier
would
begin
to
expound
on
funny
incidents
in
the
broadcasting
studio
or
that
eddie
kaspbrak
would
tell
them
what
teddy
kennedy
was
really
like
how
much
robert
redford
tipped
or
maybe
offer
some
insights
into
why
ben
had
been
able
to
give
up
the
extra
pounds
while
he
had
needed
to
hang
onto
his
aspirator
the
fact
is
bill
thought
mike
is
going
to
start
talking
any
minute
now
and
im
not
sure
i
want
to
hear
what
he
has
to
say
the
fact
is
my
heart
is
beating
just
a
little
too
fast
and
my
hands
are
just
a
little
too
cold
the
fact
is
i'm
just
about
twentyfive
years
too
old
to
be
this
scared
we
all
are
so
say
something
someone
let
talk
of
careers
and
spouses
and
what
it
like
to
look
at
your
old
playmates
and
realize
that
you've
taken
a
few
really
good
shots
in
the
nose
from
time
itself
let
talk
about
sex
baseball
the
price
of
gas
the
future
of
the
warsaw
pact
nations
anything
but
what
we
came
here
to
talk
about
so
say
something
some
body
someone
did
eddie
kaspbrak
did
but
it
was
not
what
teddy
kennedy
was
really
like
or
how
much
redford
tipped
or
even
why
he
had
found
it
necessary
to
keep
what
richie
had
sometimes
called
eddie
lungsucker
in
the
old
days
he
asked
mike
when
stan
uris
had
died
the
night
before
last
when
i
made
the
calls
did
it
have
to
do
with
with
why
we're
here
could
beg
the
question
and
say
that
since
he
didn't
leave
a
note
no
one
can
know
for
sure
mike
answered
but
since
it
happened
almost
immediately
after
i
called
him
i
think
the
assumption
is
safe
enough
he
killed
himself
didn't
he
beverly
said
dully
oh
god
poor
stan
the
others
were
looking
at
mike
who
finished
his
drink
and
said
he
committed
suicide
yes
apparently
went
up
to
the
bathroom
shortly
after
i
called
him
drew
a
bath
got
into
it
and
cut
his
wrists
bill
looked
down
the
table
which
seemed
suddenly
lined
with
hhocked
pale
faces
no
bodies
only
those
faces
like
white
circles
like
white
balloons
moon
balloons
tethered
here
by
an
old
promise
that
should
have
long
since
lapsed
how
did
you
find
out
richie
asked
was
it
carried
in
the
papers
up
here
no
for
some
time
now
i've
subscribed
to
the
newspapers
of
those
towns
closest
to
all
of
you
i
have
kept
tabs
over
the
years
i
spy
richie
face
was
sour
thanks
mike
tt
was
my
job
mike
said
simply
poor
stan
beverly
repeated
she
seemed
stunned
unable
to
cope
with
the
news
but
he
was
so
brave
back
then
so
determined
people
change
eddie
said
'do
they
bill
asked
stan
was
he
moved
his
hands
on
the
tablecloth
trying
to
catch
the
right
words
he
was
an
ordered
person
the
kind
of
person
who
has
to
have
his
books
divided
up
into
fiction
and
nonfiction
on
his
shelves
and
then
wants
to
have
each
section
in
alphabetical
order
i
can
remember
something
he
said
once
i
don't
remember
where
we
were
or
what
we
were
doing
at
least
not
yet
but
i
think
it
was
toward
the
end
of
things
he
said
he
could
stand
to
be
scared
but
he
hated
being
dirty
that
seemed
to
me
the
essence
of
stan
maybe
it
was
just
too
much
when
mike
called
he
saw
his
choices
as
being
only
two
stay
alive
and
get
dirty
or
die
clean
maybe
people
really
don't
change
as
much
as
we
think
maybe
they
just
maybe
they
just
stiffenup
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
and
then
richie
said
all
right
mike
what
happening
in
derry
tell
us
can
tell
you
some
mike
said
can
tell
you
for
instance
what
happening
now
and
i
can
tell
you
some
things
about
yourselves
but
i
can't
tell
you
everything
that
happened
back
in
the
summer
of
and
i
don't
believe
i'll
ever
have
to
eventually
you'll
remember
it
for
yourselves
and
i
think
if
i
told
you
too
much
before
your
minds
were
ready
to
remember
what
happened
to
stan
might
happen
to
us
ben
asked
quietly
mike
nodded
yes
that
exactly
what
i'm
afraid
of
bill
said
then
tell
us
what
you
can
mike
all
right
he
said
i
will
the
losers
get
the
scoop
the
murders
have
started
again
mike
said
flatly
he
looked
up
and
down
the
table
and
then
his
eyes
fixed
on
bills
the
first
of
the
new
murders
if
you'll
allow
me
that
rather
grisly
conceit
began
on
the
main
street
bridge
and
ended
underneath
it
the
victim
was
a
gay
and
rather
childlike
man
named
adrian
mellon
he
had
a
bad
case
of
asthma
eddie
hand
stole
out
and
touched
the
side
of
his
aspirator
tt
happened
last
summer
on
july
st
the
last
night
of
the
canal
days
festival
which
was
a
kind
of
celebrationa...a
a
derry
ritual
bill
said
in
a
low
voice
his
long
fingers
were
slowly
massaging
his
temples
and
it
was
not
hard
to
guess
he
was
thinking
about
his
brother
george
george
who
had
almost
certainly
opened
the
way
the
last
time
this
had
happened
a
ritual
mike
said
quietly
yes
he
told
them
the
story
of
what
had
happened
to
adrian
mellon
quickly
watching
with
no
pleasure
as
their
eyes
got
bigger
and
bigger
he
told
them
what
the
news
had
reported
and
what
it
had
not
the
latter
including
the
testimony
of
don
hagarty
and
christopher
unwin
about
a
certain
clown
which
had
been
under
the
bridge
like
the
troll
in
the
fabled
story
of
yore
a
clown
which
had
looked
like
a
cross
between
ronald
mcdonald
and
bozo
according
to
hagarty
tt
was
him
ben
said
in
a
sick
hoarse
voice
tt
was
that
fucker
penny
wise
there
one
other
thing
mike
said
looking
at
bill
one
of
the
investigating
officers
the
one
who
actually
pulled
adrian
mellon
out
of
the
canal
was
a
town
cop
named
harold
gardener
oh
jesus
chris
bill
said
in
a
weak
teary
voice
bill
beverly
looked
at
him
then
put
a
hand
on
his
arm
her
voice
was
full
of
startled
concern
bill
what
wrong
harold
would
have
been
about
five
then
bill
said
his
stunned
eyes
searched
mike
face
for
confirmation
yes
what
is
it
bill
richie
asked
hhharold
gardener
was
the
sson
of
dave
gardener
bill
said
dave
lived
down
the
street
from
us
back
then
when
george
was
k
killed
he
was
the
one
who
got
to
juh
juh
to
my
brother
first
and
brought
him
up
to
the
house
wrapped
in
a
piece
of
ququilt
they
sat
silently
saying
nothing
beverly
put
a
hand
briefly
over
her
eyes
tt
all
fits
rather
too
well
doesn't
it
mike
said
finally
yes
bill
said
in
a
low
voice
it
fits
all
right
td
kept
tabs
on
the
six
of
you
over
the
years
as
i
said
mike
went
on
but
it
wasn't
until
then
that
i
began
to
understand
just
why
i
had
been
doing
it
that
it
had
a
real
and
concrete
purpose
still
i
held
off
waiting
to
see
how
things
would
develop
you
see
i
felt
that
i
had
to
be
absolutely
sure
before
i
disturbed
your
lives
not
ninety
percent
not
even
ninety
five
percent
one
hundred
was
all
that
would
do
it
in
december
of
last
year
an
eightyearold
boy
named
steven
johnson
was
found
dead
in
memorial
park
like
adrian
mellon
he
had
been
badly
mutilated
just
before
or
just
after
his
death
but
he
looked
as
if
he
could
have
died
of
just
plain
fright
sexually
assaulted
eddie
asked
no
just
plain
mutilated
how
many
in
all
eddie
asked
not
looking
as
if
he
really
wanted
to
know
it
bad
mike
said
how
man
bill
repeated
nine
so
far
it
can't
be
beverly
cried
i
would
have
read
about
it
in
the
paper
seen
it
on
the
mews
when
that
crazy
cop
killed
all
those
women
in
castle
rock
maine
and
those
children
that
were
murdered
in
atlanta
yes
that
mike
said
tve
thought
about
that
a
lot
it
really
the
closest
correlative
to
what
going
on
here
and
bev
right
that
really
was
coasttocoast
news
in
some
ways
the
atlanta
comparison
is
the
thing
about
all
of
this
that
frightens
me
the
most
the
murder
of
nine
children
we
should
have
tv
news
correspondents
here
and
phony
psychics
and
reporters
from
the
atlantic
monthly
and
rolling
stone
the
whole
media
circus
in
short
but
it
hasn't
happened
bill
said
n
mike
answered
it
hasn't
oh
there
was
a
sundaysupplement
piece
about
it
in
the
portland
sunday
telegram
and
another
one
in
the
boston
globe
after
the
last
two
a
boston
based
television
program
called
good
day
did
a
segment
this
february
on
unsolved
murders
and
one
of
the
experts
mentioned
the
derry
murders
but
only
passingly
and
he
certainly
gave
no
indication
of
knowing
there
had
been
a
similar
batch
of
murders
in
and
another
in
there
are
some
ostensible
reasons
of
course
atlanta
new
york
chicago
detroit
those
are
big
media
towns
and
in
big
media
towns
when
something
happens
it
makes
a
bang
there
isn't
a
single
tv
or
radio
station
in
derry
unless
you
count
the
little
fm
the
english
and
speech
department
runs
up
at
the
high
school
bangor
got
the
corner
on
the
market
when
it
comes
to
the
media
except
for
the
derry
news
eddie
said
and
they
all
laughed
but
we
all
know
that
doesn't
really
cut
it
with
the
way
the
world
is
today
the
communication
web
is
there
and
at
some
point
the
story
should
have
broken
nationally
but
it
didn't
and
i
think
the
reason
is
just
this
it
doesn't
want
it
to
bill
mused
almost
to
himself
tt
mike
agreed
if
we
have
to
call
it
something
it
might
as
well
be
what
we
used
to
call
it
i've
begun
to
think
you
see
that
it
has
been
here
so
long
whatever
it
really
is
that
it
become
a
part
of
derry
something
as
much
a
part
of
the
town
as
the
standpipe
or
the
canal
or
bassey
park
or
the
library
only
it
not
a
matter
of
outward
geography
you
understand
maybe
that
was
true
once
but
now
it
inside
somehow
it
gotten
inside
that
the
only
way
i
know
to
understand
all
of
the
terrible
things
that
have
happened
here
the
nominally
explicable
as
well
as
the
utterly
inexplicable
there
was
a
fire
at
a
negro
nightclub
called
the
black
spot
in
a
year
before
that
a
bunch
of
halfbright
depression
outlaws
was
gunned
down
on
canal
street
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
the
bradley
gang
bill
said
the
fbi
got
them
right
that
what
the
histories
say
but
that
not
precisely
true
so
far
as
i've
been
able
to
find
out
and
i'd
give
a
lot
to
believe
that
it
wasn't
so
because
i
love
this
town
the
bradley
gang
all
seven
of
them
were
actually
gunned
down
by
the
good
citizens
of
derry
i'll
tell
you
about
it
sometime
there
was
the
explosion
at
the
kitchener
ironworks
during
an
easteregg
hunt
in
there
was
a
horrible
series
of
animal
mutilations
that
same
year
that
was
finally
traced
to
andrew
rhulin
the
granduncle
of
the
man
who
now
runs
the
rhulin
farms
he
was
apparently
bludgeoned
to
death
by
the
three
deputies
who
were
supposed
to
bring
him
in
none
of
the
deputies
were
ever
brought
to
trial
mike
hanlon
produced
a
small
notebook
from
an
inner
pocket
and
paged
through
it
talking
without
looking
up
in
there
were
four
lynchings
inside
the
incorporated
town
limits
one
of
those
that
climbed
a
rope
was
the
lay
preacher
of
the
methodist
church
who
apparently
drowned
all
four
of
his
children
in
the
bathtub
as
if
they
were
kittens
and
then
shot
his
wife
in
the
head
he
put
the
gun
in
her
hand
to
make
it
look
like
suicide
but
no
one
was
fooled
a
year
before
that
four
loggers
were
found
dead
in
a
cabin
downstream
on
the
kenduskeag
literally
torn
apart
disappearances
of
children
of
whole
families
are
recorded
in
old
diary
extracts
but
not
in
any
public
document
it
goes
on
and
on
but
perhaps
you
get
the
idea
i
get
the
idea
all
right
ben
said
something
going
on
here
but
it
private
mike
closed
his
notebook
replaced
it
in
his
inner
pocket
and
looked
at
them
soberly
if
i
were
an
insurance
man
instead
of
a
librarian
i'd
draw
you
a
graph
maybe
it
would
show
an
unusually
high
rate
of
every
violent
crime
we
know
of
not
excluding
rape
incest
breaking
and
entering
auto
theft
child
abuse
spouse
abuse
assault
there
a
mediumsized
city
in
texas
where
the
violentcrimerate
is
far
below
what
you'd
expect
for
a
city
of
its
size
and
mixed
racial
makeup
the
extraordinary
placidity
of
the
people
who
live
there
has
been
traced
to
something
in
the
water
a
natural
trank
of
some
kind
the
exact
opposite
holds
true
here
derry
is
a
violent
place
to
live
in
an
ordinary
year
but
every
twentyseven
years
although
the
cycle
has
never
been
perfectly
exact
that
violence
has
escalated
to
a
furious
peak
and
it
has
never
been
national
news
you're
saying
there
a
cancer
at
work
here
beverly
said
not
at
all
an
untreated
cancer
invariably
kills
derry
hasn't
died
on
the
contrary
it
has
thrived
in
an
unspectacular
unnewsworthy
way
of
course
it
is
simply
a
fairly
prosperous
small
city
in
a
relatively
unpopulous
state
where
bad
things
happen
too
often
and
where
ferocious
things
happen
every
quarter
of
a
century
or
so
that
holds
true
all
down
the
line
ben
asked
mike
nodded
all
down
the
line
until
roughly
that
must
have
been
a
bad
one
and
on
and
on
right
up
to
the
present
time
i
have
a
feeling
that
it
been
getting
steadily
worse
maybe
because
there
have
been
more
people
in
derry
at
the
end
of
each
cycle
maybe
for
some
other
reason
and
in
the
cycle
appears
to
have
come
to
a
premature
end
for
which
we
were
responsible
bill
denbrough
leaned
forward
his
eyes
suddenly
bright
you're
sure
of
that
sure
'
yes
mike
said
all
the
other
cycles
reached
their
peak
around
september
and
then
ended
in
a
big
way
life
usually
took
on
its
more
or
less
normal
tenor
by
christmas
easter
at
the
latest
in
other
words
there
were
bad
years
of
fourteen
to
twenty
months
every
twenty
seven
years
but
the
bad
year
that
began
when
your
brother
was
killed
in
october
of
ended
quite
abruptly
in
august
of
wh
eddie
asked
urgently
his
breath
had
thinned
bill
remembered
that
high
whistle
as
eddie
inhaled
breath
and
knew
that
he
would
soon
be
tooting
on
the
old
lungsucker
what
did
we
do
the
question
hung
there
mike
seemed
to
regard
it
and
at
last
he
shook
his
head
you'll
remember
he
said
in
time
you'll
remember
what
if
we
don't
ben
asked
then
god
help
us
all
nine
children
dead
this
year
rich
said
christ
lisa
albrecht
and
steven
johnson
in
late
mike
said
in
february
a
boy
named
dennis
torrio
disappeared
a
highschool
boy
his
body
was
found
in
midmarch
in
the
barrens
mutilated
this
was
nearby
he
took
a
photograph
from
the
same
pocket
into
which
he
had
replaced
the
notebook
it
made
its
way
around
the
table
beverly
and
eddie
looked
at
it
puzzled
but
richie
tozier
reacted
violently
he
dropped
it
as
if
it
were
hot
jesus
jesus
mike
he
looked
up
his
eyes
wide
and
shocked
a
moment
later
he
passed
the
picture
to
bill
bill
looked
at
it
and
felt
the
world
swim
into
gray
tones
all
around
him
for
a
moment
he
was
sure
he
would
pass
out
he
heard
a
groan
and
knew
he
had
made
the
sound
he
dropped
the
picture
what
is
it
he
heard
beverly
saying
what
does
it
mean
bill
it
my
brother
school
picture
bill
said
at
last
it
juhgeorgie
the
picture
from
his
album
the
one
that
moved
the
one
that
winked
they
handed
it
around
again
then
while
bill
sat
as
still
as
stone
at
the
head
of
the
table
looking
out
into
space
it
was
a
photograph
of
a
photograph
the
picture
showed
a
tattered
school
photo
propped
up
against
a
white
background
smiling
lips
parted
to
exhibit
two
holes
where
new
teeth
had
never
grown
unless
they
grow
in
your
coffin
bill
thought
and
shuddered
on
the
margin
below
george
picture
were
the
words
school
friends
tt
was
found
this
year
beverly
asked
again
mike
nodded
and
she
turned
to
bill
when
did
you
last
see
it
bill
he
wet
his
lips
tried
to
speak
nothing
came
out
he
tried
again
hearing
the
words
echo
in
his
head
aware
of
the
stutter
coming
back
fighting
it
fighting
the
terror
i
haven't
seen
that
picture
since
that
spring
the
year
after
george
died
when
i
tried
to
show
it
to
richie
it
was
g
gone
there
was
an
explosive
gasping
sound
that
made
them
all
look
around
eddie
was
setting
his
aspirator
back
on
the
table
and
looking
slightly
embarrassed
eddie
kaspbrak
blasts
off
richie
cried
cheerfully
and
then
suddenly
and
eerily
the
voice
of
the
movietone
newsreel
narrator
came
from
rich
mouth
today
in
derry
a
whole
city
turns
out
for
asthmatics
on
parade
and
the
star
of
the
show
is
big
ed
the
snothead
known
all
over
new
england
as
he
stopped
abruptly
and
one
hand
moved
toward
his
face
as
if
to
cover
his
eyes
and
bill
suddenly
thought
no
no
that
not
it
not
to
cover
his
eyes
but
to
push
his
glasses
up
on
his
nose
the
glasses
that
aren't
even
there
anymore
oh
dear
christ
what
going
on
here
eddie
i'm
sorry
rich
said
that
was
cruel
i
don't
know
what
the
hell
i
was
thinking
about
he
looked
around
at
the
others
bewildered
mike
hanlon
spoke
into
the
silence
td
promised
myself
after
steven
johnson
body
was
discovered
that
if
anything
else
happened
if
there
was
one
more
clear
case
i
would
make
the
calls
that
i
ended
up
not
making
for
another
two
months
it
was
as
if
i
was
hypnotized
by
what
was
happening
by
the
consciousness
of
it
the
deliberateness
of
it
george
picture
was
found
by
a
fallen
log
less
than
ten
feet
from
the
torrio
boy
body
it
vasn't
hidden
quite
the
contrary
it
was
as
if
the
killer
wanted
it
to
be
found
as
i'm
sure
the
killer
did
how
did
you
get
the
police
photo
mike
ben
asked
that
what
it
is
isn't
it
yes
that
what
it
is
there
a
fellow
in
the
police
department
who
isn't
averse
to
making
a
little
extra
money
i
pay
him
twenty
bucks
a
month
all
that
i
can
afford
he
a
pipeline
the
body
of
dawn
roy
was
found
four
days
after
the
torrio
boy
mccarron
park
thirteen
years
old
decapitated
april
rd
of
this
year
adam
terrault
sixteen
reported
missing
when
he
didn't
come
home
from
band
practice
found
the
next
day
just
off
the
path
that
runs
through
the
greenbelt
behind
west
broadway
also
decapitated
may
th
frederick
cowan
two
and
a
half
found
in
an
upstairs
bathroom
drowned
in
the
toilet
oh
mike
beverly
cried
yeah
it
ba
he
said
almost
angrily
don't
you
think
i
know
that
the
police
are
convinced
that
it
couldn't
have
been
well
some
kind
of
accident
bev
asked
mike
shook
his
head
his
mother
was
hanging
clothes
in
the
back
yard
she
heard
sounds
of
a
struggle
heard
her
son
screaming
she
ran
as
fast
as
she
could
as
she
went
up
the
stairs
she
says
she
heard
the
sound
of
the
toilet
flushing
repeatedly
that
and
someone
laughing
she
said
it
didn't
sound
human
and
she
saw
nothing
at
al
eddie
asked
her
son
mike
said
simply
his
back
had
been
broken
his
skull
fractured
the
glass
door
of
the
showerstall
was
broken
there
was
blood
everywhere
the
mother
is
in
the
bangor
mental
health
institute
now
my
my
police
department
source
says
she
quite
lost
her
mind
no
fucking
wonder
richie
said
hoarsely
who
got
a
cigarette
beverly
gave
him
one
rich
it
it
with
hands
that
shook
badly
the
police
line
is
that
the
killer
came
in
through
the
front
door
while
the
cowan
boy
mother
was
hanging
her
clothes
in
the
back
yard
then
when
she
ran
up
the
back
stairs
he
supposedly
jumped
from
the
bathroom
window
into
the
yard
she'd
just
left
and
got
away
clean
but
the
window
is
only
one
of
those
halfsized
jobs
a
kid
of
seven
would
have
to
wriggle
to
get
through
it
and
the
drop
was
twentyfive
feet
to
a
stoneflagged
patio
rademacher
doesn't
like
to
talk
about
those
things
and
no
one
in
the
press
certainly
no
one
at
the
news
has
pressed
him
about
them
mike
took
a
drink
of
water
and
then
passed
another
picture
down
the
line
this
was
not
a
police
photograph
it
was
another
school
picture
it
showed
a
grinning
boy
who
was
maybe
thirteen
he
was
dressed
in
his
best
for
the
school
photo
and
his
hands
were
clean
and
folded
neatly
in
his
lap
but
there
was
a
devilish
little
glint
in
his
eyes
he
was
black
jeffrey
holly
mike
said
may
th
a
week
after
the
cowan
boy
was
killed
torn
open
he
was
found
in
bassey
park
by
the
canal
nine
days
after
that
may
nd
a
fifthgrader
named
john
feury
was
found
dead
out
on
neibolt
street
eddie
uttered
a
high
quavering
scream
he
groped
for
his
aspirator
and
knocked
it
off
the
table
it
rolled
down
to
bill
who
picked
it
up
eddie
face
had
gone
a
sickish
yellow
color
his
breath
whistled
coldly
in
his
throat
get
him
something
to
drink
ben
roared
somebody
get
him
but
eddie
was
shaking
his
head
he
triggered
the
aspirator
down
his
throat
his
chest
heaved
as
he
tore
in
a
gulp
of
air
he
triggered
the
aspirator
again
and
then
sat
back
eyes
half
closed
panting
til
be
all
right
he
gasped
gimme
a
minute
i'm
with
you
eddie
are
you
sure
beverly
asked
maybe
you
ought
to
lie
down
til
be
all
right
he
repeated
querulously
it
was
just
the
shock
you
know
the
shock
i'd
forgotten
all
about
neibolt
street
no
one
replied
no
one
had
to
bill
thought
you
believe
your
capacity
has
been
reached
and
then
mike
produces
another
name
and
yet
another
like
a
black
magician
with
a
hatful
of
malign
tricks
and
you're
knocked
onyour
ass
again
it
was
too
much
to
face
all
at
once
this
outpouring
of
inexplicable
violence
somehow
directly
aimed
at
the
six
people
here
or
so
george
photograph
seemed
to
suggest
both
of
john
feury
legs
were
gone
mike
continued
softly
but
the
medical
examiner
says
that
happened
after
he
died
his
heart
gave
out
he
seems
to
have
quite
literally
died
of
fear
he
was
found
by
the
postman
who
saw
a
hand
sticking
out
from
under
the
porch
tt
was
wasn't
it
rich
said
and
bill
looked
at
him
quickly
rich
glanced
back
at
him
nodded
slightly
and
then
looked
at
mike
again
twentynine
neibolt
street
oh
yes
mike
said
in
that
same
calm
voice
tt
was
number
he
drank
more
water
are
you
really
all
right
eddie
eddie
nodded
his
breathing
had
eased
rademacher
made
an
arrest
the
day
after
feury
body
was
discovered
mike
said
there
was
a
frontpage
editorial
in
the
news
that
same
day
calling
for
his
resignation
incidentally
after
eight
murders
ben
said
pretty
radical
of
them
wouldn't
you
say
beverly
wanted
to
know
who
had
been
arrested
a
guy
who
lives
in
a
little
shack
way
out
on
route
almost
over
the
town
line
and
into
newport
mike
said
kind
of
a
hermit
burns
scrapwood
in
his
stove
roofed
the
place
with
scavenged
shingles
and
hubcaps
name
of
harold
earl
probably
doesn't
see
two
hundred
dollars
in
cash
money
over
the
course
of
a
year
someone
driving
by
saw
him
standing
out
in
his
dooryard
just
looking
up
at
the
sky
on
the
day
john
feury
body
was
discovered
his
clothes
were
covered
with
blood
then
maybe
rich
began
hopefully
he
had
three
butchered
deer
in
his
shed
mike
said
he'd
been
jacking
over
in
haven
the
blood
on
his
clothes
was
deerblood
rademacher
asked
him
if
he
killed
john
feury
and
earl
is
supposed
to
have
said
oh
ayuh
i
killed
a
lot
of
people
i
shot
most
of
them
in
the
war
he
also
said
he'd
seen
things
in
the
woods
at
night
blue
lights
sometimes
floating
just
a
few
inches
off
the
ground
corpse
lights
he
called
them
and
bigfoot
they
sent
him
up
to
the
bangor
mental
health
according
to
the
medical
report
his
liver
almost
entirely
gone
he
been
drinking
paintthinner
oh
my
god
beverly
said
and
is
prone
to
hallucinations
they've
been
holding
on
to
him
amd
until
three
days
ago
rademacher
was
sticking
to
his
idea
that
earl
was
the
most
likely
suspect
he
had
eight
guys
out
there
digging
around
his
shack
and
looking
for
the
missing
heads
lampshades
made
out
of
human
skin
god
knows
what
mike
paused
head
lowered
and
then
went
on
his
voice
was
slightly
hoarse
now
td
held
off
and
held
off
but
when
i
saw
this
last
one
i
made
the
calls
i
wish
to
god
i'd
made
them
sooner
let
see
ben
said
abruptly
the
victim
was
another
fifthgrader
mike
said
a
classmate
of
the
feury
boy
he
was
found
just
off
kansas
street
near
where
bill
used
to
hide
his
bike
when
we
were
in
the
barrens
his
name
was
jerry
bellwood
he
was
torn
apart
what
what
was
left
of
him
was
found
at
the
foot
of
a
ement
retaining
wall
that
was
put
in
along
most
of
kansas
street
about
twenty
years
ago
to
stop
the
soil
erosion
this
police
photograph
of
the
section
of
that
wall
where
bellwood
was
found
was
taken
less
than
half
an
hour
after
the
body
was
removed
here
he
passed
the
picture
to
rich
tozier
who
looked
and
passed
it
on
to
beverly
she
glanced
at
it
briefly
winced
and
passed
it
on
to
eddie
who
gazed
at
it
long
and
raptly
before
handing
it
on
to
ben
ben
passed
it
to
bill
with
barely
a
glance
printing
straggled
its
way
across
the
concrete
retaining
wall
it
said
come
nome
come
lhom€
come
omy
bill
looked
up
at
mike
grimly
he
had
been
bewildered
and
frightened
now
he
felt
the
first
stirrings
of
anger
he
was
glad
angry
was
not
such
a
great
way
to
feel
but
it
was
better
than
the
shock
better
than
the
miserable
fear
is
that
written
in
what
i
think
it
written
i
yes
mike
said
jerry
bellwood
blood
richie
gets
beeped
mike
had
taken
his
photographs
back
he
had
an
idea
that
bill
might
ask
for
the
one
of
george
last
school
picture
but
bill
did
not
he
put
them
in
his
inside
jacket
pocket
and
when
they
were
out
of
sight
all
of
them
mike
included
felt
a
sense
of
relief
nine
children
beverly
was
saying
softly
i
can't
believe
it
i
mean
i
can
believe
it
but
i
can't
believe
it
nine
kids
and
nothing
nothing
at
all
it
not
quite
like
tha
mike
said
people
are
angry
people
are
scared
or
so
it
seems
it
really
impossible
to
tell
which
ones
really
feel
that
way
and
which
ones
are
faking
faking
beverly
do
you
remember
when
we
were
kids
the
man
who
just
folded
his
newspaper
and
went
inside
his
house
while
you
were
screaming
at
him
for
help
for
a
moment
something
seemed
to
jump
in
her
eyes
and
she
looked
both
terrified
and
aware
then
she
only
looked
puzzled
no
when
was
that
mike
never
mind
it
will
come
to
you
in
time
all
i
can
say
now
is
that
everything
iooks
the
way
it
should
in
derry
faced
with
such
a
grisly
string
of
murders
people
are
doing
all
the
things
you'd
expect
them
to
do
and
most
of
them
are
the
same
things
that
went
on
while
kids
were
disappearing
and
getting
murdered
back
in
the
save
our
children
committee
is
meeting
again
only
this
time
at
derry
elementary
school
instead
of
derry
high
there
are
sixteen
detectives
from
the
state
attorney
general
office
in
town
and
a
contingent
of
fbi
agents
as
well
i
don't
know
how
many
and
although
rademacher
talks
big
i
don't
think
he
does
either
the
curfew
back
in
effect
oh
yes
the
curfew
ben
was
rubbing
the
side
of
his
neck
slowly
and
deliberately
that
did
wonders
back
in
i
remember
that
much
and
there
are
mother
walker
groups
to
make
sure
that
every
child
who
goes
to
school
grades
k
through
eight
is
chaperoned
home
the
news
has
gotten
over
two
thousand
letters
demanding
a
solution
in
the
last
three
weeks
alone
and
of
course
the
outmigration
has
begun
again
i
sometimes
think
that
the
only
way
to
really
tell
who
sincere
about
wanting
it
stopped
and
who
isn't
the
really
sincere
ones
get
scared
and
leave
people
really
are
leaving
richie
asked
tt
happens
each
time
the
cycle
cranks
up
again
it
impossible
to
tell
just
how
many
go
because
the
cycle
hasn't
fallen
squarely
in
a
census
year
since
or
so
but
it
a
fairish
number
they
run
like
kids
who
just
found
out
the
house
was
haunted
for
real
after
all
come
home
come
home
come
home
beverly
said
softly
when
she
looked
up
from
her
hands
it
was
bill
she
looked
at
not
mike
it
wanted
us
to
come
back
why
it
may
want
us
all
back
mike
said
a
little
cryptically
sure
it
may
it
may
want
revenge
after
all
we
balked
it
once
before
revenge
or
just
to
set
things
back
in
order
bill
said
mike
nodded
things
are
out
of
order
with
your
own
lives
too
you
know
none
of
you
left
derry
untouched
without
its
mark
on
you
all
of
you
forgot
what
happened
here
and
your
memories
of
that
summer
are
still
only
fragmentary
and
then
there
the
passingly
curious
fact
that
you're
all
rich
oh
come
on
no
richie
said
that
hardly
be
soft
be
soft
mike
said
holding
his
hand
up
and
smiling
faintly
i'm
not
accusing
you
of
anything
just
trying
to
get
the
facts
out
on
the
table
you
are
rich
by
the
standards
of
a
smalltown
librarian
who
makes
just
under
eleven
grand
a
year
after
taxes
okay
rich
shrugged
the
shoulders
of
his
expensive
suit
uncomfortably
ben
appeared
deeply
absorbed
in
tearing
small
strips
from
the
edge
of
his
napkin
no
one
was
looking
directly
at
mike
except
bill
none
of
you
are
in
the
l
hunt
class
certainly
mike
said
but
you
are
all
welltodo
even
by
the
standards
of
the
american
uppermiddle
class
we're
all
friends
here
so
fess
up
if
there
one
of
you
who
declared
less
than
ninety
thousand
dollars
on
his
or
her
tax
return
raise
your
hand
they
glanced
around
at
each
other
almost
furtively
embarrassed
as
americans
always
seem
to
be
by
the
raw
fact
of
their
own
success
as
if
cash
were
hardcooked
eggs
and
affluence
the
farts
that
inevitably
follow
an
overdose
of
same
bill
felt
hot
blood
in
his
cheeks
and
was
helpless
to
stop
its
rise
he
had
been
paid
ten
thousand
more
than
the
sum
mike
had
mentioned
just
for
doing
the
first
draft
of
the
attic
room
screenplay
he
had
been
promised
an
additional
twenty
thousand
dollars
each
for
two
rewrites
if
needed
then
there
were
royalties
and
the
hefty
advance
on
a
twobook
contract
just
signed
how
much
had
he
declared
on
his
tax
return
just
about
eight
hundred
thousand
dollars
right
enough
anyway
to
seem
almost
monstrous
in
light
of
mike
hanlon
stated
income
of
just
under
eleven
thousand
a
year
so
that
how
much
they
pay
you
to
keep
the
lighthouse
mike
old
kid
bill
thought
jesus
christ
somewhere
along
the
line
you
should
have
asked
for
a
raise
mike
said
bill
denbrough
a
successful
novelist
in
a
society
where
there
are
only
a
few
novelists
and
fewer
still
lucky
enough
to
be
making
a
living
from
the
craft
beverly
rogan
who
in
the
rag
trade
a
field
to
which
more
are
called
but
even
fewer
chosen
she
is
in
fact
the
most
soughtafter
designer
in
the
middle
third
of
the
country
right
now
oh
it
not
me
beverly
said
she
uttered
a
nervous
little
laugh
and
lit
a
fresh
cigarette
from
the
smoldering
stub
of
the
old
one
it
tom
tom
the
one
without
him
i'd
still
be
relining
skirts
and
sewing
up
hems
i
don't
have
any
business
sense
at
all
even
tom
says
so
it
just
you
know
tom
and
luck
she
took
a
single
deep
drag
from
her
cigarette
and
then
snuffed
it
methinks
the
lady
doth
protest
too
much
richie
said
slyly
she
turned
quickly
in
her
seat
and
gave
him
a
hard
look
her
color
high
just
what
that
supposed
to
mean
richie
tozie
doan
hits

miz
scawlett
richie
cried
in
a
high
trembling
pickaninny
voice
and
in
that
moment
bill
could
see
with
an
eerie
clarity
the
boy
he
had
known
he
was
not
just
a
superseded
presence
lurking
under
rich
tozier
grownup
exterior
but
a
creature
almost
more
real
than
the
man
himself

beverly
said
coldly
you
ought
to
grow
up
richie
looked
at
her
his
grin
fading
slowly
into
uncertainty
until
i
came
back
here
he
said
i
thought
i
had
rich
you
may
just
be
the
most
successful
disc
jockey
in
the
united
states
mike
said
you've
certainly
got
la
in
the
palm
of
your
hand
on
top
of
that
there
are
two
syndicated
programs
one
of
them
a
straight
topforty
countdown
show
the
other
one
something
called
the
freaky
forty
you
better
watch
out
fool
richie
said
in
a
gruff
mr
voice
but
he
was
blushing
til
make
your
front
and
back
change
places
i'll
give
you
brainsurgery
with
my
fist
ti
eddie
mike
went
on
ignoring
richie
you've
got
a
healthy
limousine
service
in
a
city
where
you
just
about
have
to
elbow
long
black
cars
out
of
your
way
when
you
cross
the
street
two
limo
companies
a
week
go
smash
in
the
big
apple
but
you're
doing
fine
ben
you're
probably
the
most
successful
young
architect
in
the
world
ben
opened
his
mouth
probably
to
protest
and
then
closed
it
again
abruptly
mike
smiled
at
them
spread
his
hands
i
don't
want
to
embarrass
anyone
but
i
do
want
all
the
cards
on
the
table
there
are
people
who
succeed
young
and
there
are
people
who
succeed
in
highly
specialized
jobs
if
there
weren't
people
who
bucked
the
odds
successfully
i
guess
everybody
would
give
up
if
it
was
just
one
or
two
of
you
we
could
pass
it
off
as
coincidence
but
it
not
just
one
or
two
it
all
of
you
and
that
includes
stan
uris
who
was
the
most
successful
young
accountant
in
atlanta
which
means
in
the
whole
south
my
conclusion
is
that
your
success
stems
from
what
happened
here
twentyseven
years
ago
if
you
had
all
been
exposed
to
asbestos
at
that
time
and
tad
all
developed
lung
cancer
by
now
the
correlative
would
be
no
less
clear
or
persuasive
do
any
of
you
want
to
dispute
it
he
looked
at
them
no
one
answered
all
except
you
bill
said
what
happened
to
you
mikey
isn't
it
obvious
he
grinned
i
stayed
here
you
kept
the
lighthouse
ben
said
bill
jerked
around
and
looked
at
him
startled
but
ben
was
staring
hard
at
mike
and
didn't
see
that
doesn't
make
me
feel
so
good
mike
in
fact
it
makes
me
feel
sort
of
like
a
bugturd
amen
beverly
said
mike
shook
his
head
patiently
you
have
nothing
to
feel
guilty
about
any
of
you
do
you
think
it
was
my
choice
to
stay
here
any
more
than
it
was
your
choice
any
of
you
to
leave
hell
we
were
kids
for
one
reason
or
another
your
parents
moved
away
and
you
guys
were
part
of
the
baggage
they
took
along
my
parents
stayed
and
was
it
really
their
decision
any
of
them
i
don't
think
so
how
was
it
decided
who
would
go
and
who
would
stay
was
it
luck
fate
it
some
other
i
don't
know
but
it
wasn't
us
guys
so
quit
it
you're
not
not
bitter
eddie
asked
timidly
tve
been
too
busy
to
be
bitter
mike
said
tve
spent
a
long
time
watching
and
waiting
i
was
watching
and
waiting
even
before
i
knew
it
i
think
but
for
the
last
five
years
or
so
i've
been
on
what
you
might
call
red
alert
since
the
turn
of
the
year
i've
been
keeping
a
journal
and
when
a
man
writes
he
thinks
harder
or
maybe
just
more
specifically
and
one
of
the
things
i've
spent
time
writing
and
thinking
about
is
the
nature
of
it
it
changes
we
know
that
i
think
it
also
manipulates
and
leaves
its
marks
on
people
just
by
the
nature
of
what
it
is
the
way
you
can
smell
a
skunk
on
you
even
after
a
long
bath
if
it
lets
go
its
bag
of
scent
too
near
you
the
way
a
grasshopper
will
spit
bug
juice
into
your
palm
if
you
catch
it
in
your
hand
mike
slowly
unbuttoned
his
shirt
and
spread
it
wide
they
could
all
see
the
pinkish
scrawls
of
scar
across
the
smooth
brown
skin
of
his
chest
between
the
nipples
the
way
claws
leave
scars
he
said
the
werewolf
richie
almost
moaned
oh
christ
big
bill
the
werewolf
when
we
went
back
to
neibolt
street
wha
bill
asked
he
sounded
like
a
man
called
out
of
a
dream
what
richie
don't
you
remember
no
do
you
t...i
almost
do

looking
both
confused
and
scared
richie
subsided
are
you
saying
this
thing
isn't
evil
eddie
asked
mike
abruptly
he
was
staring
at
the
scars
as
if
hypnotized
that
it
just
some
part
of
the
the
natural
order
tt
no
part
of
a
natural
order
we
understand
or
condone
mike
said
rebuttoning
his
shirt
and
i
see
no
reason
to
operate
on
any
other
basis
than
the
one
we
do
understand
that
it
kills
kills
children
and
that
wrong
bill
understood
that
before
any
of
us
do
you
remember
bill
i
remember
that
i
wanted
to
kill
it
bill
said
and
for
the
first
time
and
ever
after
he
heard
the
pronoun
gain
propernoun
status
in
his
own
voice
but
i
didn't
have
much
of
a
world
view
on
the
subject
if
you
see
what
i
mean
i
just
wanted
to
kill
it
because
it
killed
george
and
do
you
still
bill
considered
this
carefully
he
looked
down
at
his
spread
hands
on
the
table
and
remembered
george
in
his
yellow
slicker
his
hood
up
the
paper
boat
with
its
thin
glaze
of
paraffin
in
one
hand
he
looked
up
at
mike
mm
more
than
ever
he
said
mike
nodded
as
if
this
were
exactly
what
he
had
expected
it
left
its
mark
on
us
it
worked
its
will
on
us
just
as
it
has
worked
its
will
on
this
whole
town
day
in
and
day
out
even
during
those
long
periods
when
it
is
asleep
or
hibernating
or
whatever
it
does
between
its
more
more
lively
periods
mike
raised
one
finger
but
if
it
worked
its
will
on
us
at
some
point
in
some
way
we
aho
worked
our
will
on
it
we
stopped
it
before
it
was
done
i
know
we
did
did
we
weaken
it
hurt
it
did
we
in
fact
almost
kill
it
i
think
we
did
i
think
we
came
so
close
to
killing
it
that
we
went
away
thinking
we
had
but
you
don't
remember
that
part
either
do
you
ben
asked
no
i
can
remember
everything
up
until
august
th
with
almost
perfect
clarity
but
from
then
until
september
th
or
so
when
school
was
called
in
again
everything
is
a
total
blank
it
isn't
murky
or
hazy
it
is
just
completely
gone
with
one
exception
i
seem
to
remember
bill
screaming
about
something
called
the
deadlights
bill
arm
jerked
convulsively
it
struck
one
of
his
empty
beer
bottks
and
the
bottle
shattered
on
the
floor
like
a
bomb
did
you
cut
yourself
beverly
asked
she
had
half
risen
no
he
said
his
voice
was
harsh
and
dry
his
arms
had
broken
out
in
gooseflesh
it
seemed
that
his
skull
had
somehow
grown
he
could
feel
the
deadlights
it
pressing
out
against
the
stretched
skin
of
his
face
in
steady
numbing
throbs
tii
pick
up
the
no
just
sit
down
he
wanted
to
look
at
her
and
couldn't
he
couldn't
take
his
eyes
off
mike
do
you
remenber
the
deadlights
bill
mike
asked
softly
n
he
said
his
mouth
felt
the
way
it
did
when
the
dentist
got
a
little
too
enthusiastic
with
the
novocaine
you
will
i
hope
to
god
i
don't
you
will
anyway
mike
said
but
for
now
no
not
me
either
do
any
of
you
one
by
one
they
shook
their
heads
but
we
did
something
mike
said
quietly
at
some
point
we
were
able
to
exercise
some
sort
of
group
will
at
some
point
we
achieved
some
special
understanding
whether
conscious
or
unconscious
he
stirred
restlessly
god
[
wish
stan
was
here
i
have
a
feeling
that
stan
with
his
ordered
mind
might
have
had
some
idea
maybe
he
did
beverly
said
maybe
that
why
he
killed
himself
maybe
he
understood
that
if
there
was
magic
it
wouldn't
work
for
grownups
think
it
could
though
mike
said
because
there
one
other
thing
we
six
have
in
common
i
wonder
if
any
of
you
have
realized
what
that
is
it
was
bill
turn
to
open
his
mouth
and
then
shut
it
again
go
on
mike
said
you
know
what
it
is
i
can
see
it
on
your
face
tm
not
sure
i
know
bill
replied
but
i
think
wwe're
all
childless
is
that
ih
it
there
was
a
moment
of
shocked
silence
yea
mike
said
that
it
jesus
christ
almighty
eddie
spoke
up
indignantly
what
in
the
world
does
that
have
to
do
with
the
price
of
beans
in
peru
what
gave
you
the
idea
that
everyone
in
the
world
has
to
have
kids
that
nuts
do
you
and
your
wife
have
children
mike
asked
if
you've
been
keeping
track
of
us
all
the
way
you
said
then
you
know
goddam
well
we
don't
but
i
still
say
it
doesn't
mean
a
damn
thing
have
you
tried
to
have
children
we
don't
use
birth
control
if
that
what
you
mean
eddie
spoke
with
an
oddly
moving
dignity
but
his
cheeks
were
flushed
it
just
so
happens
that
my
wife
is
a
little
oh
hell
she
a
lot
overweight
we
went
to
see
a
doctor
and
she
told
us
my
wife
might
never
have
kids
if
she
didn't
lose
some
weight
does
that
make
us
criminals
take
it
easy
eds
richie
soothed
and
leaned
toward
him
don't
call
me
eds
and
don't
you
dare
pinch
my
cheek
he
cried
rounding
on
richie
you
know
i
hate
that
i
always
hated
it
richie
recoiled
blinking
beverly
mike
asked
what
about
you
and
tom
no
children
she
said
also
no
birth
control
tom
wants
kids
and
so
do
i
of
course
she
added
hastily
glancing
around
at
them
quickly
bill
thought
her
eyes
seemed
overbright
almost
the
eyes
of
an
actress
giving
a
good
performance
it
just
hasn't
happened
yet
have
you
had
those
tests
ben
asked
her
oh
yes
of
course
she
said
and
uttered
a
light
laugh
that
was
almost
a
titter
and
in
one
of
those
leaps
of
comprehension
that
sometimes
come
to
people
who
are
gifted
with
both
curiosity
and
insight
bill
suddenly
understood
a
great
deal
about
beverly
and
her
husband
tom
alias
the
greatest
man
in
the
world
beverly
had
gone
to
have
fertility
tests
his
guess
was
that
the
greatest
man
in
the
world
had
refused
to
entertain
even
for
a
moment
the
notion
that
there
might
be
something
wrong
with
the
sperm
being
manufactured
in
the
sacred
sacs
what
about
you
and
your
wife
big
bill
rich
asked
been
trying
they
all
looked
at
him
curiously
because
his
wife
was
someone
they
knew
audra
was
by
no
means
the
bestknown
or
the
bestloved
actress
in
the
world
but
she
was
certainly
part
of
the
celebrity
coinage
that
had
somehow
replaced
talent
as
a
medium
of
exchange
in
the
latter
half
of
the
twentieth
century
there
had
been
a
picture
of
her
in
people
magazine
when
she
cut
her
hair
short
and
during
a
particularly
boring
stretch
in
new
york
the
play
she
had
been
planning
to
do
off
broadway
fell
through
she
had
done
a
weeklong
stint
on
holly
wood
squares
over
her
agent
strenuous
objections
she
was
a
stranger
whose
lovely
face
was
known
to
them
he
thought
beverly
looked
particularly
curious
we've
been
trying
off
and
on
for
the
last
six
years
bill
said
for
the
last
eght
months
or
so
it
been
off
because
of
the
movie
we
were
doing
attic
room
it
called
you
know
we
run
a
little
entertainment
syndic
every
day
from
fivefifteen
in
the
afternoon
until
fivethirt
richie
said
seein
stars
it
called
they
had
a
feature
on
that
damned
movie
just
last
week
husband
and
wife
working
happily
together
kind
of
thing
they
said
both
of
your
names
and
i
never
made
the
connection
funny
isn't
it
very
bill
said
anyway
audra
said
it
would
be
just
our
luck
if
she
caught
pregnant
while
we
were
in
preproduction
and
she
had
to
do
ten
weeks
of
strenuous
acting
and
being
momingsick
at
the
same
time
but
we
want
kids
yes
and
we've
tried
quite
hard
had
fertility
tests
ben
asked
uhhuh
four
years
ago
in
new
york
the
doctors
discovered
a
very
small
benign
tumor
in
audra
womb
and
they
said
it
was
a
lucky
thing
because
although
it
wouldn't
have
prevented
her
from
getting
pregnant
it
might
have
caused
a
tubal
pregnancy
she
and
i
are
both
fertile
though
eddie
repeated
stubbornly
it
doesn't
prove
a
goddam
thing
suggestive
though
ben
murmured
no
little
accidents
on
your
front
ben
bill
asked
he
was
shocked
and
amused
to
find
that
his
mouth
had
very
nearly
called
ben
haystack
instead
tve
never
been
married
i've
always
been
careful
and
there
have
been
no
paternity
suits
ben
said
beyond
that
i
don't
think
there
any
real
way
of
telling
you
want
to
hear
a
funny
story
richie
asked
he
was
smiling
but
here
was
no
smile
in
his
eyes
sure
bill
said
you
were
always
good
at
the
funny
stuff
richie
your
face
and
me
own
buttocks
boy
richie
said
in
the
irish
cop
voice
it
was
a
great
irish
cop
voice
you've
improved
out
of
all
measure
richie
bill
thought
as
a
kid
you
couldn't
do
an
irish
cop
no
matter
how
you
busted
your
brains
except
once
or
twice
when
the
deadlights
was
that
your
face
and
me
own
buttocks
just
keep
rememb
rin
that
compayrison
me
foine
bucko
ben
hanscom
suddenly
held
his
nose
and
cried
in
a
high
quavering
boyish
voice
beep
beep
richie
beepbeep
beepbee
after
a
moment
laughing
eddie
held
his
own
nose
and
joined
in
beverly
did
the
same
awright
awright
richie
cried
laughing
himself
awright
i
give
up
chrissak
oh
man
eddie
said
he
collapsed
back
in
his
chair
laughing
so
hard
he
was
almost
crying
we
gotcha
that
time
trashmouth
way
to
go
ben
ben
was
smiling
but
he
looked
a
little
bewildered
beepbee
bev
said
and
giggled
i
forgot
all
about
that
we
always
used
to
beep
you
richie
you
guys
never
appreciated
true
talent
that
all
richie
said
comfortably
as
in
the
old
days
you
could
knock
him
offbalance
but
he
vas
like
one
of
those
inflatable
joe
palooka
dolls
with
sand
in
the
base
he
floated
upright
again
almost
at
once
that
was
one
of
your
little
contributions
to
the
losers
club
wasn't
it
haystack
yeah
i
guess
it
was
what
a
man
richie
said
in
a
trembling
awestruck
voice
and
then
began
to
salaam
over
the
table
nearly
sticking
his
nose
in
his
teacup
each
time
he
went
down
what
a
man
oh
chillun
what
a
man
beepbeep
richie
ben
said
solemnly
and
then
exploded
laughter
in
a
hearty
baritone
utterly
unlike
his
wavering
childhood
voice
you're
the
same
old
roadrunner
you
guys
want
to
hear
this
story
or
not
richie
asked
i
mean
no
big
deal
one
way
or
the
other
beep
away
if
you
want
to
i
can
take
abuse
i
mean
you're
boking
at
a
man
who
once
did
an
interview
with
ozzy
osbourne
tell
it
bill
said
he
glanced
over
at
mike
and
saw
that
mike
looked
happier
or
more
at
rest
since
the
luncheon
had
begun
was
it
because
he
saw
the
almost
unconscious
knitting
together
that
was
happening
the
sort
of
easy
falling
back
into
old
roles
that
almost
never
happened
when
old
chums
got
together
bill
thought
so
and
he
thought
if
there
are
certain
preconditions
for
the
belief
in
magic
that
makes
it
possible
to
use
the
magic
then
maybe
those
preconditions
will
inevitably
arrange
themselves
it
was
not
a
very
comforting
thought
it
made
him
feel
like
a
man
strapped
to
the
nosecone
of
a
guided
missile
beepbeep
indeed
well
richie
was
saying
i
could
make
this
long
and
sad
or
i
could
give
you
the
blondie
and
dagwood
comicstrip
version
but
i'll
settle
for
something
in
the
middle
the
year
after
i
moved
out
to
california
i
met
a
girl
and
we
fell
pretty
hard
for
each
other
started
living
together
she
was
on
the
pill
at
first
but
it
made
her
feel
sick
almost
all
the
time
she
talked
about
getting
an
iud
but
i
wasn't
too
crazy
about
that
the
first
stories
about
how
they
might
not
be
completely
safe
were
just
starting
to
come
out
in
the
papers
we
had
talked
a
lot
about
kids
and
had
pretty
well
decided
we
didn't
want
them
even
if
we
decided
to
legalize
the
relationship
irresponsible
to
bring
kids
into
such
a
shitty
dangerous
overpopulated
world
and
blahblahblah
babblebabblebabble
let
go
out
and
put
a
bomb
in
the
men
room
of
the
bank
of
america
and
then
come
on
back
to
the
crashpad
and
smoke
some
dope
and
talk
about
the
difference
between
maoism
and
trotskyism
if
you
see
what
i
mean
or
maybe
i'm
being
too
hard
on
both
of
us
shit
we
were
young
and
reasonably
idealistic
the
upshot
was
that
i
got
my
wires
cut
as
the
beverly
hills
crowd
puts
it
with
their
unfailing
vulgar
chic
the
operation
went
with
no
problem
and
i
had
no
adverse
aftereffects
there
can
be
you
know
i
had
a
friend
whose
balls
swelled
up
to
roughly
the
size
of
the
tires
on
a
cadillac
i
was
gonna
give
him
a
pair
of
suspenders
and
a
couple
of
barrels
for
his
birthday
sort
of
a
designer
truss
but
they
went
down
before
then
all
put
with
your
customary
tact
and
dignity
bill
remarked
and
beverly
began
to
laugh
again
richie
offered
a
large
sincere
smile
thank
you
bill
for
those
words
of
support
the
word
fuck
was
used
two
hundred
and
six
times
in
your
last
book
i
counted
beepbeep
trashmouth
bill
said
solemnly
and
they
all
laughed
bill
found
it
nearly
impossible
to
believe
they
had
been
talking
about
dead
children
less
than
ten
minutes
ago
press
onward
richie
ben
said
the
hour
groweth
late
sandy
and
i
lived
together
for
two
and
a
half
years
richie
went
on
came
really
close
to
getting
married
twice
as
things
turned
out
i
guess
we
saved
ourselves
a
lot
of
heartache
and
all
that
communityproperty
bullshit
by
keeping
it
simple
she
got
an
offer
to
join
a
corporate
lawfirm
in
washington
around
the
same
time
i
got
an
offer
to
come
to
klad
as
a
weekend
jock
not
much
but
a
foot
in
the
door
she
told
me
it
was
her
big
chance
and
i
had
to
be
the
most
insensitive
male
chauvinist
oinker
in
the
united
states
to
be
dragging
my
feet
and
furthermore
she'd
had
it
with
california
anyway
i
told
her
i
also
had
a
chance
so
we
thrashed
it
out
and
we
trashed
each
other
out
and
at
the
end
of
all
the
thrashing
and
trashing
sandy
went
about
a
year
after
that
i
decided
try
and
get
the
vasectomy
reversed
no
real
reason
for
it
and
i
knew
from
the
stuff
i'd
read
that
the
chances
were
pretty
spotty
but
i
thought
what
the
hell
you
were
seeing
someone
steadily
then
bill
asked
no
that
the
funny
part
of
richie
said
frowning
i
just
woke
up
one
day
with
this
i
dunno
this
hobbyhorse
about
getting
it
reversed
you
must
have
been
nuts
eddie
said
general
anesthetic
instead
of
a
local
surgery
maybe
a
week
in
the
hospital
afterward
yeah
the
doctor
told
me
all
of
that
stuff
richie
replied
and
i
told
him
i
wanted
to
go
ahead
anyway
i
don't
know
why
the
doc
asked
me
if
i
understood
the
aftermath
of
the
operation
was
sure
to
be
painful
while
the
result
was
only
going
to
be
a
comtoss
at
best
i
said
i
did
he
said
okay
and
i
asked
him
when
my
attitude
being
the
sooner
the
better
you
know
so
he
says
hold
your
horses
son
hold
your
horses
the
first
step
is
to
get
a
sperm
sample
just
to
make
sure
the
reversal
operation
is
necessary
i
said
come
on
i
had
the
exam
after
the
vasectomy
it
worked
he
told
me
that
sometimes
the
vasa
reconnected
spontaneously
yo
mamma
i
says
nobody
ever
told
me
that
he
said
the
chances
were
very
small
infinitesimal
really
but
because
the
operation
was
so
serious
we
ought
to
check
it
out
so
i
popped
into
the
men
room
with
a
frederick
of
hollywood
catalogue
and
jerked
off
into
a
dixie
cup
beep
beep
richie
beverly
said
yeah
you're
right
richie
said
the
part
about
the
frederick
catalogue
is
a
lie
you
never
find
anything
that
good
in
a
doctor
office
anyway
the
doc
called
me
three
days
later
and
asked
me
which
i
wanted
first
the
good
news
or
the
bad
news
gimme
the
good
news
first
i
said
the
good
news
is
the
operation
won't
be
necessary
he
said
the
bad
news
is
that
anybody
you've
been
to
bed
with
over
the
last
two
or
three
years
could
hit
you
with
a
paternity
suit
pretty
much
at
will
are
you
saying
what
i
think
you're
saying
i
asked
him
tim
telling
you
that
you
aren't
shooting
blanks
and
haven't
been
for
quite
awhile
now
he
said
millions
of
little
wigglies
in
your
sperm
sample
your
days
of
going
gaily
in
bareback
with
no
questions
asked
have
temporarily
come
to
anend
richard
i
thanked
him
and
hung
up
then
i
called
sandy
in
washington
rich
she
says
to
me
and
richie
voice
suddenly
became
the
voice
of
this
girl
sandy
whom
none
of
them
had
ever
met
it
was
not
an
imitation
or
even
a
likeness
exactly
it
was
more
like
an
auditory
painting
it
great
to
hear
from
you
i
got
married
yeah
that
great
i
said
you
should
have
let
me
know
i
would
have
sent
you
a
blender
she
goes
same
old
richie
always
full
of
gags
so
i
said
sure
same
old
richie
always
full
of
gags
by
the
way
sandy
you
didn't
happen
to
have
a
kid
or
anything
after
you
left
la
did
you
or
maybe
an
unscheduled
d
and
c
or
something
that
gag
isn't
so
funny
rich
she
said
and
i
had
a
brainwave
that
she
was
getting
ready
to
hang
up
on
me
so
i
told
her
what
happened
she
started
laughing
only
this
time
it
was
real
hard
she
was
laughing
the
way
i
always
used
to
laugh
with
you
guys
like
somebody
had
told
her
the
world
biggest
bellybuster
so
when
she
finally
starts
slowing
down
i
ask
her
what
in
god
name
is
funny
it
just
so
wonderful
she
said
this
time
the
joke
on
you
after
all
these
years
the
joke
is
finally
on
records
tozier
how
many
bastards
have
you
sired
since
i
came
east
rich
i
take
it
that
means
you
still
haven't
experienced
the
joys
of
motherhood
i
ask
her
tm
due
in
july
she
says
were
there
any
more
questions
yeah
i
go
when
did
you
change
your
mind
about
the
immorality
of
bringing
children
into
such
a
shitty
world
when
i
finally
met
a
man
who
wasn't
a
shit
she
answers
and
hangs
up
bill
began
to
laugh
he
laughed
until
tears
rolled
down
his
cheeks
yea
richie
said
think
she
cut
it
off
quick
so
she'd
really
get
the
last
word
but
she
could
have
hung
on
the
line
all
day
i
know
when
i've
been
aced
i
went
back
to
the
doctor
a
week
later
and
asked
him
if
he
could
be
a
little
clearer
on
the
odds
against
that
sort
of
spontaneous
regeneration
he
said
he'd
talked
with
ome
of
his
colleagues
about
the
matter
it
turned
out
that
in
the
threeyear
period
the
california
branch
of
the
ama
logged
twentythree
reports
of
spontaneous
regeneration
six
of
those
turned
out
to
be
simply
botched
operations
six
others
were
either
hoaxes
or
cons
guys
looking
to
take
a
bite
out
of
some
doctor
bank
account
so
eleven
real
ones
in
three
years
eleven
out
of
how
many
beverly
asked
twentyeight
thousand
six
hundred
and
eightee
richie
said
calmly
silence
around
the
table
so
i
went
and
beat
irish
sweepstakes
odds
richie
said
and
still
no
kid
to
show
for
it
that
give
you
any
good
chucks
eds
eddie
began
stubbornly
it
still
doesn't
prove
n
bill
said
it
doesn't
prove
a
thng
but
it
certainly
suggests
a
link
the
question
is
what
do
we
do
now
have
you
thought
about
that
mike
tve
thought
about
it
sure
mike
said
but
it
was
impossible
to
decide
anything
until
you
all
got
together
again
and
talked
the
way
you've
been
doing
there
was
no
way
i
could
predict
how
this
reunion
would
go
until
it
actually
happened
he
paused
for
a
long
time
looking
thoughtfully
at
them
tve
got
one
idea
he
said
but
before
i
tell
you
what
it
is
i
think
we
have
to
agree
on
whether
or
not
we
have
business
to
do
here
do
we
want
to
try
again
to
do
what
we
tried
to
do
once
before
do
we
want
to
try
to
kill
it
again
or
do
we
just
divide
the
check
up
six
ways
and
go
back
to
what
we
were
doing
tt
seems
as
if
beverly
began
but
mike
shook
his
head
at
her
he
wasn't
done
you
have
to
understand
that
our
chances
of
success
are
impossible
to
predict
i
know
they're
not
good
just
as
i
know
they
would
have
been
a
little
better
if
stan
was
here
too
still
not
real
god
but
better
with
stan
gone
the
circle
we
made
that
day
is
broken
i
don't
really
think
we
can
destroy
it
or
even
send
it
away
for
a
little
while
as
we
did
before
with
a
broken
circle
i
think
it
will
kill
us
one
by
one
by
one
and
probably
in
some
extremely
horrible
ways
as
children
we
made
a
complete
circle
in
some
way
i
don't
understand
even
now
i
think
that
if
we
agree
to
go
ahead
we'll
have
to
try
to
form
a
smaller
circle
i
don't
know
if
that
can
be
done
i
believe
it
might
be
possible
to
think
we'd
done
it
only
to
discover
when
it
was
too
late
well
that
it
was
too
late
mike
regarded
them
again
eyes
sunken
and
tired
in
his
brown
face
so
i
think
we
need
to
take
a
vote
stay
and
try
it
again
or
go
home
those
are
the
choices
i
got
you
here
on
the
strength
of
an
old
promise
i
wasn't
even
sure
you'd
remember
but
i
can't
hold
you
here
on
the
strength
of
that
promise
the
results
of
that
would
be
worse
and
more
of
it
he
looked
at
bill
and
in
that
moment
bill
understood
what
was
coming
he
dreaded
it
was
helpless
to
stop
it
and
then
with
the
same
feeling
of
relief
he
imagined
must
come
to
a
suicide
when
he
takes
his
hands
off
the
wheel
of
the
speeding
car
and
simply
uses
them
to
cover
his
eyes
he
accepted
it
mike
had
gotten
them
here
mike
had
laid
it
all
neatly
out
for
them
and
now
he
was
relinquishing
the
mantle
of
leadership
he
intended
that
mantle
to
go
back
to
the
person
who
had
worn
it
in
what
do
you
say
big
bill
call
the
question
before
i
d
bill
said
ddoes
everyone
understand
the
question
you
were
going
to
say
something
bev
she
shook
her
head
all
right
i
¢
guess
the
question
is
do
we
stay
and
fight
or
do
we
forget
the
whole
thing
those
in
favor
of
staying
no
one
at
the
table
moved
at
all
for
perhaps
five
seconds
and
bill
was
reminded
of
auctions
he
had
attended
where
the
price
on
an
item
suddenly
soared
into
the
stratosphere
and
those
who
didn't
want
to
bid
anymore
almost
literally
played
statues
one
was
afraid
to
scratch
an
itch
or
wave
a
fly
off
the
end
of
one
nose
for
fear
the
auctioneer
would
take
it
for
another
five
grand
or
twentyfive
bill
thought
of
georgie
georgie
who
had
meant
no
one
any
harm
who
had
only
wanted
to
get
out
of
the
house
after
being
cooped
up
all
week
georgie
with
his
color
high
his
newspaper
boat
in
one
hand
snapping
the
buckles
of
his
yellow
rainslicker
with
die
other
georgie
thanking
him
and
then
bending
over
and
kissing
bill
feverheated
cheek
thanks
bill
it
a
neat
boat
he
felt
the
old
rage
rise
in
him
but
he
was
older
now
and
his
perspective
was
wider
it
wasn't
just
georgie
now
a
horrid
slew
of
names
marched
through
his
head
betty
ripsom
found
frozen
into
the
ground
cheryl
lamonica
fished
out
of
the
kenduskeag
matthew
clements
torn
from
his
tricycle
veronica
grogan
nine
years
old
and
found
in
a
sewer
steven
johnson
lisa
albrecht
all
the
others
and
god
only
knew
how
many
of
the
missing
he
raised
his
hand
slowly
and
said
let
kill
it
this
time
let
really
kill
it
for
a
moment
his
hand
hung
there
alone
like
the
hand
of
the
only
kid
in
class
who
knows
the
right
answer
the
one
all
the
other
kids
hate
then
richie
sighed
raised
his
own
hand
and
said
what
the
hell
it
can't
be
any
worse
than
interviewing
ozzy
osbourne
beverly
raised
her
hand
her
color
was
back
now
but
in
hectic
patches
that
flared
along
her
cheekbones
she
looked
both
tremendously
excited
and
scared
to
death
mike
raised
his
hand
ben
raised
his
eddie
kaspbrak
sat
back
in
his
chair
looking
as
if
he
wished
he
could
actually
melt
into
it
and
thus
disappear
his
face
thin
and
delicatelooking
was
miserably
afraid
as
he
looked
first
right
and
then
left
and
then
back
to
bill
for
a
monent
bill
felt
sure
eddie
was
simply
going
to
push
back
his
chair
rise
and
bolt
from
the
room
without
looking
back
then
he
raised
one
hand
in
the
air
and
grasped
his
aspirator
tightly
in
the
other
way
to
go
ed
richie
said
we're
really
gonna
lave
ourselves
some
chucks
this
time
i
bet
beep
beep
richi
eddie
said
in
a
wavering
voice
the
losers
get
dessert
so
what
your
one
idea
mike
bill
asked
the
mood
had
been
broken
by
rose
the
hostess
who
had
come
in
with
a
dish
of
fortune
cookies
she
looked
around
at
the
six
people
who
had
their
hands
in
the
air
with
a
carefully
polite
lack
of
curiosity
they
lowered
them
hastily
and
no
one
said
anything
until
rose
was
gone
again
tt
simple
enough
mike
said
but
it
might
be
pretty
damn
dangerous
too
spill
itrichie
said
i
think
we
ought
to
split
up
for
the
rest
of
the
day
i
think
each
of
us
ought
to
go
back
to
the
place
in
derry
he
or
she
remembers
best
outside
the
barrens
that
is
i
don't
think
any
of
us
should
go
there
not
yet
think
of
it
as
a
series
of
walking
tours
if
you
like
what
the
purpose
mike
ben
asked
tm
not
entirely
sure
you
have
to
understand
that
i'm
going
pretty
much
on
intuition
here
but
this
has
got
a
good
beat
and
you
can
dance
to
it
richie
said
the
others
smiled
mike
did
not
he
nodded
instead
that
as
good
a
way
of
putting
it
as
any
going
on
intuition
is
like
picking
up
a
beat
and
dancing
to
it
using
intuition
is
a
hard
thing
for
grownups
to
do
and
that
the
main
reason
i
think
it
might
be
the
right
thing
for
us
to
do
kids
after
all
operate
on
it
about
eighty
percent
of
the
time
at
least
until
they're
fourteen
or
so
you're
talking
about
plugging
back
into
the
situation
eddie
said
i
suppose
so
anyway
that
my
idea
if
no
specific
place
to
go
comes
to
you
just
follow
your
feet
and
see
where
they
take
you
then
we
meet
tonight
at
the
library
and
talk
over
what
happened
if
anything
happens
ben
said
oh
i
think
things
will
what
sort
of
things
bill
asked
mike
shook
his
head
i
have
no
idea
i
think
whatever
happens
is
apt
to
be
unpleasant
i
think
it
even
possible
that
one
of
us
may
not
turn
up
at
the
library
tonight
no
reason
for
thinking
that
except
that
intuition
thing
again
silence
greeted
this
why
alone
beverly
asked
finally
if
we're
supposed
to
do
this
as
a
group
why
do
you
want
us
to
start
alone
mike
especially
if
the
risk
really
turns
out
to
be
as
high
as
you
think
it
might
be
i
think
i
can
answer
that
bill
said
go
ahead
bill
mike
said
it
started
alone
for
each
of
us
bill
said
to
beverly
i
don't
remember
everything
not
yet
but
i
sure
remember
that
much
the
picture
in
george
room
that
moved
ben
mummy
the
leper
that
eddie
saw
under
the
porch
on
neibolt
street
mike
finding
the
blood
on
the
grass
near
the
canal
in
bassey
park
and
the
bird
there
was
something
about
a
bird
wasn't
there
mike
mike
nodded
grimly
a
big
bird
yes
but
not
as
friendly
as
the
one
on
sesame
street
richie
cackled
wildly
derry
answer
to
james
brown
gets
off
a
good
one
oh
chillun
is
we
blessed
or
is
we
blessed
beep
beep
richie
mike
said
and
richie
subsided
for
you
it
was
the
voice
from
the
pipe
and
the
blood
that
came
out
of
the
drain
bill
said
to
beverly
and
for
richie
but
here
he
paused
puzzled
i
must
be
the
exception
that
proves
the
rule
big
bill
richie
said
the
first
time
icame
in
contact
with
anything
that
summer
that
was
weird
i
mean
really
bigleague
weird
was
in
george
room
with
you
when
you
and
i
went
back
to
your
house
that
day
and
looked
at
his
photo
album
the
picture
of
center
street
by
the
canal
started
to
move
do
you
remember
yes
bill
said
but
are
you
sure
there
was
nothing
before
that
richie
nothing
at
all
i
something
flickered
in
richie
eyes
he
said
slowly
well
there
was
the
day
henry
and
his
friends
chased
me
before
the
end
of
school
this
was
and
i
got
away
from
them
in
the
toy
department
of
freese
i
went
up
by
city
center
and
sat
down
on
a
park
bench
for
awhile
and
i
thought
i
saw
but
that
was
just
something
i
dreamed
what
was
i
beverly
asked
nothing
richie
said
almost
brusquely
a
dream
really
he
looked
at
mike
i
don't
mind
taking
a
walk
though
it'll
kill
the
afternoon
views
of
the
old
homestead
so
we're
agreed
bill
asked
they
nodded
and
we'll
meet
at
the
library
tonight
at
when
do
you
suggest
mike
seven
o'clock
ring
the
bell
if
you're
late
the
libe
closes
at
seven
on
weekdays
until
summer
vacation
starts
for
the
kids
seven
it
is
bill
said
and
let
his
eyes
range
soberly
over
them
and
be
careful
you
want
to
remember
that
none
of
us
really
knows
what
we're
dddoing
think
of
this
as
reconnaissance
if
you
should
see
something
don't
fight
run
t'm
a
lover
not
a
fighter
richie
said
in
a
dreamy
michael
jackson
voice
well
f
we're
going
to
do
it
we
ought
to
get
going
ben
said
a
small
smile
pulled
up
the
left
corner
of
his
mouth
it
was
more
bitter
than
amused
although
i'll
be
damned
if
i
could
tell
you
right
this
minute
where
i'm
going
to
go
if
the
barrens
are
out
that
was
the
best
of
it
for
me
going
down
there
with
you
guys
his
eyes
moved
to
beverly
held
there
for
a
moment
moved
away
i
can't
think
of
anyplace
else
that
means
very
much
to
me
probably
i'll
just
wander
around
for
a
couple
of
hours
looking
at
buildings
and
getting
wet
feet
you'll
find
a
place
to
go
haystack
richie
said
visit
some
of
your
old
foodstops
and
gas
up
ben
laughed
my
capacity
gone
down
a
lot
since
i
was
eleven
i'm
so
full
you
guys
may
just
have
to
roll
me
out
of
here
well
i'm
all
set
eddie
said
wait
a
se
beverly
cried
as
they
began
to
push
back
from
their
chairs
the
fortune
cookies
don't
forget
those
yea
richie
said
i
can
see
mine
now
you
will
soon
be
eaten
up
by
a
large
monster
have
a
nice
day
they
laughed
and
mike
passed
the
little
bowl
of
fortune
cookies
to
richie
who
took
one
and
then
sent
it
on
around
the
table
bill
noticed
that
no
one
opened
his
or
her
cookie
until
each
had
one
they
sat
with
the
little
hatshaped
cookies
either
in
front
of
them
or
held
in
their
hands
and
even
as
beverly
still
smiling
picked
hers
up
bill
felt
a
cry
rising
in
his
throat
no
no
don't
do
that
its
part
of
it
put
it
back
don't
open
it
but
it
was
too
late
beverly
had
broken
hers
open
ben
was
doing
the
same
to
his
eddie
was
cutting
into
his
with
the
edge
of
his
fork
and
just
before
beverly
smile
turned
to
a
grimace
of
horror
bill
had
time
to
think
we
knew
somehow
we
knew
because
no
one
simply
bit
into
his
or
her
fortune
cookie
that
would
have
been
the
normal
thing
to
do
but
no
one
did
it
somehow
some
pan
of
us
still
remembers
everything
and
he
found
that
insensate
underknowledge
somehow
the
most
horrifying
realization
of
all
it
spoke
more
eloquently
than
mike
could
have
about
how
surely
and
deeply
it
had
touched
each
one
of
them
and
how
its
touch
was
still
upon
them
blood
spurted
up
from
beverly
fortune
cookie
as
if
from
a
slashed
artery
it
splashed
across
her
hand
and
then
gouted
onto
the
white
napery
which
covered
the
table
staining
it
a
bright
red
that
sank
in
and
then
spread
out
in
grasping
pink
fingers
eddie
kaspbrak
uttered
a
strangled
cry
and
pushed
himself
away
from
the
table
with
such
a
sudden
revolted
confusion
of
arms
and
legs
that
his
chair
nearly
tipped
over
a
huge
bug
its
chitinous
carapace
an
ugly
yellowbrown
was
pushing
its
way
out
of
his
fortune
cookie
as
if
from
a
cocoon
its
obsidian
eyes
stared
blindly
forward
as
it
lurched
onto
eddie
bread
andbutter
plate
okie
crumbs
fell
from
its
back
in
a
little
shower
that
bill
heard
clearly
and
which
came
back
to
haunt
his
dreams
when
he
slept
for
awhile
later
that
afternoon
as
it
freed
itself
entirely
it
rubbed
its
thin
rear
legs
together
producing
a
dry
reedy
hum
and
bill
realized
it
was
some
sort
of
terribly
mutated
cricket
it
lumbered
to
the
edge
of
the
dish
and
tumbled
onto
the
tablecloth
on
its
back
oh
god
richie
managed
in
a
choked
voice
oh
god
big
bill
it
an
eye
dear
god
it
an
eye
a
fucking
eye
bill
head
snapped
around
and
he
saw
richie
staring
down
at
his
fortune
cookie
his
lips
drawn
back
from
his
teeth
in
a
kind
of
sickened
leer
a
chunk
of
his
cookie
glazed
surface
had
fallen
onto
the
tablecloth
revealing
a
hole
from
which
a
human
eyeball
stared
with
glazed
intensity
cookie
crumbs
were
scattered
across
its
blank
brown
iris
and
embedded
in
its
sclera
ben
hanscom
threw
his
not
a
calculated
throw
but
the
startled
reaction
of
a
person
who
has
been
utterly
surprised
by
some
pece
of
nasty
work
as
his
fortune
cookie
rolled
across
the
table
bill
saw
two
teeth
inside
its
hollow
their
roots
dark
with
clotted
blood
they
raided
together
like
seeds
in
a
hollow
gourd
he
looked
back
at
beverly
and
saw
she
was
hitching
in
breath
to
scream
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
thing
that
had
crawled
out
of
eddie
cookie
the
thing
that
was
now
kicking
its
sluggish
legs
as
it
lay
overturned
on
the
tablecloth
bill
got
moving
he
was
not
thinking
only
reacting
intuition
he
thought
crazily
as
he
lunged
out
of
his
seat
and
clapped
his
hand
over
beverly
mouth
just
before
she
could
utter
the
scream
here
i
am
acting
on
intuition
mike
should
be
proud
of
me
what
came
out
of
beverly
mouth
was
not
a
scream
but
a
strangled
mmmmp
eddie
was
making
those
whistling
sounds
that
bill
remembered
so
well
no
problem
there
a
good
honk
on
the
old
lungsucker
would
set
eddie
right
right
as
a
trivet
freddie
firestone
would
have
said
and
bill
wondered
not
for
the
first
time
why
a
person
had
such
weird
thoughts
at
times
like
these
he
glanced
around
fiercely
at
the
others
and
what
came
out
was
something
else
from
that
summer
something
that
sounded
both
impossibly
archaic
and
exactly
right
dummy
up
all
of
you
not
one
sound
just
dummy
up
rich
wiped
a
hand
across
his
mouth
mike
complexion
had
gone
a
dirty
gray
but
he
nodded
at
bill
all
of
them
moved
away
from
the
table
bill
had
not
opened
his
own
fortune
cookie
but
now
he
could
see
its
sides
moving
slowly
in
and
out
bulge
and
relax
bulge
and
relax
bulge
and
relax
as
his
own
partyfavor
tried
to
escape
mmmmmp
beverly
said
against
his
hand
again
her
breath
tickling
his
palm
dummy
up
bev
he
said
and
took
his
hand
away
her
face
seemed
to
le
all
eyes
her
mouth
twitched
bill
bill
did
you
see
her
eyes
strayed
back
to
the
cricket
and
then
fixed
there
the
cricket
appeared
to
be
dying
its
rugose
eyes
stared
back
at
her
and
presently
beverly
began
to
moan
quhquhquit
that
he
said
grimly
pull
back
to
the
table
tcan't
billy
i
can't
get
near
that
thi
you
can
you
hhave
he
heard
footsteps
light
and
quick
coming
up
the
short
hall
on
the
other
side
of
the
beaded
curtain
he
looked
around
at
the
cthers
all
of
you
pull
up
to
the
table
talk
look
natural
beverly
looked
at
him
eyes
pleading
and
bill
shook
his
head
he
sat
down
and
pulled
his
chair
in
trying
not
to
look
at
the
fortune
cookie
on
his
plate
it
had
swelled
like
some
unimaginable
boil
which
was
filling
with
pus
and
still
it
pulsed
slowly
in
and
out
j
could
have
bitten
into
that
he
thought
faintly
eddie
triggered
his
aspirator
down
his
throat
again
gasping
mist
into
his
lungs
in
a
long
thin
screaming
sound
so
who
do
you
think
going
to
win
the
pennant
bill
asked
mike
smiling
insanely
rose
came
through
the
curtain
just
then
her
face
politely
questioning
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
bill
saw
that
bev
had
pulled
up
to
the
table
again
good
girl
he
thought
i
think
the
chicago
bears
look
goo
mike
said
everything
is
all
right
rose
asked
ffin
bill
said
he
cocked
a
thumb
in
eddie
direction
our
friend
had
an
asthma
attack
he
took
his
medication
he
better
now
rose
looked
at
eddie
concerned
better
eddie
wheezed
you
would
like
that
i
clear
now
very
shortly
mike
said
and
offered
a
large
false
smile
was
good
her
eyes
surveyed
the
table
again
a
bit
of
doubt
overlaying
a
deep
well
of
serenity
she
did
not
see
the
cricket
the
eye
the
teeth
or
the
way
bill
fortune
cookie
appeared
to
be
breathing
her
eye
similarly
passed
over
the
bloodstain
splotched
on
the
tablecloth
without
trouble
everything
was
very
good
beverly
said
and
smiled
a
more
natural
smile
than
either
bill
or
mike
it
seemed
to
set
rose
mind
at
rest
convinced
her
that
if
something
had
gone
wrong
in
here
it
had
been
the
fault
of
neither
rose
service
nor
her
kitchen
girl
got
a
lot
of
guts
bill
thought
fortunes
were
good
rose
asked
well
richie
said
i
don't
know
about
the
others
but
i
for
one
got
a
real
eyeful
bill
heard
a
minute
cracking
sound
he
looked
down
at
his
plate
and
saw
a
leg
poking
blindly
out
of
his
fortune
cookie
it
scraped
at
his
plate
i
could
have
bitten
into
that
he
thought
again
but
held
onto
his
smile
very
fine
he
said
richie
was
looking
at
bill
plate
a
great
grayishblack
fly
was
slowing
birthing
itself
from
the
collapsing
remains
of
his
cookie
it
buzzed
weakly
yellowish
goo
flowed
sluggishly
out
of
the
cookie
and
puddled
on
the
tablecloth
there
was
a
smell
now
the
bland
thick
smell
of
an
infected
wound
well
if
i
can
help
you
in
no
way
at
this
moment

not
right
now
ben
said
a
wonderful
meal
most
most
unusual
i
leave
you
then
she
said
and
bowed
out
through
the
beaded
curtain
the
beads
were
still
swaying
and
clacking
together
when
all
of
them
pushed
away
from
the
table
again
what
is
it
ben
asked
huskily
looking
at
the
thing
on
bill
plate
a
fly
bill
said
a
mutant
fly
courtesy
of
a
writer
named
george
langlahan
i
think
he
wrote
a
story
called
the
fly
a
movie
was
made
out
of
it
not
a
terribly
good
one
but
the
story
scared
the
bejesus
out
of
me
it
up
to
its
old
tricks
all
right
that
fly
business
has
been
on
my
mind
a
lot
lately
because
i've
sort
of
been
planning
this
novel
roadbugs
i've
been
thinking
of
calling
it
i
know
the
title
sounds
ppretty
stupid
but
you
see
excuse
m
beverly
said
distantly
i
have
to
vomit
i
think
she
was
gone
before
any
of
the
men
could
rise
bill
shook
out
his
napkin
and
threw
it
over
the
fly
which
was
the
size
of
a
baby
sparrow
nothing
so
large
could
have
come
from
something
æ
small
as
a
chinese
fortune
cookie
but
it
had
it
buzzed
twice
under
the
napkin
and
then
fell
silent
jesus
eddie
said
faintly
let
get
the
righteous
fuck
out
of
here
mike
said
we
can
meet
bev
in
the
lobby
beverly
was
just
coming
out
of
the
women
room
as
they
gathered
by
the
cash
register
she
looked
pale
but
composed
mike
paid
the
check
kissed
rose
cheek
and
then
they
all
went
out
into
the
rainy
afternoon
does
this
change
anyone
mind
mike
asked
i
don't
think
it
changes
mine'ben
said
n
eddie
said
what
mind
richie
said
bill
shook
his
head
and
then
looked
at
beverly
tm
staying
she
said
bill
what
did
you
mean
when
you
said
it
up
to
its
old
tricks
tve
been
thinking
about
writing
a
bug
story
he
said
that
langlahan
story
had
woven
itself
into
my
thinking
and
so
i
saw
a
fly
yours
was
blood
beverly
why
was
blood
on
your
mind
i
guess
because
of
the
blood
from
the
drain
beverly
said
at
once
the
blood
that
came
out
of
the
bathroom
drain
in
the
old
place
when
i
was
eleven
but
was
that
really
it
she
didn't
really
think
so
because
what
had
flashed
immediately
to
mind
when
the
blood
spurted
across
her
fingers
in
a
warm
little
jet
had
been
the
bloody
footprint
she
had
left
behind
her
after
stepping
on
the
broken
perfume
bottle
tom
and
bevvie
sometimes
i
worry
alot
her
father
you
got
a
bug
too
bill
said
to
eddie
why
not
just
a
bug
eddie
said
a
cricket
there
are
crickets
in
our
basement
twohundred
thousanddollar
house
and
we
can't
get
rid
of
the
crickets
they
drive
us
crazy
at
night
a
couple
of
nights
before
mike
called
i
had
a
really
terrible
nightmare
i
dreamed
i
woke
up
and
my
bed
was
full
of
crickets
i
was
tryng
to
shoot
them
with
my
aspirator
but
all
it
would
do
when
i
squeezed
it
was
make
crackling
noises
and
just
before
i
woke
up
i
realized
it
was
full
of
crickets
too
the
hostess
didn't
see
any
of
it
ben
said
he
looked
at
beverly
like
your
foks
never
saw
the
blood
that
came
out
of
the
drain
even
though
it
was
everywhere
ye
she
said
they
stood
looking
at
each
other
in
the
fine
spring
rain
mike
looked
at
his
watch
there'll
be
a
bus
in
twenty
minutes
or
s
he
said
or
i
can
take
four
of
you
in
my
car
if
we
cram
or
i
can
call
some
cabs
whatever
way
you
want
to
do
it
i
think
i'm
going
to
walk
from
here
bill
said
i
don't
know
where
i'm
going
but
a
little
fresh
air
seems
like
a
great
idea
along
about
now
tm
going
to
call
a
ca
ben
said
ti
share
it
with
you
if
you'll
drop
me
off
downtown
richie
said
okay
where
you
going
richie
shrugged.'not
really
sure
yet
the
others
elected
to
wait
for
the
bus
seven
tonight
mike
reminded
and
be
careful
all
of
you
they
agreed
to
be
careful
although
bill
did
not
know
how
you
could
truthfully
make
a
promise
like
that
when
dealing
with
such
a
formidable
array
of
unknown
factors
he
started
to
say
so
then
looked
at
their
faces
and
saw
that
they
knew
it
already
he
walked
away
instead
raising
one
hand
briefly
in
farewell
the
misty
air
felt
good
against
his
face
the
walk
back
to
town
would
be
a
long
one
but
that
was
all
right
he
had
a
lot
to
think
about
he
was
glad
that
the
reunion
was
over
and
the
business
had
begun
chapter
walking
tours
ben
hanscom
makes
a
withdrawal
richie
tozier
got
out
of
the
cab
at
the
threeway
intersection
of
kansas
street
center
street
and
main
street
and
ben
dismissed
it
at
the
top
of
upmile
hill
the
driver
was
bill
religious
fella
but
neither
richie
nor
ben
knew
it
dave
had
lapsed
into
a
morose
silence
ben
could
have
gotten
off
with
richie
he
supposed
but
it
seemed
better
somehow
that
they
all
start
off
alone
he
stood
on
the
corner
of
kansas
street
and
daltrey
close
watching
the
cab
pull
back
into
traffic
hands
stuffed
deeply
into
his
pockets
trying
to
get
the
lunch’s
hideous
conclusion
out
of
his
mind
he
couldn't
do
it
his
thoughts
kept
returning
to
that
black
gray
fly
crawling
out
of
the
fortune
cookie
on
bill
plate
its
veined
wings
plastered
to
its
back
he
would
try
to
divert
his
mind
from
this
unhealthy
image
think
he
had
succeeded
only
to
discover
five
minutes
later
that
his
mind
was
back
at
it
i'm
trying
to
justify
it
somehow
he
thought
meaning
it
not
in
the
moral
sense
but
rather
in
the
mathematical
one
buildings
are
built
by
observing
certain
natural
laws
natural
laws
may
be
expressed
by
equations
equations
must
be
justified
where
was
the
justification
in
what
had
happened
less
than
half
an
hour
ago
let
it
alone
he
told
himself
not
for
the
first
time
you
can't
justify
it
so
let
it
alone
very
good
advice
the
problem
was
that
he
couldn't
take
it
he
remembered
that
the
day
after
he
had
seen
the
mummy
on
the
icedup
canal
his
life
had
gone
on
as
usual
he
had
known
that
whatever
it
had
been
had
come
very
close
to
getting
him
but
his
life
had
gone
on
he
had
attended
school
taken
an
arithmetic
test
visited
the
library
when
school
was
over
and
eaten
with
his
usual
heartiness
he
had
simply
incorporated
the
thing
he
had
seen
on
the
canal
into
his
life
and
if
he
had
almost
been
killed
by
it
well
kids
were
always
almost
getting
killed
they
dashed
across
streets
without
looking
they
got
horsing
around
in
the
lake
and
suddenly
realized
they
had
floated
far
past
their
depth
on
their
rubber
rafts
and
had
to
paddle
back
they
fell
off
monkeybars
on
their
asses
and
out
of
trees
on
their
heads
now
standing
here
in
the
fading
drizzle
in
front
of
a
trustworthy
hardware
store
that
had
been
a
pawnshop
in
frati
brothers
ben
recalled
the
double
windows
always
full
of
pistols
and
rifles
and
straightrazors
and
guitars
hung
up
by
their
necks
like
exotic
animals
ü
occurred
to
him
that
kids
were
better
at
almost
dying
and
they
were
also
better
at
incorporating
the
inexplicable
into
their
lives
they
believed
implicitly
in
the
invisible
world
miracles
both
bright
and
dark
were
to
be
taken
into
consideration
oh
yes
most
certainly
but
they
by
no
means
stopped
the
world
a
sudden
upheaval
of
beauty
or
terror
at
ten
did
not
preclude
an
extra
cheesedog
or
two
for
lunch
at
noon
but
when
you
grew
up
all
that
changed
you
no
longer
lay
awake
in
your
bed
sure
something
was
crouching
in
the
closet
or
scratching
at
the
window
but
when
something
did
happen
something
beyond
rational
explanation
the
circuits
overloaded
the
axons
and
dendrites
got
hot
you
started
to
jitter
and
jive
you
started
to
shake
rattle
and
roll
your
imagination
started
to
hop
and
bop
and
do
the
funky
chicken
all
over
your
nerves
you
couldn't
just
incorporate
what
had
happened
into
your
life
experience
it
didn't
digest
your
mind
kept
coming
back
to
it
pawing
it
lightly
like
a
kitten
with
a
ball
of
string
until
eventually
of
course
you
either
went
crazy
or
got
to
a
place
where
it
was
impossible
for
you
to
function
and
if
that
happens
ben
thought
it
got
me
us
cold
he
started
to
walk
up
kansas
street
not
conscious
of
heading
anyplace
in
particular
and
thought
suddenly
what
did
we
do
with
the
silver
dollar
he
still
couldn't
remember
the
silver
dollar
ben
beverly
saved
your
life
with
it
yours
maybe
all
the
others
and
especially
bill
it
almost
ripped
my
guts
out
before
beverly
did
what
what
did
she
do
and
how
was
it
able
to
work
she
backed
it
off
and
we
all
helped
her
but
how
a
word
came
to
him
suddenly
a
word
that
meant
nothing
at
all
but
which
tightened
his
flesh
chiid
he
looked
down
at
the
sidewalk
and
for
a
moment
saw
the
shape
of
a
turtle
chalked
there
and
the
world
seemed
to
swim
before
his
eyes
he
shut
them
tightly
and
when
he
opened
them
saw
it
was
not
a
turtle
only
a
hopscotch
grid
half
erased
by
the
light
rain
chiid
what
did
that
mean
don't
know
he
said
aloud
and
when
he
looked
around
quickly
to
see
if
anyone
had
heard
him
talking
to
himself
he
saw
that
he
had
turned
off
kansas
street
and
onto
costello
avenue
at
lunch
he
had
told
the
others
that
the
barrens
were
the
only
place
in
derry
where
he
had
felt
happy
as
a
kid
but
that
wasn't
quite
true
was
it
there
had
been
another
place
either
accidentally
or
unconsciously
he
had
come
to
that
other
place
the
derry
public
library
he
stood
in
front
of
it
for
a
minute
or
two
hands
still
in
his
pockets
it
hadn't
changed
he
admired
its
lines
as
much
now
as
he
had
as
a
child
like
so
many
stone
buildings
that
had
been
welldesigned
it
succeeded
in
confounding
the
closely
observing
eye
with
contradictions
its
stone
solidity
was
somehow
balanced
by
the
delicacy
of
its
arches
and
slim
columns
it
looked
both
banksafe
squat
and
yet
slim
and
clean
well
it
was
slim
as
city
buildings
went
especially
those
erected
around
the
turn
of
the
century
and
the
windows
crisscrossed
with
narrow
strips
of
iron
were
graceful
and
rounded
these
contradictions
saved
it
from
ugliness
and
he
was
not
entirely
surprised
to
feel
a
wave
of
love
for
the
place
nothing
much
had
changed
on
qstello
avenue
glancing
along
it
he
could
see
the
derry
community
house
and
he
found
himself
wondering
if
the
costello
avenue
market
was
still
there
at
the
point
where
the
avenue
which
was
semicircular
rejoined
kansas
street
he
walked
across
the
library
lawn
barely
noticing
that
his
dress
boots
were
getting
wet
to
have
a
look
at
that
glassedin
passageway
between
the
grownups
library
and
the
children
library
it
was
also
unchanged
and
from
here
standing
just
outside
the
bowed
branches
of
a
weeping
willow
tree
he
could
see
people
passing
back
and
forth
the
old
delight
flooded
him
and
he
really
forgot
what
had
happened
at
the
end
of
the
reunion
lunch
for
the
first
time
he
could
remember
walking
around
to
this
very
same
spot
as
a
kid
only
in
the
winter
plowing
his
way
through
snow
that
was
almost
hipdeep
and
then
standing
for
as
long
as
fifteen
minutes
he
would
come
at
dusk
he
remembered
and
again
it
was
the
contrasts
that
drew
him
and
held
him
there
with
the
tips
of
his
fingers
going
numb
and
snow
melting
inside
his
green
gumrubber
boots
it
would
be
drawingdowndark
out
where
he
was
the
world
going
purple
with
early
winter
shadows
the
sky
the
color
of
ashes
in
the
east
and
embers
in
the
west
it
would
be
cold
where
he
was
ten
degrees
perhaps
and
chillier
than
that
if
the
wind
was
blowing
across
from
the
frozen
barrens
as
it
so
often
did
but
there
less
than
forty
yards
from
where
he
stood
people
walked
back
and
forth
in
their
shirtsleeves
there
less
than
forty
yards
from
where
he
stood
was
a
tubeway
of
bright
white
light
thrown
by
the
overhead
fluorescents
little
kids
giggled
together
highschool
sweethearts
held
hands
and
if
the
librarian
saw
them
she
would
make
them
stop
it
was
somehow
magical
magical
in
a
good
way
that
he
had
been
too
young
to
account
for
with
such
mundane
things
as
electric
power
and
oil
heat
the
magic
was
that
glowing
cylinder
of
light
and
life
connecting
those
two
dark
buildings
like
a
lifeline
the
magic
was
in
watching
people
walk
through
it
across
the
dark
snowfield
untouched
by
either
the
dark
or
the
cold
it
made
them
lovely
and
godlike
eventually
he
would
walk
away
as
he
was
doing
now
and
circle
the
building
to
the
front
door
as
he
was
doing
now
but
he
would
always
pause
and
look
back
once
as
he
was
doing
now
before
the
bulking
stone
shoulder
of
the
adult
library
cut
off
the
sightline
to
that
delicate
umbilicus
ruefully
amused
at
the
ache
of
nostalgia
around
his
heart
ben
went
up
the
steps
to
the
door
of
the
adult
library
paused
for
a
moment
on
the
narrow
verandah
just
inside
the
pillars
always
so
high
and
cool
no
matter
how
hot
the
day
then
he
pulled
open
the
ironbound
door
with
the
book
drop
slot
in
it
and
went
into
the
quiet
the
force
of
memory
almost
dizzied
him
for
a
moment
as
he
stepped
into
the
mild
light
of
the
hanging
glass
globes
the
force
was
not
physical
not
like
a
shot
to
the
jaw
or
a
slap
it
was
more
akin
to
that
queer
feeling
of
time
doubling
back
on
itself
that
people
call
for
want
of
a
better
term
déjà
vu
ben
had
had
the
feeling
before
but
it
had
never
struck
him
with
such
disorienting
power
for
the
moment
or
two
he
stood
inside
the
door
he
felt
literally
lost
in
time
not
really
sure
how
old
he
was
was
he
thirtyeight
or
eleven
here
was
the
same
murmuring
quiet
broken
only
by
an
occasional
whisper
the
faint
thud
of
a
librarian
stamping
books
or
overdue
notices
the
hushed
riffle
of
newspaper
or
magazine
pages
being
turned
he
loved
the
quality
of
the
light
as
much
now
as
then
it
slanted
through
the
high
windows
gray
as
a
pigeon
wing
on
this
rainy
afternoon
a
light
that
was
somehow
somnolent
and
dozey
he
walked
across
the
wide
floor
with
its
redandblack
linoleum
pattern
almost
completely
worn
away
trying
as
he
had
dways
tried
back
then
to
hush
the
sound
of
his
footfalls
the
adult
library
rose
up
to
a
dome
in
the
middle
and
all
sounds
were
magnified
he
saw
that
the
circular
iron
staircases
leading
to
the
stacks
were
still
there
one
on
either
side
of
the
horseshoeshaped
main
desk
but
he
also
saw
that
a
tiny
cagework
elevator
had
been
added
at
some
point
in
the
twentyfive
years
since
he
and
his
mamma
had
moved
away
it
was
something
of
a
relief
it
drove
a
wedge
into
that
suffocating
feeling
of
dejavu
he
felt
like
an
interloper
crossing
the
wide
floor
a
spy
from
another
country
he
kept
expecting
the
librarian
at
the
desk
to
raise
her
head
look
at
him
and
then
challenge
him
in
clear
ringing
tones
that
would
shatter
the
concentration
of
every
reader
here
and
focus
every
eye
upon
him
you
yes
you
what
are
you
doing
here
you
have
no
business
here
you're
from
outside
you're
from
before
go
back
where
you
came
from
go
back
right
now
before
i
call
the
police
she
did
look
up
a
young
girl
pretty
and
for
one
absurd
moment
it
seemed
to
ben
that
the
fantasy
was
really
going
to
come
true
and
hi
heart
rose
into
his
throat
as
her
paleblue
eyes
touched
his
then
they
passed
on
indifferently
and
ben
found
he
could
walk
again
if
he
was
a
spy
he
hadn't
been
found
out
he
passed
under
the
coil
of
one
of
the
narrow
and
almost
suicidally
steep
wroughtiron
staircases
on
his
way
to
the
corridor
leading
to
the
children
library
and
was
amused
to
realize
only
after
he
had
done
it
that
he
had
run
down
another
old
track
of
his
childhood
behavior
he
had
looked
up
hoping
as
he
had
hoped
as
a
kid
to
see
a
girl
in
a
skirt
coming
down
those
steps
he
could
remember
now
he
could
remember
glancing
up
there
for
no
reason
at
all
one
day
when
he
was
eight
or
nine
and
looking
right
up
the
chino
skirt
of
a
pretty
highschool
girl
and
seeing
her
clean
pink
underwear
as
the
sudden
sunlit
glint
of
beverly
marsh
ankle
bracelet
had
shot
an
arrow
of
something
more
primitive
than
simple
love
or
affection
through
his
heart
on
the
last
day
of
school
in
so
had
the
sight
of
the
highschool
girl
panties
affected
him
he
could
remember
sitting
at
a
table
in
the
children
library
and
thinking
of
that
unexpected
view
for
perhaps
as
long
as
twenty
minutes
his
cheeks
and
forehead
hot
a
book
about
the
history
of
trains
open
and
unread
before
him
his
penis
a
hard
little
branch
in
his
pants
a
branch
that
had
sunk
its
roots
all
the
way
up
into
his
belly
he
had
fantasized
the
two
of
them
married
living
in
a
small
house
on
the
outskirts
of
town
indulging
in
pleasures
he
did
not
in
the
least
understand
the
feelings
had
passed
off
almost
as
suddenly
as
they
had
come
but
he
had
never
walked
under
the
stairway
again
without
glancing
up
he
hadn't
ever
seen
anything
else
as
interesting
or
affecting
once
a
fat
lady
working
her
way
down
with
ponderous
care
but
he
had
looked
away
from
that
sight
hastily
feeling
ashamed
like
a
violator
but
the
habit
persisted
he
had
done
it
again
now
as
a
grown
man
he
walked
slowly
down
the
glassedin
passageway
noticing
other
changes
now
yellow
decals
that
said
opec
loves
it
when
you
waste
energy
so
save
a
watt
had
been
plastered
over
the
switchplates
the
framed
pictures
on
the
far
wall
when
he
entered
this
scaleddown
world
of
blondewood
tables
and
small
blondewood
chairs
this
world
where
the
drinking
fountain
was
only
four
feet
high
were
not
of
dwight
eisenhower
and
richard
nixon
but
of
ronald
reagan
and
george
bush
reagan
ben
recalled
had
been
host
of
ge
theater
in
the
year
that
ben
had
graduated
from
the
fifth
grade
and
george
bush
would
not
have
seen
thirty
yet
but
that
feeling
of
déjà
vu
swept
him
again
he
was
helpless
before
it
and
this
time
he
felt
the
numb
horror
of
a
man
who
finally
realizes
after
half
an
hour
of
helpless
splashing
that
the
shore
is
growing
no
closer
and
he
is
drowning
it
was
story
hour
and
over
in
the
corner
a
group
of
roughly
a
dozen
little
ones
sat
solemnly
on
their
tiny
chairs
in
a
semicircle
listening
who
is
that
triptrapping
upon
my
bridge
the
librarian
said
in
the
low
growling
tones
of
the
troll
in
the
story
and
ben
thought
when
she
raises
her
head
i'll
see
that
it
miss
dames
yes
it'll
be
miss
davies
and
she
won't
look
a
day
older
but
when
she
did
raise
her
head
he
saw
a
much
younger
woman
than
miss
davies
had
been
even
then
some
of
the
children
covered
their
mouths
and
giggled
but
others
only
watched
her
their
eyes
reflecting
the
eternal
fascination
of
the
fairy
story
would
the
monster
be
bested
or
would
it
feed
tt
is
i
billy
goat
gruff
triptrapping
on
your
bridge
the
librarian
went
on
and
ben
pale
walked
past
her
how
can
it
be
the
same
story
the
very
same
story
am
i
supposed
to
believe
that
just
coincidence
because
i
don't
goddammit
i
just
don't
he
bent
to
the
drinking
fountain
bending
so
far
he
felt
like
richie
doing
one
of
his
salami
salami
baloney
routines
i
ought
to
talk
to
someone
he
thought
panicked
mike
bill
someone
is
something
really
stapling
the
past
and
present
together
here
or
am
i
only
imagining
it
because
if
i'm
not
i'm
not
sure
i
bargained
for
this
much
i
he
looked
at
the
checkout
desk
and
his
heart
seemed
to
stop
in
his
chest
for
a
moment
before
beginning
to
race
doubletime
the
poster
was
simple
stark
and
familiar
it
said
simply
remember
the
curfew
p.m
derry
police
department
in
that
instant
it
all
seemed
to
come
clear
to
him
it
came
in
a
grisly
flash
of
light
and
he
realized
that
the
vote
they
had
taken
was
a
joke
there
was
no
turning
back
never
had
been
they
were
on
a
track
as
preordained
as
the
memorytrack
which
had
caused
him
to
look
up
when
he
passed
under
the
stairway
leading
to
the
stacks
there
was
an
eho
here
in
derry
a
deadly
echo
and
all
they
could
hope
for
was
that
the
echo
could
be
changed
enough
in
their
favor
to
allow
them
to
escape
with
their
lives
christ
he
muttered
and
scrubbed
a
palm
up
one
cheek
hard
can
i
help
you
sir
a
voice
at
his
elbow
asked
and
he
jumped
a
little
it
was
a
girl
of
perhaps
seventeen
her
darkblonde
hair
held
back
from
her
pretty
highschooler
face
with
barrettes
a
library
assistant
of
course
they'd
had
them
in
too
highschool
girls
and
boys
who
shelved
books
showed
kids
how
to
use
the
card
catalogue
discussed
book
reports
and
school
papers
helped
bewildered
scholars
with
their
footnotes
and
bibliographies
the
pay
was
a
pittance
but
there
were
always
kids
willing
to
do
it
it
was
agreeable
work
on
the
heels
of
this
reading
the
girl
pleasant
but
questioning
look
a
little
more
closely
he
remembered
that
he
no
longer
really
belonged
here
he
was
a
giant
in
the
land
of
little
people
an
intruder
in
the
adult
library
he
had
felt
uneasy
about
the
possibility
of
being
looked
at
or
spoken
to
but
here
it
was
something
of
a
relief
for
one
thing
it
proved
he
was
still
an
adult
and
the
fact
that
the
girl
was
clearly
braless
under
her
thin
western
style
shirt
was
also
more
relief
than
turnon
if
proof
that
this
was
and
not
was
needed
the
clearly
limned
points
of
her
nipples
against
the
cotton
of
her
shirt
was
it
no
thank
you
he
said
and
then
for
no
reason
at
all
that
he
could
understand
he
heard
himself
add
i
was
looking
for
my
son
oh
what
his
name
maybe
i've
seen
him
she
smiled
i
know
most
of
the
kids
his
name
is
ben
hanscom
he
said
but
i
don't
see
him
here
tell
me
what
he
looks
like
and
i'll
give
him
a
message
if
there
is
one
well
ben
said
uncomfortable
now
and
beginning
to
wish
he
had
never
started
this
he
on
the
stout
side
and
he
looks
a
little
bit
like
me
but
it
no
big
deal
miss
if
you
see
him
just
tell
him
his
dad
popped
by
on
his
way
home
will
she
said
and
smiled
but
the
smile
didn't
reach
her
eyes
and
ben
suddenly
realized
that
she
hadn't
come
over
and
spoken
to
him
out
of
simple
politeness
and
a
wish
to
help
she
happened
to
be
a
library
assistant
in
the
children
library
in
a
town
where
nine
children
had
been
slain
over
a
span
of
eight
months
you
see
a
strange
man
in
this
scaleddown
world
where
adults
rarely
come
except
to
drop
their
kids
off
or
pick
them
up
you're
suspicious
of
course
thank
you
he
said
gave
her
a
smile
he
hoped
was
reassuring
and
then
got
the
hell
out
he
walked
back
through
the
corridor
to
the
adult
library
and
went
to
the
desk
on
an
impulse
he
didn't
understand
but
of
course
they
were
supposed
to
follow
their
impulses
this
afternoon
weren't
they
follow
their
impulses
and
see
where
they
led
the
name
plate
on
the
circulation
desk
identified
the
pretty
young
librarian
as
carole
banner
behind
her
ben
could
see
a
door
with
a
frostedglass
panel
lettered
on
this
was
michael
hanlon
head
librarian
may
i
help
yo
ms
banner
asked
i
think
s
ben
said
that
is
i
hope
so
i'd
like
to
get
a
library
card
very
good
she
said
and
took
out
a
form
are
you
a
resident
of
berry
not
presently
home
address
then
rural
star
route
hemingford
home
nebraska
he
paused
for
a
moment
a
little
amused
by
her
stare
and
then
reeled
off
the
zip
code
ts
this
a
joke
mr
hanscom
not
at
all
are
you
moving
to
derry
then
i
have
no
plans
to
no
this
is
a
long
way
to
come
to
borrow
books
isn't
it
don't
they
have
libraries
in
nebraska
its
kind
of
a
sentimental
thing
ben
said
he
would
have
thought
telling
a
stranger
this
would
be
embarrassing
but
he
found
it
wasn't
i
grew
up
in
berry
you
see
this
is
the
first
time
i've
been
back
since
i
was
a
kid
i've
been
walking
around
seeing
what
changed
and
what
hasn't
and
all
at
once
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
spent
about
ten
years
of
my
life
here
between
ages
three
and
thirteen
and
i
don't
have
a
single
thing
to
remember
those
years
by
not
so
much
as
a
postcard
i
had
some
silver
dollars
but
i
lost
one
of
them
and
gave
the
rest
to
a
friend
i
guess
what
i
want
is
a
souvenir
of
my
childhood
it
late
but
don't
they
say
better
late
than
never
carole
banner
smiled
and
the
smile
changed
her
pretty
face
into
one
that
was
beautiful
think
that
very
sweet
she
said
if
you'd
like
to
browse
for
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
i'll
have
the
card
made
up
for
you
when
you
come
back
to
the
desk
ben
grinned
a
little
i
guess
there'll
be
a
fe
he
said
outoftowner
and
all
bid
you
have
a
card
when
you
were
a
boy
sure
did
ben
smiled
except
for
my
friends
i
guess
that
library
card
was
the
most
important
ben
would
you
come
up
here
a
voice
called
suddenly
cutting
across
the
library
hush
like
a
scalpel
he
turned
around
jumping
guiltily
the
way
people
do
when
someone
shouts
in
a
library
he
saw
no
one
he
knew
and
realized
a
noment
later
that
no
one
had
looked
up
or
shown
any
sign
of
surprise
or
annoyance
the
old
men
still
read
their
copies
of
the
berry
news
the
boston
globe
national
geographic
time
newsweek
u.s
news
world
report
at
the
tables
in
the
reference
room
two
highschool
girls
still
had
their
heads
together
over
a
stack
of
papers
and
a
pile
of
filecards
several
browsers
went
on
looking
through
the
books
on
the
shelves
marked
current
fiction
sevendayloan
an
old
man
in
a
ridiculous
driving
cap
a
cold
pipe
clenched
between
his
teeth
went
on
leafing
through
a
folio
of
luis
de
varga
sketches
he
turned
back
to
the
young
woman
who
was
looking
at
him
puzzled
is
anything
wrong
no
ben
said
smiling
i
thought
i
heard
something
i
guess
i'm
more
jetlagged
than
i
thought
what
were
you
saying
well
actually
you
were
saying
but
i
was
about
to
add
that
if
you
had
a
card
when
you
were
a
resident
your
name
will
still
be
in
the
files
she
said
we
keep
everything
on
microfiche
now
some
change
from
when
you
were
a
kid
here
i
guess
ye
he
said
a
lot
of
things
have
changed
in
derry
but
a
lot
of
things
also
seem
to
have
remained
the
same
anyway
i
can
just
look
you
up
and
give
you
a
renewal
card
no
charge
that
great
ben
said
and
before
he
could
add
thanks
the
voice
cut
through
the
library
sacramental
silence
again
louder
now
ominously
jolly
come
on
tip
ben
come
on
up

fat
little
fuck

is
your
life
ben
hanscom

little
he

right
away
she
said
thank
you
she
headed
for
the
old
royal
typewriter
at
the
corner
of
her
desk
ben
walked
slowly
away
his
heart
a
thudding
drum
in
his
chest
yes
he
was
sweating
he
could
feel
it
trickling
down
from
his
forehead
his
armpits
matting
the
hair
on
his
chest
he
looked
up
and
saw
pennywise
the
clown
standing
at
the
top
of
the
lefthand
staircase
looking
down
at
him
his
face
was
white
with
greasepaint
his
mouth
bled
lipstick
in
a
killers
grin
there
were
empty
sockets
where
his
eyes
should
have
been
he
held
a
bunch
of
balloons
in
one
hand
and
a
book
in
the
other
not
he
ben
thought
it
i
am
standing
here
in
the
middle
of
the
derry
public
library
rotunda
on
a
latespring
afternoon

iam

up
ben
opened
his
mouth
to
call

you're
insane
if
you
think
i'm
going
up
there
and
suddenly
realized
that
if
he
did
that
everyone
here

be
looking
at
him
everyone
here
would
be
thinking
who
is
that
crazyman

then

the
clown
on
the
landing
threw
its
head
back
and
shrieked
laughter
it
roared
and
echoed
in
the
dome
of
the
rotunda
like
a
flight
of
black
bats
and
ben
was
only
able
to
keep
from
clapping
his
hands
over
his
ears
with
a
tremendous
effort
of
will
come
on
up
ben
pennywise
called
down
we'll
talk
neutral
ground
what

thought
when

i
think
we're
going
to
kill
you
the
clown
shrieked
laughter
again
kill
me
kill
me
and
suddenly
horribly
the
voice
was
richie
tozier
voice
not
his
voice
precisely
but
richie

black
boy

then
that
shrieking
laughter
again
trembling
whitefaced
ben
walked
across
the
echoing
center
of
the
adults
library
he
felt
that
soon
he
would
vomit
he
stood
in
front
of
a
shelf
of
books
and
took
one
down
at
random
with
a
hand
that
trembled
badly
his
cold
fingers
flittered
the
pages
this
is
your
one
chance

the
voice
called
from
behind
ad
above
him

he
turned
slowly
still
holding
the
book
in
his
icy
hands
he
didn't
want
to
look
but
it
were
as
if
there
were
an
invisible
hand
under
his
chin
tilting
his
head
up
and
up
and
up
the
clown
was
gone
dracula
was
standing
at
the
top
of
the
lefthand
stairway
but
it
was
no
movie
dracula
it
was
not
bela
lugosi
or
christopher
lee
or
frank
langella
or
francis
lederer
or
reggie
nalder
an
ancient
man
thing
with
a
face
like
a
twisted
root
stood
there
its
face
was
deadly
pale
its
eyes
purplishred
the
color
of
bloodclots
its
mouth
dropped
open
revealing
a
mouthful
of
gillette
blueblades
that
had
been
set
in
the
gums
at
angles
it
was
like
looking
into
a
deadly
mirrormaze
where
a
single
misstep
could
get
you
cut
in
half
keeerunc
it
screamed
and
its
jaws
snapped
closed
blood
gouted
from
its
mouth
in
a
redblack
flood
chunks
of
its
severed
lips
fell
to
the
glowing
white
silk
of
its
formal
shirt
and
slid
down
its
front
leaving
snail
trails
of
blood
behind
what
did
stan
uris
see
before
he
die
the
vampire
on
the
landing
screamed
down
at
him
laughing
through
the
bloody
hole
of
its
mouth
was
it
prince
albert
in
a
can
was
it
davy
crockett
king
of
the
wild
frontier
what
did
he
see
ben
do
you
want
to
see
it
too
what
did
he
see
what
did
he
se
then
that
shrieking
laughter
again
and
ben
knew
that
he
would
scream
now
himself
yes
there
was
no
way
to
stop
the
scream
it
was
going
to
come
blood
was
pattering
down
from
the
landing
in
a
grisly
shower
one
drop
had
landed
on
the
arthritisbunched
hand
of
an
old
man
who
was
reading
the
wall
street
journal
it
was
running
down
between
his
knuckles
unseen
and
unfelt
ben
hitched
in
breath
sure
the
scream
would
follow
unthinkable
in
the
quiet
of
this
softly
drizzling
spring
afternoon
as
shocking
as
the
slash
of
a
knife
or
a
mouthful
of
razor
blades
instead
what
came
out
in
a
shaky
uneven
rush
spoken
instead
of
screamed
spoken
low
like
a
prayer
were
these
words
we
made
slugs
out
of
it
of
course
we
made
the
silver
dollar
into
silver
slugs
the
gentleman
in
the
drivingcap
who
had
been
perusing
the
de
vargas
sketches
looked
up
sharply
nonsense
he
said
now
people
did
look
up
someone
hissed
shhh
at
the
old
man
in
an
annoyed
voice
tm
sorry
ben
said
in
a
low
trembling
voice
he
was
faintly
aware
that
his
face
was
now
running
with
sweat
and
that
his
shirt
was
plastered
to
his
body
i
was
thinking
aloud
nonsense
the
old
gentleman
repeated
in
a
louder
voice
can't
make
slver
bullets
from
silver
dollars
common
misconception
pulp
fiction
problem
is
with
specific
gravity
suddenly
the
woman
ms
danner
was
there
mr
brockhill
you'll
have
to
be
quiet
she
said
kindly
enough
people
are
reading
man
sick
brockhill
said
abruptly
and
went
back
to
his
book
give
him
an
aspirin
carole
carole
danner
looked
at
ben
and
her
face
sharpened
with
concern
are
you
ill
mr
hanscom
i
know
it
terribly
impolite
to
say
so
but
you
look
terrible
ben
said
i
i
had
chinese
food
for
lunch
i
don't
think
it
agreed
with
me
if
you
want
to
lie
down
there
a
cot
in
mr
hanlon
office
you
could
no
thanks
but
no
what
he
wanted
was
not
to
lie
down
but
to
get
the
hell
out
of
the
derry
public
library
he
looked
up
at
the
landing
the
clown
was
gone
the
vampire
was
gone
but
tied
to
the
low
wroughtiron
railing
which
surrounded
the
landing
was
a
balloon
written
on
its
bulging
skin
were
the
words
have
a
good
day
tonight
you
die
tve
got
your
library
card
she
said
putting
a
tentative
hand
on
his
arm
do
you
still
want
it
yes
thanks
ben
said
he
drew
a
deep
shuddery
breath
i'm
very
sorry
about
this
i
just
hope
it
isn't
food
poisoning
she
said
wouldn't
work
mr
brockhill
said
without
looking
up
from
de
vargas
or
removing
his
dead
pipe
from
the
corner
of
his
mouth
device
of
pulp
fiction
bullet
would
tumble
and
speaking
again
with
no
foreknowledge
that
he
was
going
to
speak
ben
said
slugs
not
bullets
we
realized
almost
right
away
that
we
couldn't
make
bullets
i
mean
we
were
just
kids
it
was
my
idea
to
shhh
someone
said
again
brockhill
gave
ben
a
slightly
startled
look
seemed
about
to
speak
then
went
back
to
the
sketches
at
the
desk
carole
danner
handed
him
a
small
orange
card
with
derry
public
library
stamped
across
the
top
bemused
ben
realized
it
was
the
first
adult
librarycard
he
had
owned
in
his
whole
life
the
one
he'd
had
as
a
kid
had
been
canary
yellow
are
you
sure
you
don't
want
to
lie
down
mr
hanscom
tm
feeling
a
little
better
thanks
sure
he
managed
a
smile
t'm
sure
you
do
look
a
little
better
she
said
but
she
said
it
doubtfully
as
if
understanding
that
this
was
the
proper
thing
to
say
but
not
really
believing
it
then
she
was
holding
a
book
under
the
microfilm
gadget
they
used
these
days
to
record
bookloans
and
ben
felt
a
touch
of
almost
hysterical
amusement
it
the
book
i
grabbed
off
the
shelf
when
the
clown
started
to
do
its
pickaninny
voice
he
thought
she
thought
i
wanted
to
borrow
it
i've
made
my
first
withdrawal
from
the
demy
public
library
in
twentyfive
years
and
i
don't
even
know
what
the
book
is
furthermore
i
don't
care
just
let
me
out
of
here
okay
that'll
be
enough
thank
you
he
said
putting
the
book
under
his
arm
you're
more
than
welcome
mr
hanscom
are
you
sure
you
wouldn't
like
an
aspirin
quite
sure
he
said
and
then
hesitated
you
wouldn't
by
any
chance
know
what
happened
to
mrs
starrett
would
you
barbara
starrett
she
used
to
be
the
head
of
the
children
library
she
died
carole
danner
said
three
years
ago
it
was
a
stroke
i
understand
it
was
a
great
shame
she
was
relatively
young
fiftyeight
or
nine
i
think
mr
hanlon
closed
the
library
for
the
day
oh
ben
said
and
felt
a
hollow
place
open
in
his
heart
that
what
happened
when
you
got
back
to
your
usedtobe
as
the
song
put
it
the
frosting
on
the
cake
was
sweet
but
the
stuff
underneath
was
bitter
people
forgot
you
or
died
on
you
or
lost
their
hair
and
teeth
in
some
cases
you
found
that
they
had
lost
their
minds
oh
it
was
great
to
be
alive
boy
howdy
t'm
sorry
she
said
you
liked
her
didn't
you
all
the
kids
liked
mrs
starrett
ben
said
and
was
alarmed
to
realize
that
tears
were
now
very
close
are
you
if
she
asks
me
if
i'm
all
right
one
more
time
i
really
am
going
to
cry
i
think
or
scream
or
something
he
glanced
at
his
watch
and
said
really
have
to
run
thanks
for
being
so
nice
have
a
nice
day
mr
hanscom
sure
because
tonight
i
die
he
tipped
a
finger
her
way
and
started
back
across
the
floor
mr
brockhill
glanced
up
at
him
once
sharply
and
suspiciously
he
looked
up
at
the
landing
which
topped
the
lefthand
staircase
the
balloon
still
floated
there
tied
by
its
string
to
lacy
wroughtiron
but
now
the
printing
on
its
side
read
i
killed
barbara
starrett
pennywise
the
clown
he
looked
away
feeling
the
pulse
in
his
throat
starting
to
run
again
he
let
himself
out
and
was
startled
by
sunlight
the
clouds
overhead
were
coming
unravelled
and
a
warm
late
may
sun
was
shafting
down
making
the
grass
look
impossibly
green
and
lush
ben
felt
something
start
to
lift
from
his
heart
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
left
some
insupportable
burden
behind
in
the
library
and
then
he
looked
down
at
the
book
he
had
inadvertently
withdrawn
and
his
teeth
clamped
together
with
sudden
painful
force
it
was
bulldozer
by
stephen
w
meader
one
of
the
books
he
had
withdrawn
from
the
library
on
the
day
he
had
dived
into
the
barrens
to
get
away
from
henry
bowers
and
his
friends
and
speaking
of
henry
the
track
of
his
engineer
boot
was
still
on
the
book
cover
shaking
fumbling
at
the
pages
he
turned
to
the
back
the
library
had
gone
over
to
a
microfilm
checkout
system
he
had
seen
that
bat
there
was
still
a
pocket
in
the
back
of
this
book
with
a
card
tucked
into
it
there
was
a
name
written
on
each
line
of
the
card
followed
by
the
librarian
return
date
stamp
looking
at
the
card
ben
saw
this
name
of
borrower
return
by
stamped
date
charles
n
brown
may
david
hartwell
jun
joseph
brennan
jun
and
on
the
last
line
of
the
card
his
own
childish
signature
written
in
heavy
pencil
strokes
benjamin
hanscom
juni
stamped
across
this
card
stamped
across
the
book
flyleaf
stamped
across
the
thickness
of
the
pages
stamped
again
and
again
in
smeary
red
ink
that
looked
like
blood
was
one
word
cancel
oh
dear
god
ben
murmured
he
did
not
know
what
else
to
say
that
seemed
to
cover
the
entire
situation
oh
dear
god
dear
god
he
stood
in
the
new
sunlight
suddenly
wondering
what
was
happening
to
the
others
eddie
kaspbrak
makes
a
catch
eddie
got
off
the
bus
at
the
corner
of
kansas
street
and
kossuth
lane
kossuth
was
a
street
that
ran
a
quarter
of
a
mile
downhill
before
deadending
abruptly
where
the
crumbling
earth
sloped
into
the
barrens
he
had
absolutely
no
idea
why
he
had
chosen
this
place
to
leave
the
bus
kossuth
lane
meant
nothing
to
him
and
he
had
known
no
one
on
this
particular
section
of
kansas
street
but
it
seemed
like
the
right
place
that
was
all
he
knew
but
at
this
point
it
seemed
to
be
enough
beverly
had
climbed
off
the
bus
with
a
little
wave
at
one
of
the
lower
main
street
stops
mike
had
taken
his
car
back
to
the
library
now
watching
the
small
and
somehow
absurd
mercedes
bus
pull
away
he
wondered
exactly
what
he
was
doing
here
standing
on
an
obscure
streetcorner
in
an
obscure
town
nearly
five
hundred
miles
away
from
myra
who
was
undoubtedly
worried
to
tears
about
him
he
felt
an
instant
of
almost
painful
vertigo
touched
his
jacket
pocket
and
remembered
that
he
had
left
his
dramamine
back
at
the
town
house
along
with
the
rest
of
his
pharmacopeia
he
had
aspirin
though
he
would
no
more
have
gone
out
sans
aspirin
than
he
would
have
gone
out
sans
pants
he
chugged
a
couple
dry
and
began
to
walk
along
kansas
street
thinking
vaguely
that
he
might
go
to
the
public
library
or
perhaps
cross
over
to
costello
avenue
it
was
beginning
to
clear
now
and
he
supposed
he
could
even
walk
across
to
west
broadway
and
admire
the
old
victorian
houses
that
stood
there
along
the
only
two
really
handsome
residential
blocks
in
derry
he
used
to
do
that
sometimes
when
he
was
a
kid
just
walk
along
west
broadway
sort
of
casual
like
he
was
on
his
way
to
somewhere
else
there
was
the
mueller
near
the
corner
of
witcham
and
west
broadway
a
red
house
with
turrets
on
either
side
and
hedges
in
front
the
muellers
had
a
gardener
who
always
looked
at
eddie
with
suspicious
eyes
until
he
had
passed
on
his
way
then
there
was
the
bowie
house
which
was
four
down
from
the
mueller
on
the
same
side
one
of
the
reasons
he
supposed
that
greta
bowie
and
sally
mueller
had
been
such
great
friends
in
grammar
school
it
was
green
shingled
and
also
had
turrets
but
while
the
turrets
on
the
mueller
house
were
squared
off
those
on
the
bowie
house
were
capped
with
funny
coneshaped
things
that
looked
to
eddie
like
squatty
duncecaps
in
the
summer
there
was
always
lawnfurniture
on
the
side
lawn
a
table
with
a
sporty
yellow
umbrella
over
it
wicker
chairs
a
rope
hammock
stretched
between
two
trees
there
was
always
a
croquet
game
set
up
out
back
too
eddie
knew
this
although
he
had
never
been
invited
over
to
greta
house
to
play
croquet
walking
by
casually
like
he
was
on
his
way
to
somewhere
else
eddie
would
sometimes
hear
the
click
of
the
balls
laughter
groans
as
someone
ball
was
sent
away
once
he
had
seen
greta
herself
a
lemonade
in
one
hand
and
her
croquet
mallet
in
the
other
looking
slim
and
pretty
beyond
the
words
of
all
the
poets
even
her
sunburned
shoulders
seemed
wonderfully
pretty
to
eddie
kaspbrak
who
had
at
that
time
been
nine
going
after
her
ball
which
had
been
sent
away
it
had
ricocheted
off
a
tree
and
had
thus
brought
greta
into
eddie
view
he
fell
in
love
with
her
a
little
that
day
her
shining
blonde
har
falling
to
the
shoulders
of
her
culotte
dress
which
was
a
cool
blue
she
glanced
around
and
for
a
moment
he
thought
she
had
seen
him
but
that
proved
not
to
be
so
because
when
he
raised
his
hand
in
a
timid
hello
she
did
not
raise
hers
in
return
but
only
whacked
her
ball
back
onto
the
rear
lawn
and
then
ran
after
it
he
had
walked
on
with
no
resentment
at
the
unreturned
hello
he
genuinely
believed
she
must
not
have
see
him
or
at
the
fact
that
he
had
never
been
invited
to
attend
one
of
the
saturdayafternoon
croquet
games
why
would
a
beautiful
girl
like
greta
bowie
want
to
invite
a
kid
like
him
he
was
thinchested
asthmatic
and
had
the
face
of
a
drowned
water
rat
yeah
he
thought
walking
aimlessly
back
down
kansas
street
j
should
have
gone
over
to
west
broadway
and
looked
at
all
those
houses
again
the
muellers
the
bowie
dr
hole
place
the
tracker
his
thoughts
broke
off
abruptly
at
that
last
name
because
speak
of
the
devil
here
he
was
standing
in
front
of
tracker
brother
truck
depot
still
right
here
eddie
said
aloud
and
laughed
son
of
a
gu
the
house
on
west
broadway
which
belonged
to
phil
and
tony
tracker
a
pair
of
lifelong
bachelors
was
probably
the
loveliest
of
the
large
houses
on
that
street
a
spotlessly
white
mid
victorian
with
green
lawns
and
great
beds
of
flowers
that
rioted
in
a
neatly
landscaped
way
of
course
all
the
spring
and
summer
long
their
driveway
was
freshly
sealed
each
fall
so
that
it
always
remained
as
black
as
a
dark
mirror
the
slate
shingles
on
the
many
slants
of
the
roof
were
always
a
perfect
mint
green
that
almost
exactly
matched
the
lawn
and
people
sometimes
stopped
to
take
pictures
of
the
mullioned
windows
which
were
very
old
and
quite
remarkable
any
two
men
who
bother
keeping
a
house
so
nice
must
be
queers
eddie
mother
had
once
said
in
a
disgruntled
sort
of
way
and
eddie
hadn't
dared
ask
for
clarification
the
truck
depot
was
the
exact
opposite
of
the
tracker
house
on
west
broadway
it
was
a
low
brick
structure
the
bricks
were
old
and
crumbling
in
places
their
dirtyorange
hue
shading
to
a
sooty
black
at
the
building
footings
the
windows
were
uniformly
filthy
except
for
a
small
circular
place
on
one
of
the
lower
panes
of
the
starter
office
ths
one
pane
had
been
kept
spotlessly
clean
by
kids
before
eddie
and
those
who
came
after
because
the
starter
kept
a
playboy
calendar
over
his
desk
no
boy
came
to
play
scratch
baseball
in
the
back
lot
without
first
stopping
to
wipe
at
the
glass
with
his
ballglove
and
examine
that
month
pinup
the
depot
was
surrounded
by
a
waste
of
gravel
on
three
sides
longdistance
haulers
jimmypetes
and
kenworths
and
rios
all
painted
with
the
words
tracker
bros
derry
newton
providence
hartford
new
york
sometimes
stood
here
in
tangled
disordered
profusion
sometimes
they
were
put
together
and
sometimes
there
were
just
cabs
or
body
boxes
standing
silent
on
their
rear
wheels
and
support
struts
the
brothers
kept
their
trucks
out
of
the
lot
at
the
back
of
the
building
as
much
as
they
could
because
they
were
both
avid
baseball
fans
and
liked
the
kids
to
come
and
play
phil
tracker
drove
freight
himself
so
the
boys
rarely
saw
him
but
tony
tracker
a
man
with
huge
slab
arms
and
a
gut
to
match
kept
the
books
and
the
accounts
and
eddie
who
never
played
his
mother
would
have
killed
him
if
she
had
heard
he
was
playing
baseball
racing
around
and
getting
dust
in
his
delicate
lungs
risking
broken
legs
concussions
and
god
alone
knew
what
else
got
used
to
seeing
him
he
was
a
summer
fixture
his
voice
as
much
a
part
of
the
game
to
eddie
then
as
mel
alien
later
became
tony
tracker
large
but
somehow
ghostlike
his
white
shirt
glimmering
as
summer
dusk
drew
down
and
fireflies
began
to
loom
the
air
with
their
lace
of
lights
yelling
you
got
to
get
under
that
bawl
before
you
can
catch
it
red
you
took
your
eye
off
n
the
bawl
halfpint
you
can't
hit
the
goddam
thing
if
you
ain't
looking
at
it
slide
horsefoot
you
get
the
soles
of
them
keds
in
that
secondbaseman
face
he
ain'tnever
goan
tag
you
out
never
called
any
of
them
by
name
eddie
remembered
it
was
always
hey
red
hey
blondie
hey
foureyes
hey
halfpint
it
was
never
a
ball
it
was
always
a
bawl
it
was
never
a
bat
it
was
always
something
tony
tracker
called
an
ashhandle
as
in
you
ain't
never
goan
hit
that
bawl
if
you
don't
choke
up
on
the
ashhandle
horsefoot
grinning
eddie
walked
a
little
closer
and
then
the
grin
faded
the
long
brick
building
where
orders
had
been
processed
trucks
repaired
and
goods
stored
on
a
shortterm
basis
was
now
dark
and
silent
weeds
were
growing
up
through
the
gravel
and
there
were
no
trucks
in
either
side
yard
only
a
single
box
its
sides
rusty
and
dull
getting
closer
still
he
saw
that
there
was
a
realtor
for
salesign
in
the
window
tracker
out
of
business
he
thought
and
was
surprised
at
the
sadness
the
thought
carried
with
it
as
if
someone
had
died
he
was
glad
now
he
hadn't
walked
over
to
west
broadway
if
tracker
brothers
could
have
gone
under
tracker
brothers
which
had
seemed
eternal
what
might
have
happened
on
that
street
he
had
liked
so
much
to
walk
down
as
a
kid
he
realized
uneasily
that
he
didn't
want
to
know
he
didn't
want
to
see
greta
bowie
with
gray
in
her
hair
her
hips
and
legs
thickened
with
much
sitting
and
much
eating
and
much
drinking
it
was
better
safer
to
just
stay
away
that
what
we
all
should
have
done
just
stayed
away
we've
got
no
business
here
coming
back
to
where
you
grew
up
is
like
doing
some
crazy
yoga
trick
putting
your
feet
in
your
own
mouth
and
somehow
swallowing
yourself
so
there
nothing
left
it
can't
be
done
and
any
sane
person
ought
to
be
fucking
glad
it
can't
what
do
you
suppose
happened
to
tony
and
phil
tracker
anyway
a
heart
attack
for
tony
perhaps
he
had
been
carrying
maybe
seventyfive
extra
pounds
of
meat
on
his
bones
you
had
to
watch
out
for
what
your
heart
might
be
up
to
the
poets
might
romance
about
broken
hearts
and
barry
manilow
sing
about
them
and
that
was
fine
by
eddie
he
and
myra
had
every
album
barry
manilow
had
ever
recorded
but
he
himself
preferred
a
good
solid
ekg
every
year
sure
tony
heart
had
probably
given
it
up
as
a
bad
job
and
phil
bad
luck
on
the
highway
maybe
eddie
who
made
his
living
behind
the
wheel
himself
or
had
these
days
he
only
drove
the
celebs
and
spent
the
rest
of
his
tune
driving
a
desk
knew
about
bad
luck
on
the
highway
old
phil
might
have
jackknifed
a
rig
somewhere
in
new
hampshire
or
in
the
hainesville
woods
up
north
in
maine
when
the
going
was
icy
or
maybe
he
had
lost
his
brakes
on
some
long
hill
south
of
derry
heading
into
haven
in
a
driving
springtime
rain
those
things
or
any
of
the
others
you
heard
in
those
shitkicking
country
songs
about
truckdrivers
who
wore
stetson
hats
and
had
cheating
on
their
minds
driving
a
desk
was
sometimes
lonely
but
eddie
had
been
in
the
driver
seat
himself
more
than
once
his
aspirator
riding
there
with
him
on
the
dashboard
its
trigger
reflected
ghostly
in
the
windshield
and
a
bucketload
of
pills
in
the
glove
compartment
and
he
knew
that
real
loneliness
was
a
smeary
red
the
color
of
the
taillights
of
the
car
ahead
of
you
reflected
on
wet
hottop
in
a
driving
rain
oh
shit
the
time
goes
by
eddie
kaspbrak
said
in
a
sighing
sort
of
whisper
and
was
not
even
aware
that
he
had
spoken
aloud
feeling
both
mellow
and
unhappy
a
state
more
common
to
him
than
he
ever
would
have
believed
eddie
skirted
the
building
gucci
loafers
crunching
in
the
gravel
to
look
at
the
lot
where
the
baseball
games
had
been
played
when
he
was
a
kid
when
it
seemed
ninety
percent
of
the
world
had
been
made
up
of
kids
the
lot
wasn't
much
changed
but
a
look
was
enough
to
convince
him
beyond
doubt
that
the
games
had
stopped
a
tradition
that
had
simply
died
out
at
some
point
in
the
years
between
for
reasons
of
its
own
in
the
diamond
shape
of
the
infield
had
been
defined
not
by
limed
basepaths
but
in
ruts
made
by
running
feet
they
had
no
actual
bases
those
boys
who
had
played
baseball
here
boys
who
were
all
older
than
the
losers
although
eddie
remembered
now
that
stan
uris
had
sometimes
played
his
batting
was
only
fair
but
in
the
outfield
he
could
run
fast
and
he
had
the
reflexes
of
an
angel
but
four
pieces
of
dirty
canvas
were
always
kept
under
the
loadingbay
behind
the
long
brick
building
to
be
ceremonially
taken
out
when
enough
kids
had
drifted
into
the
back
lot
to
play
ball
and
just
as
ceremonially
returned
when
the
shades
of
evening
had
fallen
thickly
enough
to
end
further
play
standing
here
now
eddie
could
see
no
trace
of
those
rutted
basepaths
weeds
had
grown
up
through
the
gravel
in
patchy
profusion
broken
soda
and
beer
bottles
twinkled
here
and
there
in
the
old
days
such
shards
of
broken
glass
had
been
religiously
removed
the
only
thing
that
was
the
same
was
the
chainlink
fence
at
the
back
of
the
lot
twelve
feet
high
and
as
rusty
as
dried
blood
it
framed
the
sky
in
droves
of
diamond
shapes
that
was
homerun
territory
eddie
thought
standing
bemused
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
at
the
place
where
home
plate
had
been
twentyseven
years
ago
over
the
fence
and
down
into
the
barrens
they
used
to
call
it
the
automatic
he
laughed
out
loud
and
then
looked
around
nervously
as
if
it
were
a
ghost
who
had
laughed
out
loud
instead
of
a
guy
in
sixtydollar
slacks
a
guy
as
solid
as
well
as
solid
as...as
get
off
it
eds
richie
voice
seemed
to
whisper
you
ain't
solid
at
all
and
in
the
last
few
years
the
chucks
have
been
few
and
far
between
right
yeah
righ
eddie
said
in
a
low
voice
and
kicked
a
few
loose
stones
away
in
a
rattle
in
truth
he
had
only
seen
two
balls
go
over
the
fence
at
the
back
of
the
lot
behind
tracker
brothers
both
of
them
hit
by
the
same
kid
belch
huggins
belch
had
been
almost
comically
big
already
six
feet
tall
at
twelve
weighing
maybe
a
hundred
and
seventy
he
had
gotten
his
nickname
because
he
was
able
to
articulate
belches
of
amazing
length
and
loudness
at
his
best
he
sounded
like
a
cross
between
a
bullfrog
and
a
cicada
sometimes
he
would
pat
a
hand
rapidly
across
his
open
mouth
while
belching
emitting
a
sound
like
a
hoarse
indian
belch
had
been
big
and
not
really
fat
eddie
remembered
now
but
it
was
as
if
god
had
never
really
intended
for
a
boy
of
twelve
to
attain
such
remarkable
size
if
he
had
not
died
that
summer
he
might
have
grown
to
sixsix
or
better
and
might
have
learned
along
the
way
how
to
maneuver
his
outsized
body
through
a
world
of
smaller
denizens
he
might
even
eddie
thought
have
learned
gentleness
but
at
twelve
he
had
been
both
clumsy
and
mean
not
retarded
but
almost
seeming
so
because
all
his
body
actions
seemed
so
amazingly
graceless
and
lunging
he
had
none
of
stanleys
builtin
rhythms
it
was
as
if
belch
body
did
not
talk
to
his
brain
at
all
but
existed
in
its
own
cosmos
of
slow
thunder
eddie
could
remember
the
evening
a
long
slow
fly
ball
had
been
hit
directly
to
belch
position
in
the
outfield
belch
didn't
even
have
to
move
he
stood
looking
up
raised
his
glove
in
an
almost
aimless
punching
gesture
and
instead
of
settling
into
his
glove
the
ball
had
struck
him
squarely
on
top
of
the
head
producing
a
hollow
bonk
sound
it
was
as
if
the
ball
had
been
dropped
from
three
stories
up
onto
the
roof
of
a
ford
sedan
it
bounced
up
a
good
four
feet
and
came
down
neatly
into
belch
glove
an
unfortunate
kid
named
owen
phillips
had
laughed
at
that
bonking
sound
belch
had
walked
over
to
him
and
had
kicked
his
ass
so
hard
that
the
phillips
kid
had
run
screaming
for
home
with
a
hole
in
the
seat
of
his
pants
no
one
else
laughed
at
least
not
on
the
outside
eddie
supposed
that
if
richie
tozier
had
been
there
he
wouldn't
have
been
able
to
help
it
and
belch
probably
would
have
put
him
in
the
hospital
belch
was
similarly
slow
at
the
plate
he
was
easy
to
strike
out
and
if
he
hit
a
grounder
even
the
most
fumblefingered
infielders
had
no
trouble
throwing
him
out
at
first
but
when
he
got
all
of
one
it
went
a
long
long
way
the
two
balls
eddie
had
seen
belch
hit
over
the
fence
had
both
been
wonders
the
first
had
never
been
recovered
although
more
than
a
dozen
boys
had
tramped
back
and
forth
over
the
steeply
slanting
slope
which
plunged
down
into
the
barrens
looking
for
it
the
second
however
had
been
recovered
the
ball
belonged
to
another
sixthgrader
eddie
could
not
now
remember
what
his
real
name
had
been
only
that
all
the
other
kids
called
him
snuffy
because
he
always
had
a
cold
and
had
been
in
use
for
most
of
the
late
spring
and
early
summer
of
as
a
result
it
was
no
longer
the
nearly
perfect
spherical
creation
of
white
horsehide
and
red
stitching
that
it
had
been
when
it
came
out
of
the
box
it
was
scuffed
grassstained
and
cut
in
several
places
by
its
hundreds
of
bouncing
trips
over
the
gravel
in
the
outfield
its
stitching
was
beginning
to
come
unravelled
in
one
place
and
eddie
who
shagged
foul
balls
when
his
asthma
wasn't
too
bad
relishing
every
casual
thanks
kid
when
he
threw
the
ball
back
to
the
playing
field
knew
that
soon
someone
would
produce
a
roll
of
black
cat
friction
tape
and
embalm
it
so
they
could
get
another
week
or
so
out
of
it
but
before
that
day
came
a
seventhgrader
with
the
unlikely
name
of
stringer
dedham
tossed
what
he
fancied
a
change
of
speed
pitch
to
belch
huggins
belch
timed
the
pitch
perfectly
the
slow
ones
were
you
should
pardon
the
pun
just
his
speed
and
hit
snuffy
elderly
spalding
so
hard
that
the
cover
came
right
off
and
fluttered
down
just
a
few
feet
shy
of
second
base
like
a
big
white
moth
the
ball
itself
had
continued
up
and
up
into
a
gorgeous
twilit
sky
unravelling
and
unravelling
as
it
went
kids
turning
to
follow
its
progress
in
dumb
wonder
up
and
over
the
chainlink
fence
it
went
still
rising
and
eddie
remembered
stringer
dedham
had
said
holy
shit
in
a
soft
and
awestruck
voice
as
it
went
riding
a
track
into
the
sky
and
they
had
all
seen
the
unwinding
string
and
maybe
even
before
it
hit
six
boys
had
been
monkeying
up
that
fence
and
eddie
could
remember
tony
tracker
laughing
in
an
amazed
loonlike
way
and
crying
that
one
would
have
been
out
of
yankee
stadium
do
you
hear
me
that
one
would
have
been
out
of
fucking
yankee
stadiu
it
had
been
peter
gordon
who
found
the
ball
wt
far
from
the
stream
the
loser
club
would
dam
up
less
than
three
weeks
later
what
was
left
was
not
even
three
inches
through
the
center
it
was
some
kind
of
cockeyed
miracle
that
the
twine
had
never
broken
by
unspoken
consent
the
boys
had
brought
the
remains
of
snuffy
ball
back
to
tony
tracker
who
examined
it
without
saying
a
word
surrounded
by
boys
who
were
likewise
silent
seen
from
a
distance
that
circle
of
boys
standing
around
the
tall
man
with
the
big
sloping
belly
might
have
seemed
almost
religious
in
its
intent
the
veneration
of
a
holy
object
belch
huggins
had
not
even
run
around
the
bases
he
only
stood
among
the
others
like
a
boy
who
had
no
precise
idea
of
where
he
was
what
tony
tracker
handed
him
that
day
was
smaller
than
a
tennis
ball
eddie
lost
in
these
memories
walked
from
the
place
where
home
had
been
across
the
pitcher
mound
only
it
had
never
been
a
mound
it
had
been
a
depression
from
which
the
gravel
had
been
scraped
clean
and
out
into
shortstop
country
he
paused
briefly
struck
by
the
silence
and
then
strolled
on
out
to
the
chainlink
fence
it
was
rustier
than
ever
and
overgrown
by
some
sort
of
ugly
climbing
vine
but
still
there
looking
through
it
he
could
see
how
the
ground
sloped
away
aggressively
green
the
barrens
were
more
junglelike
than
ever
and
for
the
first
time
he
found
himself
wondering
why
a
stretch
of
such
tangled
and
virulent
growth
should
have
been
called
the
barrens
at
all
it
was
many
things
but
barren
was
not
one
of
them
why
not
he
wilderness
or
the
jungle
barrens
it
had
an
ominous
almost
sinister
sound
but
what
it
conjured
up
in
the
mind
were
not
tangles
of
shrubs
and
trees
so
thick
they
had
to
fight
for
sunspace
it
called
up
pictures
of
sand
dunes
shifting
away
endlessly
or
gray
slate
expanses
of
hardpan
and
desert
barren
mike
had
said
earlier
that
they
were
all
barren
and
it
seemed
true
enough
seven
of
them
and
not
a
kid
among
them
even
in
these
days
of
planned
parenthood
that
was
bucking
the
odds
he
boked
through
the
rusty
diamondshapes
hearing
the
faraway
drone
of
cars
on
kansas
street
the
faraway
trickle
and
rush
of
water
down
below
he
could
see
glints
of
it
in
the
spring
sunshine
like
flashes
of
glass
the
bamboo
stands
were
still
down
there
looking
unhealthily
white
like
patches
of
fungus
in
all
the
green
beyond
them
in
the
marshy
stretches
of
ground
bordering
the
kenduskeag
there
was
supposed
to
have
been
quickmud
i
spent
the
happiest
times
of
my
childhood
down
there
in
that
mess
he
thought
and
shivered
he
was
about
to
turn
away
when
something
else
caught
his
eye
a
cement
cylinder
with
a
heavy
steel
cap
on
the
top
morlock
holes
ben
used
to
call
them
laughing
with
his
mouth
but
not
quite
laughing
with
his
eyes
if
you
went
over
to
one
it
would
stand
maybe
waisthigh
on
you
if
you
were
a
kid
and
you
would
see
the
words
derry
department
of
public
works
stamped
in
raised
metal
in
a
semicircle
and
you
could
hear
a
humming
noise
from
deep
inside
some
sort
of
machinery
morlock
holes
that
where
we
went
in
august
in
the
end
we
went
into
one
of
ben
morlock
holes
into
the
sewers
but
after
awhile
they
weren't
sewers
anymore
they
were
were
what
patrick
hockstetter
was
down
there
before
it
took
him
beverly
saw
him
doing
something
bad
it
made
her
laugh
but
she
knew
it
was
bad
something
to
do
with
henry
bowers
wasn't
it
yes
i
think
so
and
he
turned
away
suddenly
and
started
back
toward
the
abandoned
depot
not
wanting
to
look
down
into
the
barrens
anymore
not
liking
the
thoughts
they
conjured
up
he
wanted
to
be
home
with
myra
he
didn't
want
to
be
here
he
catch
ki
he
turned
toward
the
sound
of
the
voice
and
here
came
some
sort
of
a
ball
right
over
the
fence
and
oward
him
it
struck
the
gravel
and
bounced
eddie
stuck
out
his
hand
and
caught
it
in
his
unthinking
reflex
the
catch
was
so
neat
it
was
almost
elegant
he
looked
down
at
what
was
in
his
hand
and
everything
inside
him
went
cool
and
loose
once
it
had
been
a
baseball
now
it
was
only
a
stringwrapped
sphere
because
the
cover
had
been
knocked
off
he
could
see
the
string
trailing
away
it
went
over
the
top
of
the
fence
like
a
strand
of
spiderweb
and
disappeared
into
the
barrens
oh
jesus
he
thought
oh
jesus
its
here
it
here
with
me
now
come
on
down
and
play
eddie
the
voice
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence
said
and
eddie
realized
with
a
fainting
sort
of
horror
that
it
was
the
voice
of
belch
huggins
who
had
been
murdered
in
the
tunnek
under
derry
in
august
of
and
now
here
was
belch
himself
struggling
up
and
over
the
bank
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence
he
wore
a
pinstriped
new
york
yankees
baseball
uniform
that
was
flecked
with
bits
of
autumn
leaves
and
smeared
with
green
he
was
belch
but
he
was
also
the
leper
a
creature
hideously
arisen
from
long
years
in
a
wet
grave
the
flesh
of
his
heavy
face
hung
in
putrescent
strings
and
runners
one
eyesocket
was
empty
things
squirmed
in
his
hair
he
wore
a
mossslimed
baseballglove
on
one
hand
he
poked
the
rotting
fingers
of
his
right
hand
through
the
diamonds
of
the
chainlink
fence
and
when
he
curled
them
eddie
heard
a
dreadful
squirting
sound
which
he
thought
might
drive
him
mad
that
one
would
have
been
out
of
yankee
stadium
belch
said
and
grinned
a
toad
noxiously
white
and
squirming
dropped
from
his
mouth
and
tumbled
to
the
ground
do
you
hear
me
that
one
would
have
been
out
of
fucking
yankee
stadium
and
by
the
way
eddie
do
you
want
a
blow
job
i'll
do
it
for
a
dime
hell
i'll
do
it
for
free
belch
face
changed
the
jellylike
bulb
of
nose
fell
in
revealing
two
raw
red
channels
that
eddie
had
seen
in
his
dreams
his
hair
coarsened
and
drew
back
from
his
temples
turned
cobweb
white
the
rotting
skin
on
his
forehead
split
open
revealing
white
bone
covered
with
a
mucusy
substance
like
the
bleared
lens
of
a
searchlight
belch
was
gone
the
thing
which
had
been
under
the
porch
at
neibolt
street
was
here
now
bobby
blows
me
for
a
dime
it
crooned
beginning
to
climb
the
fence
it
left
little
pieces
of
its
flesh
in
the
diamond
shapes
the
crisscrossing
wires
made
the
fence
jingled
and
rattled
with
its
weight
when
it
touched
the
climbing
vinelike
weeds
they
turned
black
he
will
do
it
anytime
fifteen
cents
for
overtime
eddie
tried
to
scream
nothing
but
a
dry
senseless
squeak
came
out
of
him
his
lungs
felt
like
the
world
oldest
ocarinas
he
looked
down
at
the
ball
in
his
hand
and
suddenly
blood
began
to
sweat
up
from
between
the
wrapped
strings
it
pattered
to
the
gravel
and
splashed
on
his
loafers
he
threw
it
down
and
took
two
lurching
staggersteps
backward
his
eyes
bulging
from
his
face
rubbing
his
hands
on
the
front
of
his
shirt
the
leper
had
reached
the
top
of
the
fence
its
head
swayed
in
silhouette
against
the
sky
a
nightmare
shape
like
a
bloated
halloween
jackolantern
its
tongue
lolled
out
four
feet
long
perhaps
six
it
twined
its
way
down
the
fence
like
a
snake
from
the
leper
grinning
mouth
there
one
second
gone
the
next
it
did
not
fade
like
a
ghost
in
a
movie
it
simply
winked
out
of
existence
but
eddie
heard
a
sound
which
confirmed
its
essential
solidity
a
pop
sound
like
a
cork
blowing
out
of
a
champagne
bottle
it
was
the
sound
of
air
rushing
in
to
fill
the
place
where
the
leper
had
been
he
turned
and
began
to
run
but
before
he
had
gone
ten
feet
four
stiff
shapes
flew
out
from
the
shadows
under
the
loadingbay
of
the
abandoned
brick
depot
he
thought
at
first
they
were
bats
and
he
screamed
and
covered
his
head
then
he
saw
that
they
were
squares
of
canvas
the
squares
of
canvas
that
had
been
the
bases
when
the
big
kids
played
here
they
whirled
and
twirled
in
the
still
air
he
had
to
duck
to
avoid
one
of
them
they
settled
in
their
accustomed
places
all
at
once
kicking
up
little
puffs
of
grit
home
first
second
third
gasping
his
breath
short
in
his
throat
eddie
ran
past
home
plate
his
lips
drawn
back
his
face
as
white
as
cottage
cheese
whack
the
sound
of
a
bat
hitting
a
phantom
ball
and
then
eddie
stopped
the
strength
going
out
of
his
legs
a
groan
passing
his
lips
the
ground
was
bulging
in
a
straight
line
from
home
to
first
as
if
a
gigantic
gopher
was
tunneling
rapidly
just
below
the
surface
of
the
ground
gravel
rolled
off
to
either
side
the
shape
under
the
earth
reached
the
base
and
the
canvas
flipped
up
into
the
air
it
went
up
so
hard
and
fast
it
made
a
popping
sound
the
sound
a
shoeshine
kid
makes
when
he
feeling
good
and
pops
the
rag
the
ground
began
to
ridge
between
first
and
second
racing
and
racing
second
base
flew
into
the
air
with
a
similar
popping
sound
and
had
barely
settled
back
before
the
shape
under
the
ground
had
reached
third
and
was
racing
for
home
home
plate
flew
up
as
vell
but
before
it
could
come
down
the
thing
had
popped
out
of
the
ground
like
some
grisly
partyfavor
and
the
thing
was
tony
tracker
his
face
a
skull
to
which
a
few
blackened
chunks
of
flesh
still
clung
his
white
shirt
a
mess
of
rotted
linen
strings
he
poked
out
of
the
earth
at
home
plate
from
the
waist
up
swaying
back
and
forth
like
a
grotesque
worm
don't
matter
how
much
you
choke
up
on
that
ashhandl
tony
tracker
said
in
a
gritty
grinding
voice
exposed
teeth
grinned
in
lunatic
chumminess
don't
matter
wheezy
we'll
get
you
you
and
your
friends
we'll
have
a
bawl”
eddie
shrieked
and
staggered
away
there
was
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
he
shrank
away
from
it
the
hand
tightened
for
a
moment
then
gave
way
he
tumed
it
was
greta
bowie
she
was
dead
half
of
her
face
was
gone
maggots
crawled
in
the
churned
red
meat
that
was
left
she
held
a
green
balloon
in
one
hand
car
crash
the
recognizable
half
of
her
mouth
said
and
grinned
the
grin
caused
an
unspeakable
ripping
sound
and
eddie
could
see
raw
tendons
moving
like
terrible
straps
i
was
eighteen
eddie
drunk
and
done
up
on
reds
your
friends
are
here
eddie
eddie
backed
away
from
her
his
hands
held
up
in
front
of
his
face
she
walked
toward
him
blood
had
splashed
then
dried
on
her
legs
in
long
splotches
she
was
wearing
penny
loafers
and
now
beyond
her
he
saw
the
ultimate
horror
patrick
hockstetter
was
shambling
toward
him
across
the
outfield
he
too
was
wearing
a
new
york
yankees
uniform
eddie
ran
greta
clutched
at
him
again
tearing
his
shirt
and
spilling
some
terrible
liquid
down
the
back
of
his
collar
tony
tracker
was
pulling
himself
out
of
his
mansized
gopher
run
patrick
hockstetter
stumbled
and
staggered
eddie
ran
not
knowing
where
he
was
finding
the
breath
to
run
but
running
somehow
anyway
and
as
he
ran
he
saw
words
floating
in
front
of
him
the
words
that
had
been
printed
on
the
side
of
the
green
balloon
greta
bowie
had
been
holding
asthma
medicine
causes
lung
cancer
compliments
of
center
street
drug
eddie
ran
he
ran
and
ran
and
at
some
point
he
collapsed
in
a
dead
faint
near
mccarron
park
and
some
kids
saw
him
and
steered
clear
of
him
because
he
looked
like
a
wino
to
them
like
he
might
have
some
kind
of
weird
disease
for
all
they
knew
he
might
even
be
the
killer
and
they
talked
about
reporting
him
to
the
police
but
in
the
end
they
didn't
bev
rogan
pays
a
call
beverly
walked
absently
down
main
street
from
the
derry
town
house
where
she
had
gone
to
change
into
a
pair
of
bluejeans
and
a
bright
yellow
smockblouse
she
was
not
thinking
about
where
she
was
going
instead
she
thought
this
your
hair
is
winter
fire
january
embers
my
heart
bums
there
too
she
had
hidden
that
in
her
bottom
drawer
beneath
her
underwear
her
nother
might
have
seen
it
but
that
was
all
right
the
important
thing
was
that
was
one
drawer
her
father
never
looked
in
if
he
had
seen
it
he
might
have
looked
at
her
with
that
bright
almost
friendly
and
utterly
paralyzing
stare
of
his
and
asked
in
hs
almost
friendly
way
you
been
doing
something
you
shouldn't
be
doing
bev
you
been
doing
something
with
some
boy
and
if
she
said
yes
or
if
she
said
no
there
would
be
a
quick
whambam
so
quick
and
so
hard
it
didn't
even
hurt
at
first
it
took
a
few
seconds
for
the
vacuum
to
dissipate
and
the
pain
to
fill
the
place
were
the
vacuum
had
been
then
his
voice
again
almost
friendly
worry
a
lot
about
you
beverly
i
worry
an
awful
lot
you
got
to
grow
up
isn't
that
so
her
father
might
still
be
living
here
in
derry
he
had
been
living
here
the
last
time
she
had
heard
from
him
but
that
had
been
how
long
ago
ten
years
long
before
she
had
married
tom
anyway
she
had
gotten
a
postcard
from
him
not
a
plain
postcard
like
the
one
the
poem
had
been
written
on
but
one
showing
the
hideous
plastic
statue
of
paul
bunyan
which
stood
in
front
of
city
center
the
statue
had
been
erected
sometime
in
the
fifties
and
it
had
been
one
of
the
landmarks
of
her
childhood
but
her
father
card
had
called
up
no
nostalgia
or
memories
for
her
it
might
as
well
have
been
a
card
showing
gateway
arch
in
saint
louis
or
the
golden
gate
bridge
in
san
francisco
hope
you
are
doing
well
and
being
good
the
card
read
hope
you
will
send
me
something
if
you
can
as
i
don't
have
much
i
love
you
bevvie
dad
he
had
loved
her
and
in
some
ways
she
supposed
that
had
everything
to
do
with
why
she
had
fallen
so
desperately
in
love
with
bill
denbrough
that
long
summer
of
because
of
all
the
boys
bill
was
the
me
who
projected
the
sense
of
authority
she
associated
with
her
father
but
it
was
a
different
sort
of
authority
somehow
it
was
authority
that
listened
she
saw
no
assumption
in
either
his
eyes
or
his
actions
that
he
believed
her
father
kind
of
worrying
to
be
the
only
reason
authority
needed
to
exist
as
if
people
were
pets
to
be
both
cosseted
and
disciplined
whatever
the
reasons
by
the
end
of
their
first
meeting
as
a
complete
group
in
july
of
that
year
that
meeting
of
which
bill
had
taken
such
complete
and
effortless
charge
she
had
been
madly
headoverheels
in
love
with
him
calling
it
a
simple
schoolgirl
crush
was
like
saying
a
rollsroyce
was
a
vehicle
with
four
wheels
something
like
a
haywagon
she
did
not
giggle
wildly
and
blish
when
she
saw
him
nor
did
she
chalk
his
name
on
trees
or
write
it
on
the
walls
of
the
kissing
bridge
she
simply
lived
with
his
face
in
her
heart
all
the
time
a
kind
of
sweet
hurtful
ache
she
would
have
died
for
him
it
was
natural
enough
she
supposed
for
her
to
want
to
believe
it
had
been
bill
who
sent
her
the
lovepoem
although
she
had
never
gotten
so
far
gone
as
to
actually
convince
herself
it
was
so
no
she
had
known
who
wrote
the
poem
and
later
on
at
some
point
hadn't
its
author
admitted
this
to
her
yes
ben
had
told
her
so
although
she
could
not
now
remember
not
for
the
life
of
her
just
when
or
under
what
circumstances
he
had
actually
said
it
out
loud
and
although
his
love
for
her
had
been
almost
as
well
hidden
as
the
love
she
had
felt
for
bill
but
you
told
him
bevvie
you
did
you
told
him
you
loved
it
was
obvious
to
anyone
who
really
looked
and
who
was
kind
it
was
in
the
way
he
was
always
careful
to
keep
some
space
between
them
in
the
draw
of
his
breath
when
she
touched
his
arm
or
his
hand
in
the
way
he
dressed
when
he
knew
he
was
going
to
see
her
dear
sweet
fat
ben
it
had
ended
somehow
that
difficult
preadolescent
triangle
but
just
how
it
had
ended
was
one
of
the
things
she
still
couldn't
remember
she
thought
that
ben
had
confessed
authoring
and
sending
the
little
lovepoem
she
thought
she
had
told
bill
she
loved
him
that
she
would
love
him
forever
and
somehow
those
two
tellings
had
helped
save
all
of
their
lives
or
had
they
she
couldn't
remember
these
memories
or
memories
of
memories
that
was
really
closer
to
what
they
were
were
hike
islands
that
were
not
really
islands
at
all
but
only
knobs
of
a
single
coral
spine
which
happened
to
poke
up
above
the
waterline
not
separate
at
all
but
one
piece
yet
whenever
she
tried
to
dive
deep
and
see
the
rest
a
maddening
image
intervened
the
grackles
which
came
back
each
spring
to
new
england
crowding
the
telephone
lines
trees
and
rooftops
jostling
for
places
and
filling
the
thawing
latemarch
air
with
their
raucous
gossip
this
image
came
to
her
again
and
again
foreign
and
disturbing
like
a
heavy
radio
beam
that
blankets
the
signal
you
really
want
to
pick
up
she
realized
with
sudden
shock
that
she
was
standing
outside
of
the
kleenkloze
washateria
where
she
and
stan
uris
and
ben
and
eddie
had
taken
the
rags
that
day
in
late
june
rags
stained
with
blood
which
only
they
could
see
the
windows
were
now
soaped
opaque
and
there
was
a
handlettered
for
sale
by
owner
sign
taped
to
the
door
peering
between
the
swashes
of
soap
she
could
see
an
empty
room
with
lighter
squares
on
the
dirty
yellow
walls
where
the
washers
had
stood
i'm
going
home
she
thought
dismally
but
walked
on
anyway
this
neighborhood
hadn't
changed
much
a
few
more
of
the
trees
were
gone
probably
elms
felled
by
disease
the
houses
looked
a
little
tackier
broken
windows
seemed
slightly
more
common
than
they
had
been
when
she
was
a
girl
some
of
the
broken
panes
had
been
replaced
with
cardboard
some
hadn't
and
here
she
stood
in
front
of
the
apartment
house
lower
main
street
still
here
the
peeling
white
she
remembered
had
become
a
peeling
chocolate
brown
at
some
point
during
the
years
between
but
it
was
still
unmistakable
there
was
the
window
which
looked
in
on
what
had
been
their
kitchen
there
was
the
window
of
her
bedroom
jim
doyon
you
come
out
of
that
road
come
out
right
now
you
want
to
get
run
over
and
killed
she
shivered
hugging
her
arms
across
her
breasts
in
an
x
cupping
her
elbows
in
her
palms
daddy
could
still
be
living
here
oh
yes
he
could
he
wouldn't
move
unless
he
had
to
just
walk
on
up
there
beverly
look
at
the
mailboxes
three
boxes
for
three
apartments
just
like
in
the
old
days
and
if
there
one
which
says
marsh
you
can
ring
the
bell
and
pretty
soon
there'll
be
the
shuffle
of
slippers
down
the
hall
and
the
door
will
open
and
you
can
look
at
him
the
man
whose
sperm
made
you
redheaded
and
lefthanded
and
gave
you
the
ability
to
draw
remember
how
he
used
to
draw
he
could
draw
anything
he
wanted
if
he
felt
like
it
that
is
he
didn't
feel
like
it
often
i
guess
he
had
too
many
things
to
worry
about
but
when
he
did
you
used
to
sit
for
hours
and
watch
while
he
drew
cats
and
dogs
and
horses
and
cows
with
moo
coming
out
of
their
mouths
in
balloons
you'd
laugh
and
he'd
laugh
and
then
he'd
say
now
you
bevvie
and
when
you
held
the
pen
he'd
guide
your
hand
and
you'd
see
the
cow
or
the
cat
or
the
smiling
man
unspooling
beneath
your
own
fingers
while
you
smelled
his
mennen
skin
bracer
and
the
warmth
of
his
skin
go
on
up
beverly
ring
the
bell
he'll
come
and
he'll
be
old
the
lines
will
be
drawn
deep
in
his
face
and
his
teeth
those
that
are
left
will
be
yellow
and
he'll
look
at
you
and
he'll
say
why
it
bevvie
bevvie
come
home
to
see
her
old
dad
come
on
in
bevvie
i'm
so
glad
to
see
you
i'm
glad
because
i
worry
about
you
bewvie
i
worry
a
lot
she
walked
slowly
up
the
path
and
the
weeds
growing
up
between
the
cracked
concrete
sections
brushed
at
the
legs
of
her
jeans
she
looked
closely
at
the
firstfloor
windows
but
they
were
curtained
off
she
looked
at
the
mailboxes
third
floor
starkweather
second
floor
burke
first
floor
her
breath
caught
marsh
but
i
won't
ring
i
don't
want
to
see
him
i
won't
ring
the
bell
this
was
a
firm
decision
at
last
the
decision
that
opened
the
gate
to
a
full
and
useful
lifetime
of
firm
decisions
she
walked
down
the
path
back
to
downtown
up
to
the
derry
town
house
packed
cabbed
flew
toh
tom
to
bug
out
lived
successfully
died
happily
rang
the
bell
she
heard
the
familiar
chimes
from
the
living
room
chimes
that
had
always
sounded
to
her
like
a
chinese
name
chingchong
silence
no
answer
she
shifted
on
the
porch
from
one
foot
to
the
other
suddenly
needing
to
pee
no
one
home
she
thought
relieved
can
go
now
instead
she
rang
again
chingchong
no
answer
she
thought
of
ben
lovely
little
poem
and
tried
to
remember
exactly
when
and
how
he
had
confessed
its
authorship
and
why
for
a
brief
second
it
called
up
an
association
with
having
her
first
menstrual
period
had
she
begun
menstruating
at
eleven
surely
not
although
her
breasts
had
begun
their
first
achy
growth
around
midwinter
why

then
intervenng
a
mental
picture
of
thousands
of
grackles
on
phone
lines
and
rooftops
all
babbling
at
a
white
spring
sky
til
leave
now
i've
rung
twice
that
enough
but
she
rang
again
chingchong
now
she
heard
someone
approaching
and
the
sound
was
just
as
she
had
imagined
the
tired
whisper
of
old
slippers
she
looked
around
wildly
and
came
very
very
close
to
just
taking
to
her
heels
could
she
make
it
down
the
cement
walk
and
around
the
corner
leaving
her
father
to
think
it
had
been
nothing
but
kids
playing
pranks
hey
mister
you
got
prince
albert
ina
can
she
let
out
a
sudden
sharp
breath
and
had
to
tighten
her
throat
because
what
wanted
to
come
out
was
a
laugh
of
relief
it
wasn't
her
father
at
all
standing
in
the
doorway
and
looking
out
at
her
was
a
tall
woman
in
her
late
seventies
her
hair
was
long
and
gorgeous
mostly
white
but
shot
through
with
lodes
of
purest
gold
behind
her
rimless
spectacles
were
eyes
as
blue
as
the
water
in
the
fjords
her
ancestors
had
perhaps
hailed
from
she
wore
a
purple
dress
of
watered
silk
it
was
shabby
but
still
dignified
her
wrinkled
face
was
kind
yes
miss
tm
sorry
beverly
said
the
urge
to
laugh
had
passed
as
swiftly
as
it
had
come
she
noticed
that
the
old
woman
wore
a
cameo
at
her
throat
it
was
almost
certainly
real
ivory
surrounded
by
a
band
of
gold
so
thin
it
was
nearly
invisible
i
must
have
rung
the
wrong
bell
or
rang
the
wrong
bell
on
purpose
her
mind
whispered
i
meant
to
ring
for
marsh
marsh
her
forehead
wrinkled
delicately
yes
you
see
there
no
marsh
here
the
old
woman
said
but
unless
you
don't
mean
alvin
marsh
do
you
ye
beverly
said
my
father
the
old
woman
hand
rose
to
the
cameo
and
touched
it
she
peered
more
closely
at
beverly
making
her
feel
ridiculously
young
as
if
she
should
perhaps
have
a
box
of
girl
scout
cookies
in
her
hands
or
maybe
some
tags
support
the
derry
high
school
tigers
then
the
old
woman
smiled
a
kind
smile
that
was
nonetheless
sad
why
you
have
fallen
out
of
touch
miss
i
don't
want
to
be
the
one
who
tells
you
this
a
stranger
but
your
father
has
been
dead
these
last
five
years
but
on
the
bell
she
looked
again
and
uttered
a
small
bewildered
sound
that
was
not
quite
a
laugh
in
her
agitation
in
her
subconscious
but
rocksolid
certainty
that
her
old
man
would
still
be
here
she
had
read
kersh
as
marsh
you're
mrs
kersh
she
asked
she
was
staggered
by
this
news
of
her
father
but
she
also
felt
stupid
about
the
mistake
the
lady
would
think
her
little
more
than
illiterate
mrs
kers
she
agreed
you
did
you
know
my
dad
very
little
did
i
know
him
mrs
kersh
said
she
sounded
a
little
like
yoda
in
the
empire
strikes
back
and
beverly
felt
like
laughing
again
when
had
her
emotions
gone
whipsawing
so
violently
back
and
forth
the
truth
was
she
couldn't
remember
a
time
but
she
was
dismally
afraid
she
would
before
much
longer
he
rented
the
groundfloor
apartment
before
me
we
saw
each
other
me
coming
and
him
going
over
a
space
of
a
few
days
he
moved
down
to
reward
lane
do
you
know
it
ye
beverly
said
roward
lane
branched
off
from
lower
main
street
four
blocks
farther
down
where
the
apartment
buildings
were
smaller
and
even
more
desperately
shabby
used
to
see
him
at
the
costello
avenue
market
sometimes
mrs
kersh
said
and
at
the
washateria
before
they
closed
it
we
passed
a
word
from
time
to
time
we
girl
you're
pale
i'm
sorry
come
in
and
let
me
give
you
tea
no
i
couldn't
beverly
said
weakly
but
in
fact
she
actually
felt
pale
like
clouded
glass
that
you
could
nearly
look
through
she
could
use
tea
and
a
chair
in
which
to
sit
and
drink
it
you
could
and
you
will
mrs
kersh
said
warmly
it
the
least
i
can
do
for
having
told
you
such
unpleasant
news
before
she
could
protest
beverly
found
herself
being
led
up
the
gloomy
hall
and
into
her
old
apartment
which
now
seemed
much
smaller
but
safe
enough
safe
she
supposed
because
almost
everything
was
different
instead
of
the
pinktopped
formica
table
with
its
three
chairs
there
was
a
small
round
table
really
not
much
bigger
than
an
endtable
with
silk
flowers
in
a
pottery
vase
instead
of
the
old
kelvinator
refrigerator
with
the
round
drum
on
top
her
father
tinkered
with
it
constantly
to
keep
it
going
there
was
a
coppercolored
frigidaire
the
stove
was
small
but
efficient
looking
there
was
an
amana
radar
range
above
it
bright
blue
curtains
hung
in
the
windows
and
she
could
see
flowerboxes
outside
them
the
floor
linoleum
when
she
was
a
girl
here
had
been
stripped
to
its
original
wood
many
applications
of
oil
made
it
glow
mellowly
mrs
kersh
looked
around
from
the
stove
where
she
was
placing
a
teapot
you
grew
up
here
ye
beverly
said
but
it
very
different
now
so
trim
and
tidy
wonderful
how
kind
you
are
mrs
kersh
said
and
her
smile
made
her
younger
it
was
radiant
i
have
a
little
money
you
see
not
much
but
with
my
social
security
i
am
comfortable
once
i
was
a
girl
in
sweden
i
came
to
this
country
in
a
girl
of
fourteen
with
no
money
which
is
the
best
way
to
learn
the
value
of
money
would
you
agree
ye
bev
said
at
the
hospital
i
worked
mrs
kersh
said
many
years
from
i
worked
there
i
rose
to
the
position
of
head
housekeeper
all
the
keys
i
had
my
husband
invested
our
money
quite
well
now
i
have
reached
a
little
harbor
look
around
miss
while
the
water
boils
no
i
couldn't
please
still
i
feel
guilty
look
if
you
like
and
so
she
did
look
her
parents
bedroom
was
now
mrs
kersh
bedroom
and
the
difference
was
profound
the
room
seemed
brighter
and
airier
now
a
large
cedar
chest
the
initals
rg
inlaid
into
it
breathed
its
gentle
aroma
into
the
air
a
gigantic
surprisequilt
lay
on
the
bed
on
it
she
could
see
women
drawing
water
boys
driving
cattle
men
building
haystacks
a
wonderful
quilt
her
room
had
become
a
sewing
room
a
black
singer
machine
stood
on
a
wroughtiron
table
under
a
pair
of
starkly
efficient
tensor
lamps
a
picture
of
jesus
hung
on
one
wall
a
picture
of
john
f
kennedy
on
another
a
beautiful
breakfront
stood
below
the
picture
of
jfk
it
was
filled
with
books
instead
of
china
but
seemed
none
the
worse
for
that
she
went
into
the
bathroom
last
it
had
been
redone
in
a
rose
color
that
was
too
low
and
pleasant
to
seem
gaudy
all
of
the
fixtures
were
new
and
yet
she
approached
the
basin
feeling
that
the
old
nightmare
had
gripped
her
again
she
would
peer
down
into
that
black
and
lidless
eye
the
whispering
would
begin
and
then
the
blood
she
leaned
over
the
sink
catching
a
glimpse
of
her
pallid
face
and
dark
eyes
in
the
mirror
over
the
basin
and
then
she
stared
into
that
eye
waiting
for
the
voices
the
laughter
the
groans
the
blood
how
long
might
she
have
stood
there
bent
over
the
sink
waiting
for
the
sights
and
sounds
twentyseven
years
gone
she
didn't
know
it
was
mrs
kersh
voice
that
bd
her
return
tea
miss
she
jerked
back
the
semihypnosis
broken
and
left
the
bathroom
if
there
had
been
dark
magic
somewhere
down
in
that
drain
it
was
gone
now
or
was
sleeping
oh
you
shouldn't
have
mrs
kersh
looked
up
at
her
brightly
smiling
a
little
o
miss
if
you
knew
how
seldom
company
calls
these
days
you'd
not
say
so
why
i
put
on
more
than
this
for
the
man
from
the
bangor
hydro
who
comes
to
read
my
meter
i'm
making
him
fat
delicate
cups
and
saucers
stood
on
the
round
kitchen
table
a
clean
bonewhite
edged
with
blue
there
was
a
plate
of
small
cakes
and
cookies
beside
the
sweets
a
pewter
teapot
chuffed
mild
steam
and
pleasant
fragrance
bemused
bev
thought
that
the
only
things
missing
were
the
tiny
sandwiches
with
the
crusts
cut
off
auntsandwiches
she'd
thought
them
always
one
word
three
main
types
of
auntsandwiches
cream
cheese
and
olive
watercress
and
egg
salad
sit
down
said
mrs
kersh
sit
down
miss
and
i'll
pour
out
tm
not
a
miss
beverly
said
and
raised
her
left
hand
so
that
her
ring
would
show
mrs
kersh
smiled
and
pushed
a
hand
through
the
air
pshaw
the
gesture
said
i
call
all
the
pretty
young
girls
miss
she
said
just
a
habit
don't
take
offense
n
beverly
said
not
at
all
but
for
some
reason
she
felt
a
feathertouch
of
unease
there
was
something
in
the
old
woman
smile
that
had
seemed
a
little
what
unpleasant
false
knowing
but
that
was
ridiculous
wasn't
it
i
love
what
you've
done
to
the
place
do
you
mrs
kersh
said
and
poured
out
the
tea
looked
dark
muddy
beverly
wasn't
sure
she
wanted
to
drink
it
and
suddenly
she
wasn't
sure
she
wanted
to
be
here
at
all
it
did
say
marsh
under
the
doorbell
her
mind
whispered
suddenly
and
she
was
frightened
mrs
kersh
passed
her
tea
thank
you
beverly
said
the
look
of
it
might
have
been
muddy
the
aroma
however
was
wonderful
she
tasted
it
was
fine
stop
jumping
at
shadows
she
told
herself
that
cedar
chest
in
particular
is
a
wonderful
piece
an
antique
that
one
mrs
kersh
said
and
laughed
beverly
noticed
that
the
old
woman
beauty
was
flawed
on
only
one
score
and
that
was
common
enough
here
in
the
northlands
her
teeth
were
very
bad
stronglooking
but
bad
all
the
same
they
were
yellow
and
the
front
two
had
crossed
each
other
the
canines
seemed
very
long
almost
like
tusks
they
were
white
when
she
came
to
the
door
she
smiled
and
you
thought
to
yourself
how
white
they
were
suddenly
she
was
not
just
a
little
frightened
suddenly
she
wanted
needed
to
be
away
from
here
very
old
oh
yes
mrs
kersh
exclaimed
and
drank
her
cup
of
tea
off
at
a
single
gulp
with
a
sudden
shocking
slurping
sound
she
smiled
at
beverly
grinned
at
her
and
beverly
saw
that
the
woman
eyes
had
changed
too
the
corneas
were
now
yellow
ancient
threaded
with
bleary
stitches
of
red
her
hair
was
thinner
the
braid
looked
malnourished
no
longer
silver
shot
with
bright
yellow
but
a
dull
gray
very
old
mrs
kersh
reminisced
over
her
empty
cup
looking
slyly
at
beverly
from
her
yellowed
eyes
her
snaggle
teeth
showed
in
that
repulsive
almost
leering
grin
from
home
with
me
it
came
the
rg
carved
into
it
you
noticed
yes
her
voice
came
from
far
away
and
a
part
of
her
brain
yammered
if
she
doesn't
know
you've
seen
the
change
perhaps
you're
still
all
right
if
she
doesn't
know
doesn't
see
my
father
she
said
pronouncing
it
fodder
and
beverly
saw
that
her
dress
had
also
changed
it
had
become
a
scabrous
peeling
black
the
cameo
was
a
skull
its
jaw
hung
in
a
diseased
gape
his
name
was
robert
gray
better
known
as
bob
gray
better
known
as
pennywise
the
dancing
clown
although
that
was
not
his
name
either
but
he
did
love
his
joke
my
fadder
she
laughed
again
some
of
her
teeth
had
turned
as
black
as
her
dress
the
wrinkles
in
her
skin
now
cut
deep
her
milkrose
skin
had
gone
a
sickly
yellow
her
ringers
were
claws
she
grinned
at
beverly
have
something
to
eat
dear
her
voice
had
risen
half
an
octave
but
the
octave
was
cracked
in
this
register
and
her
voice
was
the
sound
of
a
crypt
door
swinging
mindlessly
on
hinges
clogged
with
black
earth
no
thank
you
beverly
heard
her
mouth
say
in
a
child
high
ohimustbe
going
voice
the
words
did
not
seem
to
originate
in
her
brain
rather
they
came
out
of
her
mouth
and
then
had
to
travel
around
to
her
ears
before
she
was
aware
of
what
she
had
said
n
the
witch
asked
and
grinned
her
claws
scrabbled
on
the
plate
and
she
began
to
cram
thin
molasses
cookies
and
delicate
frosted
slices
of
cake
into
her
mouth
with
both
hands
her
horrid
teeth
plunged
and
reared
plunged
and
reared
her
fingernails
long
and
dirty
dug
into
the
sweets
crumbs
tumbled
down
the
bony
slab
of
her
chin
her
breath
was
the
smell
of
longdead
things
burst
wide
open
by
the
gases
of
their
own
decay
her
laugh
was
now
a
dead
cackle
her
hair
was
thinner
scaly
scalp
showed
in
patches
oh
he
loved
his
joke
my
fadder
this
is
a
joke
miss
if
you
enjoy
them
my
fadder
bore
me
rather
than
my
mutter
he
shat
me
from
his
asshole
hee
hee
hee
i
ought
to
go
beverly
heard
herself
say
in
that
same
high
wounded
voice
the
voice
of
a
small
girl
who
has
been
viciously
embarrassed
at
her
first
party
there
was
no
strength
in
her
legs
she
was
dimly
aware
that
it
was
not
tea
in
her
cup
but
shit
liquid
shit
a
little
party
favor
from
the
sewers
under
the
city
she
had
drunk
some
of
that
not
much
but
a
sip
oh
god
oh
god
oh
blessed
jesus
please
please
the
woman
was
shrinking
before
her
eyes
thinning
it
was
now
a
crone
with
an
apple
doll
face
who
sat
across
from
her
giggling
in
a
high
squealing
voice
and
rocking
back
and
forth
oh
my
fadder
and
i
are
one
she
said
just
me
just
him
and
dear
if
you
are
wise
you
will
run
run
back
to
where
you
came
from
run
quickly
because
to
stay
will
mean
worse
than
your
death
no
one
who
dies
in
derry
really
dies
you
knew
that
before
believe
it
now
in
slow
motion
beverly
gathered
her
legs
under
her
as
if
from
outside
she
saw
herself
gaining
her
feet
and
backing
away
from
the
table
and
from
the
witch
in
an
agony
of
horror
and
disbelief
disbelief
because
she
realized
for
the
first
time
that
the
neat
little
diningroom
table
was
not
dark
oak
but
fudge
even
as
she
watched
the
witch
still
giggling
her
ancient
yellow
eyes
slanted
slyly
off
into
the
corner
of
the
room
broke
a
piece
of
it
off
and
stuffed
it
avidly
into
the
blackringed
trap
that
was
her
mouth
the
cups
she
saw
were
white
bark
that
had
been
carefully
looped
with
bluedyed
frosting
the
pictures
of
jesus
and
john
kennedy
were
creations
of
nearly
transparent
spun
sugar
and
as
she
looked
at
them
jesus
stuck
out
his
tongue
and
kennedy
dropped
a
stinky
wink
we're
all
waiting
for
you
the
witch
screamed
and
her
fingernails
scrabbled
over
the
surface
of
the
fudge
table
drawing
deep
scars
in
its
shining
surface
oh
yes
oh
yes
the
overhead
lights
were
globes
of
hard
candy
the
wainscotting
was
caramel
taffy
she
looked
down
and
saw
that
her
shoes
were
leaving
prints
on
the
floorboards
which
were
not
boards
at
all
but
slices
of
chocolate
the
smell
of
candy
was
cloying
oh
god
it
hansel
and
gretel
it
the
witch
the
one
that
always
scared
me
the
worst
because
she
ate
the
children
you
and
your
friends
the
witch
screamed
laughing
you
and
your
friends
in
the
cage
in
the
cage
until
the
oven
ho
she
screamed
laughter
and
beverly
ran
for
the
door
but
she
ran
as
if
in
slow
motion
the
witch
laughter
beat
and
swirled
around
her
head
a
cloud
of
bats
beverly
shrieked
the
hall
stank
of
sugar
and
nougat
and
toffee
and
sickening
synthetic
strawberries
the
doorknob
mock
crystal
when
she
came
in
was
now
a
monstrous
sugar
diamond
tworry
about
you
bevvie
i
worry
a
lot
she
turned
swirls
of
red
hair
floating
around
her
face
to
see
her
father
staggering
toward
her
down
the
hallway
wearing
the
witch
black
dress
and
skull
cameo
her
father
face
hung
with
doughy
running
flesh
his
eyes
as
black
as
obsidian
his
hands
clenching
and
unclenching
his
mouth
grinning
with
soupy
fervor
beat
you
because
i
wanted
to
fuck
you
bevvie
that
all
i
wanted
to
do
i
wanted
to
fuck
you
i
wanted
to
eat
you
i
wanted
to
eat
your
pussy
i
wanted
to
suck
your
clit
up
between
my
teeth
yumyum
bevvie
oooohhhhh
yummy
in
my
tummy
i
wanted
to
put
you
in
the
cage
and
get
the
oven
hot
and
feel
your
cunt
your
plump
cunt
and
when
it
was
plump
enough
to
eat
to
eat
eat
screaming
she
grasped
the
sticky
doorknob
and
bolted
out
onto
a
porch
that
was
decorated
with
praline
doodads
and
floored
with
fudge
far
away
dim
seeming
to
swim
in
her
vision
she
saw
cars
passing
back
and
forth
and
a
woman
pushing
a
cartful
of
groceries
back
from
costello
i
have
to
get
out
there
she
thought
just
barely
coherent
that
reality
out
there
if
i
can
only
get
out
to
the
sidewalk
won't
do
you
any
good
to
run
bevvi
her
father
my
fadder
told
her
laughing
we've
waited
a
long
time
for
this
this
is
going
to
be
fun
this
is
going
to
be
yummy
in
our
tummies
she
looked
back
again
and
now
her
dead
father
was
not
wearing
the
witch
black
dress
but
the
clown
suit
with
the
big
orange
buttons
there
was
a
style
coonskin
cap
the
kind
popularized
by
fess
parker
in
the
disney
movie
about
davy
crockett
perched
on
its
head
in
one
hand
it
held
a
bunch
of
balloons
in
the
other
it
held
the
leg
of
a
child
like
a
chicken
drumstick
written
on
each
balloon
was
the
legend
it
came
from
outer
space
tell
your
friends
i
am
the
last
of
a
dying
race
it
said
grinning
its
sunken
grin
as
it
staggered
and
lurched
down
the
porch
steps
after
her
the
only
survivor
of
a
dying
planet
i
have
come
to
rob
all
the
women
rape
all
the
men
and
learn
to
do
the
peppermint
twist
it
began
to
do
a
mad
shuckandjive
balloons
in
one
hand
severed
bleeding
leg
in
the
other
the
clown
costume
writhed
and
flapped
but
beverly
felt
no
wind
her
legs
tangled
in
each
other
and
she
spilled
to
the
pavement
throwing
out
her
palms
to
take
up
the
shock
which
went
all
the
way
to
her
shoulders
the
woman
pushing
the
grocery
cart
paused
and
looked
back
doubtfully
then
hurried
on
a
little
faster
the
clown
came
toward
her
again
casting
the
severed
leg
aside
it
landed
on
the
lawn
with
an
indescribable
thud
beverly
only
lay
sprawled
on
the
pavement
for
a
moment
sure
somewhere
inside
that
she
must
wake
soon
this
couldn't
be
real
had
to
be
a
dream
she
realized
that
wasn't
true
a
moment
before
the
clown
crooked
longclawed
fingers
touched
her
it
was
real
it
could
kill
her
as
it
had
killed
the
children
the
grackles
know
your
real
nam
she
screamed
at
it
suddenly
it
recoiled
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
for
a
moment
the
grin
on
the
lips
inside
the
great
red
grin
that
had
been
painted
on
and
around
them
became
a
grimace
of
hate
and
pain
and
perhaps
of
fear
as
well
it
might
only
have
been
her
imagination
ad
she
certainly
had
no
idea
why
she
had
said
such
a
crazy
thing
but
it
bought
her
an
instant
of
time
she
was
on
her
feet
and
running
brakes
squealed
and
a
hoarse
voice
both
mad
and
scared
yelled
why
don't
you
look
where
you're
going
you
dumb
quiff
she
had
a
blurred
impression
of
the
bakery
truck
that
had
almost
hit
her
when
she
bolted
into
the
street
like
a
child
after
a
rubber
ball
and
then
she
was
standing
on
the
opposite
sidewalk
panting
a
hot
stitch
in
her
left
side
the
bakery
truck
went
on
down
lower
main
the
clown
was
gone
the
leg
was
gone
the
house
still
stood
there
but
she
saw
now
that
it
was
crumbling
and
deserted
the
windows
boarded
up
the
steps
leading
up
to
the
porch
cracked
and
broken
was
i
really
in
there
or
did
i
dream
it
all
but
her
jeans
were
dirty
her
yellow
blouse
smeared
with
dust
and
there
was
chocolate
on
her
fingers
she
rubbed
them
on
the
legs
of
her
jeans
and
walked
away
fast
her
face
hot
her
back
cold
as
ice
her
eyeballs
seeming
to
pulse
in
and
out
with
the
rapid
thud
of
her
heart
we
can't
beat
it
whatever
it
is
we
can't
beat
it
it
even
wants
us
to
try
it
wants
to
settle
the
old
score
can't
be
happy
with
a
draw
i
guess
we
ought
to
get
out
of
here
just
leave
something
brushed
against
her
calf
light
as
a
cat
questing
paw
she
jerked
away
from
it
with
a
little
shriek
she
looked
down
and
cringed
one
hand
against
her
mouth
it
was
a
balloon
as
yellow
as
her
blouse
written
on
the
side
of
it
in
electric
blue
were
the
words
that
wight
wabbit
as
she
watched
it
went
bouncing
lightly
up
the
street
urged
by
the
pleasant
late
spring
breeze
richie
tozier
makes
tracks
well
there
was
the
day
henry
and
his
friends
chased
me
before
the
end
of
school
this
was
richie
was
walking
along
outer
canal
street
past
bassey
park
now
he
stopped
hands
stuffed
in
his
pockets
looking
toward
the
.kissing
bridge
but
not
really
seeing
it
i
got
away
from
them
in
the
toy
department
of
freese
since
the
mad
conclusion
of
the
reunion
lunch
he
had
been
walking
aimlessly
trying
to
make
his
peace
with
the
awful
things
which
had
been
in
the
fortune
cookies
or
the
things
which
had
seemed
to
be
in
the
cookies
he
thought
that
most
likely
nothing
at
all
had
come
out
of
them
it
had
been
a
group
hallucination
brought
on
by
all
the
spooky
shit
they
had
been
talking
about
the
best
proof
of
the
hypothesis
was
that
rose
had
seen
nothing
at
all
of
course
beverly
parents
had
never
seen
any
of
the
blood
that
came
out
of
the
bathroom
drain
either
but
this
wasn't
the
same
no
why
not
because
we're
grownups
no
he
muttered
and
discovered
the
thought
had
absolutely
no
power
or
logic
at
all
it
might
as
well
have
been
a
nonsense
line
from
a
kid
skiprope
chant
he
started
to
walk
again
i
went
up
by
city
center
and
sat
down
on
a
park
bench
for
awhile
and
i
thought
i
saw
he
stopped
again
frowning
saw
what
but
that
was
just
something
i
dreamed
was
it
was
it
really
he
looked
to
the
left
and
saw
the
big
glassbrickandsteel
building
that
had
looked
so
modern
in
the
late
fifties
and
now
looked
rather
antique
and
tacky
and
here
i
am
he
thought
right
back
to
fucking
city
center
scene
of
that
other
hallucination
or
dream
or
whatever
it
was
the
others
saw
him
as
the
klass
klown
the
krazy
kutup
and
he
had
fallen
neatly
and
easily
into
that
role
again
ah
we
all
fell
neatly
and
easily
back
into
our
old
roles
again
didn't
you
notice
but
was
there
anything
very
unusual
about
that
he
thought
you
would
probably
see
much
the
same
thing
at
any
tenth
or
twentieth
high
school
reunion
the
class
comedian
who
had
discovered
a
vocation
for
the
priesthood
in
college
would
after
two
drinks
revert
almost
automatically
to
the
wiseacre
he
had
been
the
great
english
brain
who
had
wound
up
with
a
gm
truck
dealership
would
suddenly
begin
spouting
off
about
john
irving
or
john
cheever
the
guy
who
had
played
with
the
moondogs
on
saturday
nights
and
who
had
gone
on
to
become
a
mathematics
professor
at
cornell
would
suddenly
find
himself
on
stage
with
the
band
a
fender
guitar
strapped
over
his
shoulder
whopping
out
gloria
or
surfin
bird
with
gleeful
drunken
ferocity
what
was
it
springsteen
said
no
retreat
baby
no
surrender
but
it
was
easier
to
believe
in
the
oldies
on
the
recordplayer
after
a
couple
of
drinks
or
some
pretty
good
panama
red
but
richie
believed
it
was
the
reversion
that
was
the
hallucination
not
the
present
life
maybe
the
child
was
the
father
of
the
man
but
fathers
and
sons
often
shared
very
different
interests
and
only
a
passing
resemblance
they
but
you
say
grownups
and
now
it
sounds
like
nonsense
it
sounds
like
so
much
bibble
babble
why
is
that
richie
why
because
derry
is
as
weird
as
ever
why
don't
we
just
leave
it
at
that
because
things
weren't
that
simple
that
was
why
as
a
kid
he
had
been
a
goofoff
a
sometimes
vulgar
sometimes
amusing
comedian
because
it
was
one
way
to
get
along
without
getting
killed
by
kids
like
henry
bowers
or
going
absolutely
loonytunes
with
boredom
and
loneliness
he
realized
now
that
a
lot
of
the
problem
had
been
his
own
mind
which
was
usually
moving
at
a
speed
ten
or
twenty
times
that
of
his
chssmates
they
had
thought
him
strange
weird
or
even
suicidal
depending
on
the
escapade
in
question
but
maybe
it
had
been
a
simple
case
of
mental
overdrive
if
anything
about
being
in
constant
mental
overdrive
was
simple
anyway
it
was
the
sort
d
thing
you
got
under
control
after
awhile
you
got
it
under
control
or
you
found
outlets
for
it
guys
like
kinky
briefcase
or
buford
kissdrivel
for
instance
richie
had
discovered
that
in
the
months
after
he
had
wandered
into
the
college
radio
station
pretty
much
on
a
whim
and
had
discovered
everything
he
had
ever
wanted
during
his
first
week
behind
the
microphone
he
hadn't
been
very
good
at
first
he
had
been
too
excited
to
be
good
but
he
had
understood
his
potential
not
to
be
just
good
at
the
job
but
great
at
it
and
just
that
knowledge
had
been
enough
to
put
him
over
the
moon
on
a
cloud
of
euphoria
at
the
same
time
he
had
begun
to
understand
the
great
principle
that
moved
the
universe
at
least
that
part
of
the
universe
which
had
to
do
with
careers
and
success
you
found
the
crazy
guy
who
was
running
around
inside
of
you
fucking
up
your
life
you
chased
him
into
a
corner
and
grabbed
him
but
you
didn't
kill
him
oh
no
killing
was
too
good
for
the
likes
of
that
little
bastard
you
put
a
harness
over
his
head
and
then
started
plowing
the
crazy
guy
worked
like
a
demon
once
you
had
him
in
the
traces
and
he
supplied
you
with
a
few
chucks
from
time
to
tune
that
was
really
all
there
was
and
that
was
enough
he
had
been
funny
all
right
a
laugh
a
minute
but
in
the
end
he
had
outgrown
the
nightmares
that
were
on
the
dark
side
of
all
those
laughs
or
he
thought
he
had
until
today
when
the
word
grownup
suddenly
stopped
making
sense
to
his
own
ears
and
now
here
was
something
else
to
cope
with
or
at
least
think
about
here
was
the
huge
and
totally
idiotic
statue
of
paul
bunyan
in
front
of
city
center
i
must
be
the
exception
that
proves
the
rule
big
bill
are
you
sure
there
was
nothing
richie
nothing
at
all
up
by
city
center...i
thought
i
saw
sharp
pain
needled
at
his
eyes
for
the
second
time
that
day
and
he
clutched
at
them
a
startled
moan
coming
out
of
him
then
it
was
gone
again
as
quickly
as
it
had
come
but
he
had
also
smelled
something
hadn't
he
something
that
wasn't
really
there
but
something
that
had
been
there
something
that
made
him
think
of
i'm
right
here
with
you
richie
hold
my
hand
can
you
catch
hold
mike
hanlon
it
was
smoke
that
had
made
his
eyes
sting
and
water
twentyseven
years
ago
they
had
breathed
that
smoke
in
the
end
there
had
just
been
mike
and
himself
left
and
they
had
seen
but
it
was
gone
he
took
a
step
closer
to
the
plastic
paul
bunyan
statue
as
amazed
by
its
cheerful
vulgarity
now
as
he
had
been
overwhelmed
by
its
size
as
a
child
the
mythical
paul
stood
twenty
feet
high
and
the
base
added
another
six
feet
he
stood
smiling
down
at
the
car
and
pedestrian
traffic
on
outer
canal
street
from
the
edge
of
the
city
center
lawn
city
center
had
been
erected
in
the
years
for
a
minorleague
basketball
team
that
had
never
materialized
the
derry
city
council
had
voted
money
for
the
statue
a
year
later
in
i
had
been
hotly
debated
both
in
the
council
public
meetings
and
in
the
letterstotheeditor
columns
of
the
derry
news
many
thought
it
would
be
a
perfectly
lovely
statue
certain
to
become
a
tourist
attraction
of
note
there
were
others
who
found
the
idea
of
a
plastic
paul
bunyan
horrible
garish
and
unbelievably
gauche
the
art
teacher
at
derry
high
school
richie
remembered
had
written
a
letter
to
the
news
saying
that
if
such
a
monstrosity
were
actually
to
be
erected
in
derry
she
would
blow
it
up
grinning
richie
wondered
if
that
babe
contract
had
been
renewed
the
controversy
which
richie
recognized
now
as
an
utterly
typical
bigtown/smallcity
tempest
in
a
teapot
had
raged
for
six
months
and
of
course
it
had
been
entirely
meaningless
the
statue
had
been
purchased
and
even
if
the
city
council
had
done
something
as
aberrant
especially
for
new
england
as
deciding
not
to
use
an
item
for
which
money
had
been
paid
where
in
god
name
could
it
have
been
stored
then
the
statue
not
really
sculpted
at
all
but
simply
cast
in
some
ohio
plastics
plant
had
been
set
in
place
still
shrouded
in
a
whack
of
canvas
big
enough
to
serve
as
a
clippership
sail
it
had
been
unveiled
on
may
th
which
was
the
incorporated
township
onehundredandfiftieth
birthday
one
faction
gave
voice
to
predictable
moans
of
outrage
the
other
to
equally
predictable
moans
of
rapture
when
paul
was
revealed
that
day
he
was
wearing
his
bib
overalls
and
a
redandwhite
checked
shirt
his
beard
was
splendidly
black
splendidly
full
splendidly
lumber
jacky
a
plastic
axe
surely
the
godzilla
of
all
plastic
axes
was
slung
over
one
shoulder
and
he
grinned
unceasingly
at
the
northern
skies
which
on
the
day
of
the
unveiling
had
been
as
blue
as
the
skin
of
paul
reputed
companion
babe
was
not
present
at
the
unveiling
however
the
cost
estimate
of
adding
a
blue
ox
to
the
tableau
had
been
prohibitive
the
children
who
attended
the
ceremonies
there
were
hundreds
of
them
and
tenyearold
richie
tozier
in
the
company
of
his
dad
had
been
among
them
were
totally
and
uncritically
delighted
by
the
plastic
giant
parents
boosted
toddlers
up
onto
the
square
pedestal
on
which
paul
stood
took
photos
and
then
watched
with
mixed
apprehension
and
amusement
as
the
kids
climbed
and
crawled
laughing
over
paul
huge
black
boots
correction
huge
black
plastic
boots
it
had
been
march
of
the
following
year
when
richie
exhausted
and
terrified
had
finished
up
on
one
of
the
benches
in
front
of
the
statue
after
eluding
by
the
barest
of
margins
messrs
bowers
criss
and
huggins
in
a
chase
that
had
led
from
derry
elementary
school
across
most
of
the
downtown
area
he
had
finally
ditched
them
in
the
toy
department
of
freese
department
store
the
derry
branch
of
freese
was
a
poor
thing
compared
with
the
grand
downtown
department
store
in
bangor
but
richie
had
been
far
past
caring
about
such
things
by
then
it
was
a
case
of
any
port
in
a
storm
henry
bowers
had
been
right
behind
him
and
by
then
richie
had
been
flagging
badly
he
had
dodged
into
the
mouth
of
the
department
store
revolving
door
as
a
last
resort
henry
who
apparently
didn't
understand
the
physics
of
such
devices
had
nearly
lost
the
tips
of
his
fingers
trying
to
grab
richie
as
richie
trundled
around
and
into
the
store
pelting
downstairs
shirttail
flying
out
behind
him
he
had
heard
the
revolving
door
give
off
a
series
of
reports
almost
as
loud
as
tv
gunfire
and
understood
that
larry
moe
and
curly
were
still
after
him
he
was
laughing
as
he
went
down
the
stairs
to
the
basement
level
but
that
was
only
a
nervous
tic
he
was
as
full
of
terror
as
a
rabbit
caught
in
a
wire
snare
they
really
meant
to
beat
him
up
good
this
time
he
had
no
idea
that
in
another
ten
weeks
or
so
he
would
believe
the
three
of
them
henry
in
particular
capable
of
anything
short
of
murder
and
he
surely
would
have
whitened
with
shock
if
he
had
known
of
the
apocalyptic
rockfight
in
july
when
even
that
last
qualification
would
disappear
from
his
mind
and
the
whole
thing
had
been
so
utterly
typically
stupid
richie
and
the
other
boys
in
his
fifth
grade
class
had
been
filing
into
the
gym
a
sixth
grade
class
henry
hulking
among
them
like
an
ox
among
cows
had
been
coming
out
although
he
was
still
in
the
fifth
grade
henry
went
to
gym
with
the
older
boys
the
overhead
pipes
had
been
dripping
again
and
mr
fazio
hadn't
yet
gotten
around
to
putting
up
his
caution
wet
floor
sign
on
its
little
easel
henry
had
slipped
in
a
puddle
and
had
landed
on
his
keister
before
he
could
stop
it
richie
traitor
mouth
had
bugled
way
to
go
bananaheel
there
had
been
an
explosion
of
laughter
from
both
henry
classmates
and
richie
but
there
had
been
no
laughter
on
henry
face
as
he
picked
himself
up
only
a
dull
flush
the
color
of
freshly
fired
brick
later
for
you
foureye
he
said
and
walked
on
the
laughter
died
at
once
the
boys
in
the
hall
looked
at
richie
as
one
already
dead
henry
did
not
pause
to
check
reactions
he
simply
walked
off
head
down
elbows
red
from
catching
the
fall
a
large
wet
place
on
the
seat
of
his
pants
looking
at
that
wet
spot
richie
felt
his
suicidally
witty
mouth
drop
open
again
but
this
time
he
snapped
it
shut
again
so
fast
he
almost
amputated
the
tip
of
his
tongue
with
the
falling
gate
of
his
teeth
well
but
he'll
forget
he
told
himself
uneasily
as
he
changed
up
for
gym
sure
he
will
ole
hank
just
hasn't
got
that
many
memory
circuits
working
every
time
he
takes
a
shit
he
probably
has
to
look
up
the
directions
in
the
instruction
booklet
haha
haha
you're
dead
trashmout
vince
booger
taliendo
told
him
pulling
his
jock
up
over
a
dork
roughly
the
size
and
shape
of
an
anemic
peanut
he
said
it
with
a
certain
sad
respect
don't
worry
though
i'll
bring
flowers
cut
off
your
ears
and
bring
cauliflowers
richie
had
come
back
smartly
and
everyone
laughed
even
ole
booger
taliendo
laughed
why
not
they
could
all
afford
to
laugh
what
me
worry
they
would
all
be
home
watching
jimmy
dodd
and
the
mouseketeers
on
the
mickey
mouse
club
or
frankie
lymon
singing
tm
not
a
juvenile
delinquert
on
american
bandstand
while
richie
went
shagging
ass
through
ladies
lingerie
and
housewares
on
his
way
to
the
toy
department
with
sweat
pouring
down
his
back
into
the
crack
of
his
ass
and
his
terrified
balls
strung
up
so
high
they
felt
like
they
might
be
hung
over
his
bellybutton
sure
they
could
laugh
hardeharhar
har
henry
hadn't
forgotten
richie
had
left
by
the
door
at
the
kindergarten
end
of
the
school
building
just
in
case
but
henry
had
stuck
belch
huggins
there
also
just
in
case
hardehar
harhar
richie
saw
belch
first
or
there
would
have
been
no
contest
at
all
belch
was
looking
out
toward
derry
park
holding
an
unlit
cigarette
in
one
hand
and
dreamily
picking
the
seat
of
his
chinos
out
of
his
ass
with
the
other
heart
pounding
hard
richie
had
walked
quietly
across
the
playground
and
was
most
of
the
way
down
charter
street
before
belch
turned
his
head
and
saw
him
he
yelled
for
henry
and
victor
and
since
then
the
chase
had
been
on
when
richie
reached
the
toy
department
it
had
been
utterly
horribly
deserted
there
wasn't
even
a
sales
clerk
hanging
out
a
welcome
adult
to
put
a
stop
to
things
before
they
got
entirely
out
of
hand
he
could
hear
the
three
dinosaurs
of
the
apocalypse
closing
in
now
and
he
simply
couldn't
run
anymore
each
breath
produced
a
deep
hurting
stitch
in
his
left
side
his
eye
fixed
on
a
door
which
read
emergency
exit
onla
alarm
will
sound
hope
kindled
in
his
chest
richie
ran
down
an
aisle
crammed
with
donald
duck
jackintheboxes
united
states
army
tanks
made
in
japan
lone
ranger
cap
pistols
windup
robots
he
reached
the
door
and
slammed
the
pushbar
as
hard
as
he
could
the
door
opened
letting
in
cool
midmarch
air
the
alarm
went
off
with
a
strident
bray
richie
immediately
doubled
back
and
dropped
to
his
hands
and
knees
in
the
next
aisle
over
he
was
down
before
the
door
could
settle
closed
again
henry
belch
and
victor
thundered
into
the
toy
department
just
as
the
door
clicked
shut
and
the
alarm
cut
off
they
raced
for
it
henry
in
the
lead
his
face
set
and
intent
a
sales
clerk
finally
appeared
coming
on
the
run
he
wore
a
blue
nylon
duster
over
a
plaid
sportcoat
of
excruciating
ugliness
the
rims
of
his
spectacles
were
as
pink
as
the
eyes
of
a
white
rabbit
richie
thought
he
looked
like
wally
cox
in
his
mr
peepers
role
and
he
had
to
slam
his
traitor
mouth
into
the
fat
part
of
his
forearm
to
keep
from
screaming
out
gales
of
exhausted
laughter
you
boys
mr
peepers
exclaimed
you
boys
can't
go
out
there
that
an
emergency
exit
you
hey
you
boy
victor
glanced
at
him
a
little
nervously
but
henry
and
belch
never
turned
from
their
course
and
victor
followed
them
the
alarm
brayed
again
longer
this
time
as
they
charged
into
the
alley
before
it
stopped
clanging
richie
was
on
his
feet
and
trotting
back
toward
ladie
lingerie
you
boys
will
be
barred
from
the
store
the
clerk
yelled
after
him
looking
back
over
his
shoulder
richie
squealed
in
his
granny
grunt
voice
did
anyone
ever
tell
you
you
look
just
like
mr
peepers
young
man
and
so
he
had
escaped
and
so
he
had
finished
up
almost
a
mile
from
freese
in
front
of
city
center
and
he
devoutly
hoped
out
of
harm
way
at
least
for
the
time
being
he
was
spent
he
sat
down
on
a
bench
just
to
the
left
of
the
paul
bunyan
statue
wanting
only
a
little
peace
while
he
got
himself
back
together
in
a
bit
he
would
get
up
and
head
home
but
for
now
it
felt
too
good
to
just
sit
here
in
the
afternoon
sun
the
day
had
opened
in
a
cold
drizzly
gloom
but
now
you
could
believe
spring
might
actually
be
on
the
way
farther
up
the
lawn
he
could
see
the
city
center
marquee
which
on
that
march
day
bore
this
message
in
large
blue
translucent
letters
hey
teens
coming
march
th
the
arnie
woo
woo
ginsberg
rock
and
roll
show
jerry
lee
lewis
the
penguins
frankie
lymon
and
the
teenagers
gene
vincent
and
the
blue
caps
freddy
boom
boom
cannon
an
evening
of
wholesome
entertainment
that
was
a
show
richie
really
wanted
to
see
but
he
knew
there
wasn't
a
chance
his
mother
idea
of
wholesome
entertainment
did
not
include
jerry
lee
lewis
telling
the
young
people
of
america
we
got
chicken
in
the
barn
whose
barn
what
barn
my
barn
nor
for
that
matter
did
it
include
freddy
cannon
whose
tallahassee
lassie
had
a
hifi
chassis
she
was
willing
to
admit
that
she
had
done
her
share
of
screaming
for
frank
sinatra
whom
she
now
called
frankie
the
snot
as
a
bobbysoxer
but
like
bill
denbrough
mother
she
was
death
on
rock
and
roll
chuck
berry
terrified
her
and
she
declared
that
richard
penniman
better
known
to
his
teen
and
subteen
constituency
as
little
richard
made
her
want
to
barf
like
a
chicken
this
was
a
phrase
for
which
richie
had
never
asked
a
translation
his
dad
was
neutral
on
the
subject
of
rock
and
roll
and
could
perhaps
have
been
swayed
but
richie
knew
in
his
heart
that
his
mother
wishes
would
rule
on
this
subject
until
he
was
sixteen
or
seventeen
anyway
and
by
then
his
mother
was
firmly
convinced
the
country
rock
and
roll
mania
would
have
passed
richie
thought
danny
and
the
juniors
were
more
right
on
that
subject
than
his
mom
rock
and
roll
would
never
die
he
himself
loved
it
although
his
sources
were
really
only
two
american
bandstand
on
channel
in
the
afternoon
and
wmex
out
of
boston
at
night
when
the
air
had
thinned
and
the
hoarse
enthusiastic
voice
of
amie
ginsberg
came
wavering
in
and
out
like
the
voice
of
a
ghost
called
up
at
a
seance
the
beat
did
more
than
make
him
happy
it
made
him
feel
bigger
stronger
more
there
when
frankie
ford
sang
sea
cruise
or
eddie
cochran
sang
summertime
blues
richie
was
actually
transported
with
joy
there
was
power
in
that
music
a
power
which
seemed
to
most
rightfully
belong
to
all
the
skinny
kids
fat
kids
ugly
kids
shy
kids
the
world
losers
in
short
in
it
he
felt
a
mad
hilarious
voltage
which
had
the
power
to
both
kill
and
exalt
he
idolized
fats
domino
who
made
even
ben
hanscom
look
sum
and
trim
and
buddy
holly
who
like
richie
wore
glasses
and
screaming
jay
hawkins
who
popped
out
of
a
coffin
at
his
concerts
or
so
richie
had
been
told
and
the
dovells
who
danced
as
good
as
black
guys
well
almost
he
would
have
his
rock
and
roll
someday
if
he
wanted
it
he
was
confident
it
would
still
be
there
for
him
when
his
mother
finally
gave
in
and
let
him
have
it
but
that
would
not
be
on
march
th
or
in
...or
his
eyes
had
drifted
away
from
the
marquee
and
then
well
then
he
must
have
fallen
asleep
it
was
the
only
explanation
that
made
sense
what
had
happened
next
could
only
happen
in
dreams
and
now
here
he
was
again
a
richie
tozier
who
had
finally
gotten
all
the
rock
and
roll
he
had
ever
wanted
and
who
had
found
happily
that
it
still
wasn't
enough
his
eyes
went
to
the
marquee
in
front
of
city
center
and
saw
that
with
a
hideous
kind
of
serendipity
those
same
blue
letters
spelled
out
june
th
heavy
metal
mania
judas
priest
iron
maiden
buy
your
tickets
here
or
at
any
ticketron
outlet
somewhere
along
the
way
they
dropped
the
wholesome
entertainment
line
thought
richie
but
as
far
as
i
can
tell
that
just
about
the
only
difference
and
heard
danny
and
the
juniors
dim
and
distant
like
voices
heard
down
a
long
corridor
coming
out
of
a
cheap
radio
rock
and
roll
will
never
die
i'll
dig
it
to
the
end
it'll
go
down
in
history
just
you
watch
my
friend
richie
looked
back
at
paul
bunyan
patron
saint
of
derry
derry
which
had
come
into
being
according
to
the
stories
because
this
was
where
the
logs
fetched
up
when
they
came
downriver
there
had
been
a
time
when
in
the
spring
both
the
penobscot
and
the
kenduskeag
would
have
been
solid
logs
from
one
side
to
the
other
their
black
bark
hides
glistening
in
the
spring
sun
a
fellow
who
was
fast
on
his
feet
could
walk
from
wally
spa
in
hell
half
acre
over
to
ramper
in
brewster
ramper
was
a
tavern
of
such
horrible
repute
that
it
was
commonly
called
the
bucket
of
blood
without
getting
his
boots
wet
over
the
third
crossing
of
his
rawhide
laces
or
so
it
had
been
storied
in
richie
youth
and
he
supposed
there
was
a
bit
of
paul
bunyan
in
all
such
stories
old
paul
he
thought
looking
up
at
the
plastic
statue
what
you
been
doing
since
i've
been
gone
made
any
new
riverbeds
coming
home
tired
and
dragging
your
axe
behind
you
made
any
new
lakes
on
account
of
wanting
a
bathtub
big
enough
so
you
could
sit
in
water
up
to
your
neck
scared
any
more
little
kids
the
way
you
scared
me
that
day
ah
and
suddenly
he
remembered
it
all
the
way
you
will
sometimes
suddenly
remember
a
word
which
has
been
dancing
on
the
tip
of
your
tongue
there
he
had
been
sitting
in
that
mellow
march
sunshine
drowsing
a
little
thinking
about
going
home
and
catching
the
last
half
hour
of
bandstand
and
suddenly
there
had
been
a
warm
swash
of
air
into
his
face
it
blew
his
hair
back
from
his
forehead
he
looked
up
and
paul
bunyan
huge
plastic
face
had
been
right
in
front
of
his
bigger
than
a
face
on
a
movie
screen
filling
everything
the
rush
of
air
had
been
caused
by
paul
bending
down
although
he
did
not
precisely
look
like
paul
anymore
the
forehead
was
now
low
and
beetling
tufts
of
wiry
hair
poked
from
a
nose
as
red
as
the
nose
of
a
longtime
drunkard
his
eyes
were
bloodshot
and
one
had
a
slight
cast
to
it
the
axe
was
no
longer
on
his
shoulder
paul
was
leaning
on
its
haft
and
the
blunt
end
of
its
head
had
crushed
a
trench
in
the
concrete
of
the
sidewalk
he
was
still
grinning
but
there
was
nothing
cheery
about
it
now
from
between
gigantic
yellow
teeth
there
drifted
a
smell
like
small
animals
rotting
in
hot
underbrush
tm
going
to
eat
you
up
the
giant
had
said
in
a
low
rumbling
voice
it
was
the
sound
of
boulders
rocking
against
each
other
during
an
earthquake
unless
you
give
me
back
my
hen
and
my
harp
and
my
bags
of
gold
i'm
going
to
eat
you
right
the
fuck
up
the
breath
of
these
words
made
richie
shirt
flutter
and
flap
like
a
sail
in
a
hurricane
he
shrank
back
against
the
bench
eyes
bugging
hair
standing
out
to
all
sides
like
quills
wrapped
in
a
pocket
of
carriomstink
the
giant
began
to
laugh
it
settled
its
hands
on
the
haft
of
its
axe
the
way
ted
williams
might
have
laid
hold
of
his
favorite
baseball
bat
or
ashhandle
if
you
prefer
and
pulled
it
out
of
the
hole
it
had
made
in
the
sidewalk
the
axe
began
to
rise
into
the
air
it
made
a
low
lethal
rushing
sound
richie
suddenly
understood
that
the
giant
meant
to
split
him
right
down
the
middle
but
he
felt
that
he
could
not
move
a
logy
sort
of
apathy
had
stolen
over
him
what
did
it
matter
he
was
dozing
having
a
dream
any
moment
now
some
driver
would
blow
his
horn
at
a
kid
running
across
the
street
and
he
would
wake
up
that
right
the
giant
had
rumbled
you'll
wake
up
in
hell
and
at
the
last
instant
as
the
axe
slowed
to
its
apogee
and
balanced
there
richie
understood
that
this
wasn't
a
dream
at
all
and
if
it
was
it
was
a
dream
that
could
kill
trying
to
scream
but
making
no
sound
at
all
he
rolled
off
the
bench
and
onto
the
raked
gravel
plot
which
surrounded
what
had
been
a
statue
and
was
now
only
a
base
with
two
huge
steel
bolts
sticking
out
of
it
where
the
feet
had
been
the
sound
of
the
descending
axe
filled
the
world
with
its
pressing
insistent
whisper
the
giant
grin
had
become
a
murderer
grimace
its
lips
had
pulled
back
so
far
from
its
teeth
that
its
plastic
red
gums
hideously
red
gleamed
the
blade
of
the
axe
struck
the
bench
where
richie
had
been
only
an
instant
before
the
edge
was
so
sharp
that
there
was
almost
no
sound
at
all
but
the
bench
was
sheared
instantly
in
two
the
halves
sagged
away
from
each
other
the
wood
inside
the
green
painted
skin
a
bright
and
somehow
sickening
white
richie
was
on
his
back
still
trying
to
scream
he
pushed
himself
with
his
heels
gravel
went
down
the
collar
of
his
shirt
down
the
back
of
his
pants
and
there
was
paul
towering
above
him
looking
down
at
him
with
eyes
the
size
of
manhole
covers
there
was
paul
looking
down
at
one
small
boy
cowering
on
the
gravel
the
giant
took
a
step
toward
him
richie
felt
the
ground
shudder
when
the
black
boot
came
down
gravel
spumed
up
in
a
cloud
richie
rolled
over
onto
his
stomach
and
staggered
to
his
feet
his
legs
were
already
trying
to
run
before
he
was
balanced
and
as
a
result
he
fell
flat
on
his
belly
again
he
heard
the
wind
whoof
out
of
his
lungs
his
hair
fell
in
his
eyes
he
could
see
the
traffic
going
back
and
forth
on
canal
and
main
streets
as
it
did
every
day
as
if
nothing
was
happening
as
if
no
one
in
any
of
those
cars
could
see
or
care
that
paul
bunyan
had
come
to
life
and
stepped
down
from
its
pedestal
in
order
to
commit
murder
with
an
axe
roughly
the
size
of
a
deluxe
motor
home
the
sunshine
was
blotted
out
richie
lay
in
a
patch
of
shade
that
looked
like
a
man
he
scrambled
to
his
knees
almost
fell
over
sideways
managed
to
get
to
his
feet
and
ran
as
fast
as
he
could
he
ran
with
his
knees
popping
almost
all
the
way
up
to
his
chest
and
his
elbows
pistoning
behind
him
he
could
hear
that
awful
persistent
whisper
building
again
a
sound
that
seemed
to
be
not
really
sound
at
all
but
pressure
on
the
skin
and
eardrums
swiiipppppp
the
earth
shook
richie
upper
and
lower
teeth
rattled
against
each
other
like
china
plates
in
an
earthquake
he
did
not
have
to
look
to
know
that
paul
axe
had
buried
itself
haftdeep
in
the
sidewalk
inches
behind
his
feet
madly
in
his
mind
he
heard
the
dovells
oh
the
kids
in
bristol
are
sharp
as
a
pistol
when
they
do
the
bristol
stomp
he
passed
out
of
the
giant
shadow
into
sunlight
again
and
as
he
did
he
began
to
laugh
the
same
exhausted
laughter
that
had
come
from
him
when
he
bolted
downstairs
in
freese
panting
that
hot
stitch
in
his
side
again
he
had
at
last
risked
a
glance
back
over
his
shoulder
there
was
the
statue
of
paul
bunyan
standing
on
its
pedestal
where
it
always
stood
axe
on
its
shoulder
head
cocked
toward
the
sky
lips
parted
in
the
eternal
optimistic
grin
of
the
mythhero
the
bench
which
had
been
sheared
in
two
was
whole
and
intact
thank
you
very
much
the
gravel
where
tall
paul
he'sa
my
all
annette
funicello
sang
maniacally
in
richie
head
had
planted
his
huge
foot
was
raked
and
immaculate
except
for
the
scuffed
spot
where
riche
had
fallen
off
while
he
was
getting
away
from
the
giant
dreaming
there
was
no
footprint
no
axeslash
in
the
concrete
there
was
nothing
here
but
a
boy
who
had
been
chased
by
other
boys
bigger
boys
and
so
had
had
himself
a
very
small
but
very
potent
dream
about
a
homicidal
colossus
the
giant
economysize
henry
bowers
if
you
pleased
shit
richie
said
in
a
tiny
wavering
voice
and
then
uttered
an
uncertain
laugh
he
stood
there
awhile
longer
waiting
to
see
if
the
statue
would
move
again
perhaps
wink
perhaps
shift
its
axe
from
one
shoulder
to
the
other
perhaps
come
down
and
have
at
him
again
but
of
course
none
of
those
things
happened
of
course
what
me
worry
hardeharharhar
a
doze
a
dream
no
more
than
that
but
as
abraham
lincoln
or
socrates
or
someone
like
that
had
once
observed
enough
was
enough
it
was
time
to
go
home
and
cool
out
to
make
like
kookie
on
sunset
strip
and
just
lay
chilly
and
although
it
would
have
been
quicker
to
cut
through
the
city
center
grounds
he
decided
not
to
he
didn't
want
to
get
close
to
that
statue
again
so
he
had
gone
the
long
way
around
and
by
that
evening
he
had
nearly
forgotten
the
incident
until
now
here
sits
a
man
he
thought
here
sits
a
man
dressed
in
a
mossygreen
sportcoat
purchased
at
one
of
the
best
shops
on
rodeo
drive
here
sits
a
man
with
bass
weejuns
on
his
feet
and
calvin
klein
underwear
to
cover
his
ass
here
sits
a
man
with
soft
contact
lenses
resting
easily
on
his
eyes
here
sits
a
man
remembering
the
dream
of
a
boy
who
thought
an
ivy
league
shin
with
a
fruitloop
on
the
back
and
a
pair
of
snap
jack
shoes
was
the
height
of
fashion
here
sits
a
grownup
looking
at
the
same
old
statue
and
hey
paul
tall
paul
i'm
here
to
say
youre
the
same
in
every
way
you
ain't
aged
a
motherfucking
day
the
old
explanation
still
rang
true
in
his
mind
a
dream
he
supposed
he
could
believe
in
monsters
if
he
had
to
monsters
were
no
big
deal
hadn't
he
sat
in
radio
studios
at
one
time
or
another
reading
news
copy
about
such
fellows
as
idi
amin
dada
and
jim
jones
and
that
guy
who
had
blown
away
all
those
folks
in
a
mcdonald
just
down
the
road
apiece
shitfire
and
save
matches
monsters
were
cheap
who
needed
a
fivebuck
movie
ticket
when
you
could
read
about
them
in
the
paper
for
thirtyfive
cents
or
hear
about
them
on
the
radio
for
free
and
he
supposed
if
he
could
believe
in
the
jim
jones
variety
he
could
believe
in
mike
hanlon
version
at
least
for
awhile
it
even
had
its
own
sorry
charm
because
it
came
from
outside
and
no
one
had
to
claim
responsibility
for
it
he
could
believe
in
a
monster
that
had
as
many
faces
as
there
are
rubber
masks
in
a
novelty
shop
if
you're
gonna
have
one
you
might
as
well
have
a
pack
of
em
he
thought
cheaper
by
the
dozen
right
gang
at
least
for
the
sake
of
argument
but
a
thirtyfoot
high
plastic
statue
that
stepped
off
its
pedestal
and
then
tried
to
carve
you
up
with
its
plastic
axe
that
was
just
a
little
too
ripe
as
abraham
lincoln
or
socrates
or
someone
had
also
said
i'll
eat
fish
and
i'll
eat
meat
but
there
is
some
shit
i
will
not
eat
it
just
wasn't
that
sharp
needling
pain
struck
his
eyes
again
without
warning
jerking
a
dismayed
cry
from
him
this
was
the
worst
yet
going
deeper
and
lasting
longer
scaring
the
bejesus
out
of
him
he
clapped
his
hands
to
his
eyes
and
then
groped
instinctively
for
the
bottom
lids
with
his
forefingers
meaning
to
pop
his
contacts
out
it
maybe
some
kind
of
infection
he
thought
dimly
but
jesus
it
hurts
he
pulled
the
lids
down
and
was
ready
to
give
the
single
practiced
blink
that
would
send
them
tumbling
out
and
he
would
spend
the
next
fifteen
minutes
grovelling
myopically
for
them
in
the
gravel
surrounding
the
bench
but
jesus
god
who
gave
a
shit
right
now
it
felt
like
there
were
nails
in
his
eyes
when
the
pain
disappeared
it
did
not
dwindle
it
just
went
one
moment
there
the
next
moment
gone
his
eyes
teared
briefly
and
then
stopped
he
lowered
his
hands
slowly
his
heart
running
fast
in
his
chest
ready
to
blink
them
out
the
instant
the
pain
started
again
it
didn't
and
suddenly
he
found
himself
thinking
about
the
only
horror
movie
that
had
ever
really
scared
him
as
a
kid
possibly
because
he
had
taken
so
much
shit
about
his
glasses
and
had
spent
so
much
time
thinking
about
his
eyes
that
movie
had
been
the
crawling
eye
with
forrest
tucker
not
very
good
the
other
kids
had
laughed
themselves
into
hysterics
over
it
but
richie
had
not
laughed
richie
had
been
rendered
cold
and
white
and
dumb
for
once
with
not
a
single
voice
to
command
as
that
gelatinous
tentacled
eye
came
out
of
the
manufactured
fog
of
some
english
movie
set
waving
its
fibrous
tentacles
in
front
of
it
the
sight
of
that
eye
had
been
very
bad
the
embodiment
of
a
hundred
notquiterealized
fears
and
disquiets
on
some
night
not
long
after
he
had
dreamed
of
looking
at
himself
in
a
mirror
and
bringing
a
large
pin
up
and
sticking
it
slowly
into
the
black
iris
of
his
eye
and
feeling
a
numb
watery
springiness
as
the
bottom
of
his
eye
filled
up
with
blood
he
remembered
now
he
remembered
waking
up
and
discovering
that
he
had
wet
the
bed
the
best
indicator
of
how
gruesome
that
dream
had
been
was
that
his
primary
feeling
had
been
not
shame
at
his
nocturnal
indiscretion
but
relief
he
had
embraced
the
warm
wet
patch
with
his
body
and
blessed
the
reality
of
his
sight
fuck
this
richie
tozier
said
in
a
low
voice
that
was
not
quite
steady
and
started
to
get
up
he
would
go
back
to
the
derry
town
house
and
take
a
nap
if
this
was
memory
lane
he
preferred
the
la
freeway
at
rushhour
the
pain
in
his
eyes
was
probably
no
more
than
a
signal
of
exhaustion
and
jetlag
plus
the
stress
of
meeting
the
past
all
at
once
in
one
afternoon
enough
shocks
enough
exploring
he
didn't
like
the
way
his
mind
was
skittering
from
one
subject
to
the
next
what
was
that
peter
gabriel
tune
shock
the
monkey
well
this
monkey
had
been
shocked
enough
it
was
time
to
catch
some
z
and
maybe
gain
a
little
perspective
as
he
rose
his
eyes
went
to
the
marquee
in
front
of
city
center
again
all
at
once
the
strength
ran
out
of
his
legs
and
he
sat
down
again
hard
richie
tozier
man
of

to

he
felt
as
if
someone
had
whopped
all
the
breath
out
of
him
and
then
he
heard
that
sound
again
that
sound
that
was
half
pressure
on
the
skin
and
eardrums
that
keen
homicidal
whispering
rush
swiipppp
he
rolled
off
the
bench
onto
the
gravel
thinking
so
this
is
what
they
mean
by

now
you
know
you'll
never

he
hit
on
his

and
rolled
looking
up
at
the
paul
bunyan
statue
only
it
was
no
longer
paul
bunyan
the

resplendent
and

plastic
twenty
feet
of
dayglo
colors
its
painted
face
surmounting
a
cosmic
comic
ruff
orange
pompom
buttons
cast
in
plastic
each
as
big
as
a
volleyball
ran
down
the
front
of
the
silvery
suit
instead
of
an
axe
it
held
a
huge
bunch
of
plastic
balloons
engraved
on
each
were
two
legends
it
still
rock
and
roll
to
me
and
richie
tozier
s
all
dea
rock
show
he
scrambled
backward
using
his
heels
and
his
palms
gravel
went
down
the
back
of
his
pants
he
heard
a
seam
tear
loose
in
die
underarm
of
his
rodeo
drive
sportcoat
he
rolled
over
gamed
his
feet
staggered
looked
back
the
down
looked
down
at
him
its
eyes
rolled
wetly
in
ther
sockets
did
i
give
you
a
scare
m'ma
it
rumbled
and
richie
heard
his
mouth
say
quite
independently
of
his
frozen
brain
cheap
thrills
in
the
back
of
my
car
bozo
that
all
the
clown
grinned
and
nodded
as
if
it
had
expected
no
more
red
paintbleeding
lips
parted
to
show
teeth
like
fangs
each
one
coming
to
a
razor
point
i
could
have
you
now
if
i
wanted
you
now
it
said
but
this
is
going
to
be
too
much
fun
fun
for
me
too
richie
heard
his
mouth
say
the
most
fun
of
all
when
we
come
to
take
your
fucking
head
off
baby
the
clown
grin
spread
wider
and
wider
it
raised
one
hand
clad
in
a
white
glove
and
richie
felt
the
wind
of
the
movement
blow
the
hair
off
his
forehead
as
it
had
on
that
day
twentyseven
years
ago
the
clown
index
finger
popped
out
at
him
it
was
as
big
as
a
beam
big
as
a
bea
richie
thought
and
then
the
pain
struck
again
it
drove
nisty
spikes
into
the
soft
jelly
of
his
eyes
he
screamed
and
clutched
at
his
face
before
removing
the
mote
from
thy
neighbor
eye
attend
the
beam
in
thine
own
the
clown
intoned
its
words
rumbling
and
vibrating
and
richie
was
again
enveloped
in
the
sweet
stink
of
its
carrion
breath
he
looked
up
and
took
half
a
dozen
hurried
steps
backward
the
clown
was
bending
down
its
gloved
hands
on
its
gaily
pantalooned
knees
want
to
play
some
more
richie
how
about
if
i
point
at
your
pecker
and
give
you
prostate
cancer
or
i
could
point
at
your
head
and
give
you
a
good
old
brain
tumor
although
i'm
sure
some
people
would
say
that
would
only
be
adding
to
what
was
already
there
i
can
point
at
your
mouth
and
your
stupid
flapping
tongue
will
turn
into
so
much
running
pus
i
can
do
it
richie
want
to
see
its
eyes
were
widening
widening
and
in
those
black
pupils
each
as
big
as
a
softball
richie
saw
the
mad
darkness
that
must
exist
over
the
rim
of
the
universe
he
saw
a
shitty
happiness
that
he
felt
would
drive
him
insane
in
that
moment
he
understood
it
could
do
any
of
these
things
and
more
and
yet
again
he
heard
his
mouth
but
this
time
it
was
not
his
voice
or
any
of
his
created
voices
past
or
present
it
was
a
voice
he
had
never
heard
before
later
he
would
tell
the
others
hesitantly
that
it
was
a
kind
of
mr
jiveass
nigger
voice
loud
and
proud
self
parodying
and
screechy
git
off
man
case
you
big
ole
honky
clown
he
shouted
and
suddenly
he
was
laughing
again
no

no

you
hear
me
you
whiteface
bunghol
richie
thought
the
clown
recoiled
but
he
did
not
stick
around
to
find
out
for
sure
he
ran
elbows
pumping
sportcoat
flying
out
in
wings
behind
him
not
caring
that
a
father
who
had
stopped
so
his
toddler
could
admire
paul
was
now
staring
warily
at
him
as
if
he
had
gone
crazy
as
a
matter
of
fact
folks
richie
thought
j
feel
like
i've
gone
crazy
oh
god
do
i
ever
and
that
had
to
have
been
the
shiniest
grandmaster
flash
imitation
in
history
but
somehow
it
did
the
trick
somehow
and
then
the
clown
voice
thundered
after
him
the
father
of
the
little
boy
did
not
hear
it
but
the
toddler
face
suddenly
pinched
in
upon
itself
and
he
began
to
wail
the
dad
picked
his
son
up
and
hugged
him
bewildered
even
through
his
own
terror
richie
observed
this
little
sideshow
closely
the
voice
of
the
clown
was
perhaps
angrily
gleeful
perhaps
just
angry
we've
got
the
eye
down
here
richie
you
hear
me
the
me
that
crawls
if
you
don't
want
to
fly

great
big
hi

great
big
eye

anytime
just
any
old
time

or

her
neck
get
eddie
to
wear
his
saddleshoes
we'll
play
some
bop
richie
we'll
play
aaallll
the
hits
reaching
the
sidewalk
richie
dared
to
look
back
over
his
shoulder
and
what
he
saw
was
in
no
way
comforting
paul
bunyan
was
still
gone
and
now
the
clown
was
gone
too
where
they
had
stood
there
was
now
a
twentyfoothigh
plastic
statue
of
buddy
holly
he
was
wearing
a
button
on
one
of
the
narrow
lapels
of
his
plaid
sportcoat
richie
tozier
all
dead
rock
show
the
button
read
one
bow
of
buddy
glasses
had
been
mended
with
adhesive
tape
the
little
boy
was
still
crying
hysterically
his
father
was
walking
rapidly
back
toward
downtown
with
the
weeping
child
in
his
arms
he
gave
richie
a
wide
berth
richie
got
walking
feets
don't
fail
me
now
trying
not
to
think
about
we'll
play
aaallll
the
hits
what
had
just
happened
all
he
wanted
to
think
about
was
the
monster
jolt
of
scotch
he
was
going
to
have
in
the
derry
town
house
bar
before
he
went
up
to
take
that
nap
the
thought
of
a
drink
just
your
ordinary
gardem
variety
drink
made
him
feel
a
little
better
he
looked
over
his
shoulder
one
more
time
and
the
fact
that
paul
bunyan
was
back
grinning
at
the
sky
plastic
axe
over
his
shoulder
made
him
feel
better
still
richie
began
to
walk
faster
making
tracks
putting
distance
between
himself
and
that
statue
he
had
even
begun
to
think
about
the
possibility
of
hallucinations
when
the
pain
struck
his
eyes
again
deep
and
agonizing
causing
him
to
cry
out
hoarsely
a
pretty
young
girl
who
had
been
walking
ahead
of
him
looking
dreamily
up
at
the
breaking
clouds
looked
back
at
him
hesitated
then
hurried
over
mister
are
you
all
right
it
my
contacts
he
said
in
a
strained
voice
my
damned
contact
le
oh
my
god
that
hurts
this
time
he
got
his
forefingers
up
so
quickly
he
almost
jabbed
them
into
his
eyes
he
pulled
down
the
lower
lids
and
thought
j
won't
be
able
to
blink
them
out
that
what
going
to
happen
i
won't
be
able
to
blink
them
out
and
it
just
going
to
go
on
hurting
and
hurting
and
hurting
until
i
go
blind
go
blind
go
bl
but
one
blink
did
it
as
one
blink
always
had
the
sharp
and
denned
world
where
colors
stayed
inside
the
lines
and
where
faces
that
you
saw
were
clear
and
obvious
simply
fell
away
wide
bands
of
pastel
fuzz
took
their
place
and
although
he
and
the
highschool
girl
who
was
both
helpful
and
concerned
arched
the
paving
of
the
sidewalk
for
almost
fifteen
minutes
neither
could
find
even
a
single
lens
in
the
back
of
his
head
richie
seemed
to
hear
the
clown
laughing
bill
denbrough
sees
a
ghost
bill
did
not
see
pennywise
that
afternoon
but
he
did
see
a
ghost
a
real
ghost
so
bill
believed
then
and
no
subsequent
event
caused
him
to
change
his
mind
he
had
walked
up
witcham
street
and
paused
for
some
time
by
the
drain
where
george
met
his
end
on
that
rainy
october
day
in
he
squatted
down
and
peered
into
the
drain
which
was
cut
into
the
stonework
of
the
curbing
his
heart
was
beating
hard
but
he
looked
anyway
come
out
why
don't
you
he
said
in
a
low
voice
and
he
had
the
notquitemad
idea
that
his
voice
was
floating
along
dark
and
dripping
passageways
not
dying
out
but
continuing
onward
and
onward
feeding
on
its
own
echoes
bouncing
off
mosscovered
stone
walls
and
longdead
machinery
he
felt
it
float
over
still
and
sullen
waters
and
perhaps
issue
softly
from
a
hundred
different
drains
in
other
parts
of
the
city
at
the
same
time
come
out
of
there
or
we'll
come
in
and
g
get
you
he
waited
nervily
for
a
response
crouched
down
with
his
hands
between
his
thighs
like
a
catcher
between
pitches
there
was
no
response
he
was
about
to
stand
up
when
a
shadow
fell
over
him
bill
looked
up
sharply
eagerly
ready
for
anything
but
it
was
only
a
little
kid
maybe
ten
maybe
eleven
he
was
wearing
faded
boy
scout
shorts
which
displayed
his
scabby
knees
to
good
advantage
he
had
a
freezepop
in
one
hand
and
a
fiberglas
skateboard
which
looked
almost
as
battered
as
his
knees
in
the
other
the
freezepop
was
a
fluorescent
orange
the
skateboard
was
a
fluorescent
green
you
always
talk
into
the
sewers
mister
the
boy
asked
only
in
derry
bill
said
they
looked
at
each
other
solemnly
for
a
moment
and
then
burst
into
laughter
at
the
same
time
i
want
to
ask
you
a
stupid
quehquestion
bill
said
okay
the
kid
said
you
ever
hhear
anything
down
in
one
of
these
the
kid
looked
at
bill
as
though
he
had
flipped
out
ooka
bill
said
forget
i
aasked
he
started
to
walk
away
and
had
gotten
maybe
twelve
steps
he
was
headed
up
the
hill
vaguely
thinking
he
would
take
a
look
at
the
home
place
when
the
kid
called
miste
bill
turned
back
he
had
his
sportcoat
hooked
on
his
finger
and
slung
over
his
shoulder
his
collar
was
unbuttoned
his
tie
loosened
the
boy
was
watching
him
carefully
as
if
already
regretting
his
decision
to
speak
further
then
he
shrugged
as
if
saying
oh
what
the
hell
yeah
yea
yeah
what
did
it
say
don't
know
it
talked
some
foreign
language
i
heard
it
coming
out
of
one
of
those
pumpin
stations
down
in
the
barrens
one
of
those
pumpin
stations
they
look
like
pipes
coming
out
of
the
ground
i
know
what
you
mean
was
it
a
kid
you
heard
at
first
it
was
a
kid
then
it
sounded
like
a
man
the
boy
paused
i
was
some
scared
i
ran
home
and
told
my
father
he
said
maybe
it
was
an
echo
or
something
coming
all
the
way
down
the
pipes
from
someone
house
do
you
believe
that
the
boy
smiled
charmingly
i
read
in
my
ripley
believe
it
or
not
book
that
there
was
this
guy
he
got
music
from
his
teeth
radio
music
his
fillings
were
like
little
radios
i
guess
if
i
believed
that
i
could
believe
anything
aayuh
bill
said
but
did
you
believe
it
the
boy
reluctantly
shook
his
head
did
you
ever
hear
those
voices
again
once
when
i
was
taking
a
bath
the
boy
said
it
was
a
girl
voice
just
crying
no
words
i
was
ascared
to
pull
the
plug
when
i
was
done
because
i
thought
i
might
you
know
drownd
her
bill
nodded
again
the
kid
was
looking
at
bill
openly
now
his
eyes
shining
and
fascinated
you
know
about
those
voices
mister
heard
them
bill
said
a
long
long
time
ago
did
you
know
any
of
the
kkids
that
have
been
murdered
here
son
the
shine
went
out
of
the
kid
eyes
it
was
replaced
by
aution
and
disquiet
my
dad
says
i'm
not
supposed
to
talk
to
strangers
he
says
anybody
could
be
that
killer
he
took
an
additional
step
away
from
bill
moving
into
the
dappled
shade
of
an
elm
tree
that
bill
had
once
driven
his
bike
into
twentyseven
years
ago
he
had
taken
a
spill
and
bent
his
handlebars
not
me
kid
he
said
tve
been
in
england
for
the
last
four
months
i
just
got
into
derry
yesterday
i
still
don't
have
to
talk
to
you
the
kid
replied
that
right
bill
agreed
it
a
ff
free
country
he
paused
and
then
said
i
used
to
pal
around
with
johnny
feury
some
of
the
time
he
was
a
good
kid
i
cried
the
boy
finished
matteroffactly
and
slurped
down
the
rest
of
his
freeze
pop
as
an
afterthought
he
ran
out
his
tongue
which
was
temporarily
bright
orange
and
lapped
off
his
arm
keep
away
from
the
sewers
and
drains
bill
said
quietly
keep
away
from
empty
places
and
deserted
places
stay
out
of
trainyards
but
most
of
all
stay
away
from
the
sewers
and
the
drains
the
shine
was
back
in
the
kid
eyes
and
he
said
nothing
for
a
very
long
time
then
mister
you
want
to
hear
something

movie

shark

tommy
says
it
reared
right
out
of
the
water
like
it
did
at
the
end
of
that
movie
and
tried
to
bite
him

bill
hesitated
he
meant
to
shrug
instead
he
nodded
the
kid
let
out
his
breath
in
a
low
hissing
rush
he
hung
his
head
as
if
ashamed
yeah
sometimes
i
think

have
toys
in
the
attic
i
know
what
you
mean
bill
walked
over
to
the
kid
who
glanced
up
at
him
solemnly
but
didn't
shy
away
this
time
you're
killing
your
knees
on
that
board
son
the
kid
glanced
down
at
his
scabby
knees
and
grinned
yeah

try
it
bill
asked
suddenly

gay
and
uncomplicated

bill
said

insured
he
turned
one
of
the
skateboard’s
scuffed
wheels
with
his
finger
liking
the
speedy
ease
with
which
it
turned
it
sounded
like
there
was
about
a
million
ballbearings
in
there
it
was
a
good
sound
it
called
up
something
very
old
in
bill
chest
some
desire
as
warm
as
want
as
lovely
as
love
he
smiled
what
do
you
think
the
kid
asked
i
think
i'm
¢
gonna
kill
myself
bill
said
and
the
kid
laughed
bill
put
the
skateboard
on
he
sidewalk
and
put
one
foot
on
it
he
rolled
it
back
and
forth
experimentally
the
kid
watched
in
his
mind
bill
saw
himself
rolling
down
witcham
street
toward
jackson
on
the
kid
avocadogreen
skateboard
the
tails
of
his
sportcoat
ballooning
out
behind
him
his
bald
head
gleaming
in
the
sun
his
knees
bent
in
that
fragile
way
snowbunnies
bend
their
knees
their
first
day
on
the
slopes
it
was
a
posture
that
told
you
that
in
their
heads
they
were
already
falling
down
he
bet
the
kid
didn't
ride
the
board
like
that
he
bet
the
kid
rode
to
beat
the
devil
like
there
was
no
tomorrow
that
good
feeling
died
out
of
his
chest
he
saw
all
too
clearly
the
board
going
out
from
under
his
feet
shooting
unencumbered
down
the
street
an
improbable
fluorescent
green
a
color
that
only
a
child
could
love
he
saw
himself
coming
down
on
his
ass
maybe
on
his
back
slow
dissolve
to
a
private
room
at
the
derry
home
hospital
like
the
one
they
had
visited
eddie
in
after
his
arm
had
been
broken
bill
denbrough
in
a
full
bodycast
one
leg
held
up
by
pullies
and
wires
a
doctor
comes
in
looks
at
his
chart
looks
at
him
and
then
says
you
were
guilty
of
two
major
lapses
mr
denbrough
the
first
was
mismanagement
of
a
skateboard
the
second
was
forgetting
that
you
are
now
approaching
forty
years
of
age
he
bent
picked
the
skateboard
back
up
and
handed
it
back
to
the
kid
guess
not
he
said
chicken
the
kid
said
not
unkindly
bill
hooked
his
thumbs
into
his
armpits
and
flapped
his
elbows
buckbuck
buck
he
said
the
kid
laughed
listen
i
got
to
get
home
be
careful
on
that
bill
said
you
can't
be
careful
on
a
skateboar
the
kid
replied
looking
at
bill
as
if
he
might
be
the
one
with
toys
in
the
attic
right
bill
said
okay
as
we
say
in
the
movie
biz
i
hear
you
but
stay
away
from
drams
and
sewers
and
stay
with
your
friends
the
kid
nodded
t'm
right
near
home
so
was
my
brother
bill
thought
tt'll
be
over
soon
anyway
bill
told
the
kid
will
it
the
kid
asked
i
think
so
bill
said
okay
see
you
later
chicken
the
kid
put
one
foot
on
the
board
and
pushed
off
with
the
other
once
he
was
rolling
he
put
the
other
foot
on
the
board
as
well
and
went
thundering
down
the
street
at
what
seemed
to
bill
a
suicidal
pace
but
he
rode
as
bill
had
suspected
he
would
with
lazy
hipshot
grace
bill
felt
love
for
the
boy
and
exhilaration
and
a
desire
to
be
the
boy
along
with
an
almost
suffocating
fear
the
boy
rode
as
if
there
were
no
such
things
as
death
or
getting
older
the
boy
seemed
somehow
eternal
and
ineluctable
in
his
khaki
boy
scout
shorts
and
scuffed
sneakers
his
ankles
sockless
and
quite
dirty
his
hair
flying
back
behind
him
watch
out
kid
you're
not
going
to
make
the
comer
bill
thought
alarmed
but
the
kid
shot
his
hips
to
the
left
like
a
breakdancer
his
toes
revolved
on
the
green
fiberglas
board
and
he
zoomed
effortlessly
around
the
corner
and
onto
jackson
street
simply
assuming
no
one
would
be
there
to
get
in
his
way
kid
bill
thought
it
won't
always
be
that
way
he
walked
up
to
his
old
house
but
did
not
stop
he
only
slowed
his
walk
down
to
an
idler
pace
there
were
people
on
the
lawn
a
mother
in
a
lawn
chair
a
sleeping
baby
in
her
arms
watching
two
kids
maybe
ten
and
eight
play
badminton
in
grass
that
was
still
wet
from
the
rain
earlier
the
younger
of
the
two
a
boy
managed
to
hit
the
bird
back
over
the
net
and
the
woman
called
good
one
scan
the
house
was
the
same
darkgreen
color
and
the
fanlight
was
still
over
the
door
but
his
mother
flowerbeds
were
gone
so
from
what
he
could
see
was
the
junglegym
his
father
had
built
from
scavenged
pipes
in
the
back
yard
he
remembered
the
day
georgie
had
fallen
off
the
top
and
chipped
a
tooth
how
he
had
screamed
he
saw
these
things
the
ones
there
and
the
ones
gone
and
thought
of
walking
over
to
the
woman
with
the
sleeping
baby
in
her
arms
he
thought
of
saying
hello
my
name
is
bill
denbrough
i
used
to
live
here
and
the
woman
saying
that
nice
what
else
could
there
be
could
he
ask
her
if
the
face
he
had
carved
carefully
in
one
of
the
attic
beams
the
face
he
and
georgie
sometimes
used
to
throw
darts
at
was
still
there
could
he
ask
her
if
her
kids
sometimes
slept
on
the
screenedin
back
porch
when
the
summer
nights
were
especially
hot
talking
together
in
low
tones
as
they
watched
heatlightning
dance
on
the
horizon
he
supposed
he
might
be
able
to
ask
some
of
those
things
but
he
felt
he
would
stutter
quite
badly
if
he
tried
to
be
charming
and
did
he
really
want
to
know
the
answers
to
any
of
those
questions
after
georgie
died
it
had
become
a
cold
house
and
whatever
he
had
come
back
to
derry
for
was
not
here
so
he
went
on
to
the
corner
and
turned
right
not
looking
back
soon
he
was
on
kansas
street
headed
back
downtown
he
paused
for
awhile
at
the
fence
which
bordered
the
sidewalk
looking
down
into
the
barrens
the
fence
was
the
same
rickety
wood
covered
with
fading
whitewash
and
the
barrers
looked
the
same
wilder
if
anything
the
only
differences
he
could
see
were
that
the
dirty
smudge
of
smoke
which
had
always
marked
the
town
dump
was
gone
the
dump
had
been
replaced
with
a
modern
waste
treatment
plant
and
a
long
overpass
marched
across
the
tangled
greenery
now
the
turnpike
extension
everything
else
was
so
similar
that
he
might
last
have
seen
it
the
previous
summer
weeds
and
bushes
sloping
down
to
that
flat
marshy
area
on
the
left
and
to
dense
copses
of
junkyscrubby
trees
on
the
right
he
could
see
the
stands
of
what
they
had
called
bamboo
the
silverywhite
stalks
twelve
and
fourteen
feet
high
he
remembered
that
richie
had
once
tried
to
smoke
some
of
it
claiming
it
was
like
the
stuff
jazz
musicians
smoked
and
could
get
you
high
all
richie
had
gotten
was
sick
bill
could
hear
the
trickle
of
water
running
in
many
small
streams
could
see
the
sun
heliographing
off
the
broader
expanse
of
the
kenduskeag
and
the
smell
was
the
same
even
with
the
dump
gone
the
heavy
perfume
of
growing
things
at
the
height
of
their
spring
strut
did
not
quite
mask
the
smell
of
waste
and
human
offal
it
was
faint
but
unmistakable
a
smell
of
corruption
a
whiff
of
the
underside
that
where
it
ended
before
and
that
where
it
going
to
end
this
time
bill
thought
with
a
shiver
in
there
under
the
city
he
stood
awhile
longer
convinced
that
he
must
see
something
some
manifestation
of
the
evil
he
had
come
back
to
derry
to
fight
there
was
nothing
he
heard
water
running
a
springlike
and
vital
sound
that
reminded
him
of
the
dam
they
had
built
down
there
he
could
see
trees
and
bushes
ruffling
in
the
faint
breeze
there
was
nothing
else
no
sign
he
walked
on
dusting
a
faint
whitewash
stain
from
his
hands
as
he
went
he
kept
heading
downtown
halfremembering
halfdreaming
and
here
came
another
kid
this
one
a
little
girl
of
about
ten
in
highwaisted
corduroy
pants
and
a
faded
red
blouse
she
was
bouncing
a
ball
with
one
hand
and
holding
a
babydoll
by
its
blonde
arnel
hair
in
the
other
hey
bill
said
she
looked
up
what
what
the
best
store
in
derry
she
thought
about
it
for
me
or
for
anyone
for
you
bill
said
secondhand
rose
secondhand
clothes
she
said
with
no
hesitation
whatsoever
i
beg
your
pardon
bill
asked
you
beg
what
i
mean
is
that
a
store
name
sure
she
said
looking
at
bill
as
though
he
might
well
be
enfeebled
secondhand
rose
secondhand
clothes
my
mom
says
it
a
junkshop
but
i
like
it
they
have
old
things
like
records
you
never
heard
of
also
postcards
it
smells
like
a
attic
i
have
to
go
home
now
bye
she
walked
on
not
looking
back
bouncing
her
ball
and
holding
her
dolly
by
the
hair
hey
he
shouted
after
her
she
looked
back
whimsically
i
beg
your
whatchamacallit
the
store
where
is
it
she
looked
back
over
her
shoulder
and
said
just
the
way
you're
going
it
at
the
bottom
of
up
mile
hill
bill
felt
that
sense
of
the
past
folding
in
on
itself
folding
in
on
him
he
hadn't
meant
to
ask
that
little
girl
anything
the
question
had
popped
out
of
his
mouth
like
a
cork
flying
from
the
neck
of
a
champagne
bottle
he
descended
upmile
hill
toward
downtown
the
warehouses
and
packing
plants
he
remembered
from
childhood
gloomy
brick
buildings
with
duty
windows
from
which
titanic
meaty
smells
issued
were
mostly
gone
although
the
armour
and
the
star
beef
meatpacking
plants
were
still
there
but
hemphill
was
gone
and
there
was
a
drivein
bank
and
a
bakery
where
eagle
beef
and
kosher
meats
had
been
and
there
where
the
tracker
brother
annex
had
stood
was
a
sign
painted
in
oldfashioned
letters
which
read
just
as
the
girl
with
the
doll
had
said
secondhand
rose
secondhand
clothes
the
red
brick
had
been
painted
a
yellow
which
had
perhaps
been
jaunty
ten
or
twelve
years
ago
but
was
now
dingy
a
color
audra
called
urine
yellow
bill
walked
slowly
toward
it
feeling
that
sense
of
déjà
vu
settle
over
nun
again
later
he
told
the
others
he
knew
what
ghost
he
was
going
to
see
before
he
actually
saw
it
the
showwindow
of
secondhand
rose
secondhand
clothes
was
more
than
dingy
it
was
filthy
no
downcast
antique
shop
this
with
nifty
little
spootbeds
and
hoosier
cabinets
and
sets
of
depression
glassware
highlighted
by
hidden
spotlights
this
was
what
his
mother
called
with
utter
disdain
a
yankee
pawnshop
the
items
were
strewn
in
rickrack
profusion
heaped
aimlessly
here
there
and
everywhere
dresses
slumped
off
coathangers
guitars
hung
from
their
necks
like
executed
criminals
there
was
a
box
of
rpm
records
c
apiece
the
sign
read
twelve
for
a
buck
andrews
sisters
perry
como
jimmy
rogers
others
there
were
kids
outfits
and
dreadfullooking
shoes
with
a
card
in
front
of
them
which
read
seconds
but
not
bad
$
a
pair
there
were
two
tvs
that
looked
blind
a
third
was
casting
bleared
images
of
the
brady
bunch
out
toward
the
street
a
box
of
old
paperbacks
most
with
stripped
covers

for
a
quarter
for
a
dollar
more
inside
some
hot'
sat
atop
a
large
radio
with
a
filthy
white
plastic
case
and
a
tuning
dial
as
big
as
an
alarm
clock
bunches
of
plastic
flowers
sat
in
dirty
vases
on
a
chipped
gouged
dusty
diningroom
table
all
of
these
things
bill
saw
as
a
chaotic
background
to
the
thing
his
eyes
had
fixed
upon
immediately
he
stood
staring
at
it
with
wide
unbelieving
eyes
gooseflesh
ran
madly
up
and
down
his
body
his
forehead
was
hot
his
hands
cold
and
for
a
moment
it
seemed
that
all
the
doors
inside
would
swing
wide
and
he
would
remember
everything
silver
was
in
the
righthand
window
his
kickstand
was
still
gone
and
rust
had
flowered
on
the
front
and
back
fenders
but
the
oogahhorn
was
still
there
on
the
handlebars
its
rubber
bulb
now
glazed
with
cracks
and
age
the
horn
itself
which
bill
had
always
kept
neatly
polished
was
dull
and
pitted
the
flat
package
carrier
where
richie
had
often
ridden
double
was
still
on
the
back
fender
but
it
was
bent
now
hanging
by
a
single
bolt
at
some
point
someone
had
covered
the
seat
with
imitation
tigerskin
which
was
now
rubbed
and
frayed
to
a
point
where
the
stripes
were
almost
indistinguishable
silver
bill
raised
an
absent
hand
to
wipe
away
the
tears
that
were
running
slowly
down
his
cheeks
after
he
had
done
a
better
job
with
his
handkerchief
he
went
inside
the
atmosphere
of
secondhand
rose
secondhand
clothes
was
musty
with
age
it
was
as
the
girl
had
said
a
attic
smell
but
not
a
good
smell
as
some
attic
smells
are
this
was
not
the
smell
of
linseed
oil
rubbed
lovingly
into
the
surface
of
old
tables
or
of
ancient
plush
and
velvet
in
here
was
a
smell
of
rotting
bookbindings
dirty
vinyl
cushions
that
had
been
half
cooked
in
the
hot
suns
of
summers
past
dust
mouseturds
from
the
tv
in
he
window
the
brady
bunch
cackled
and
whooped
competing
with
them
from
somewhere
in
the
back
was
the
radio
voice
of
a
disc
jockey
identifying
himself
as
your
pal
bobby
russell
promising
the
new
album
by
prince
to
the
caller
who
could
give
the
name
of
the
actor
who
had
played
wally
on
leave
it
to
beaver
bill
knew
it
had
been
a
kid
named
tony
dow
but
he
didn't
want
the
new
prince
album
the
radio
was
sitting
on
a
high
shelf
amid
a
number
of
nineteenth
century
portraits
below
it
and
them
sat
the
proprietor
a
man
of
perhaps
forty
who
was
wearing
designer
jeans
and
a
fishnet
teeshirt
his
hair
was
slicked
back
and
he
was
thin
to
the
point
of
emaciation
his
feet
were
cocked
up
on
his
desk
which
was
piled
high
with
ledgers
and
dominated
by
an
old
scrolled
cash
register
he
was
reading
a
paperback
novel
which
bill
thought
had
never
been
nominated
for
the
pulitzer
prize
it
was
called
construction
site
studs
on
the
floor
in
front
of
the
desk
was
a
barber
pole
its
stripe
revolving
up
and
up
into
infinity
its
frayed
cord
wound
across
the
floor
to
a
baseboard
plug
like
a
tired
snake
the
sign
in
front
of
it
read
a
dyeing
breed
$
when
the
bell
over
the
door
jingled
the
man
behind
the
desk
marked
his
place
with
a
matchbook
cover
and
looked
up
help
you
yes
bill
said
and
opened
his
mouth
to
ask
about
the
bike
in
the
window
but
before
he
could
speak
his
mind
was
suddenly
filled
with
a
single
haunting
sentence
words
that
drove
away
all
other
thought
he
thrusts
his
fists
against
the
posts
and
still
insists
he
sees
the
ghosts
what
in
the
name
of
god
thrusts
looking
for
anything
in
particular
the
proprietor
asked
his
voice
was
polite
enough
but
he
was
looking
at
bill
closely
he
looking
at
me
bill
thought
amused
in
spite
of
his
distress
as
if
he
got
an
idea
i've
been
smoking
some
of
that
stuff
that
gets
the
jazz
musicians
high
yes
i
was
ihihinterested
ihin
his
fists
against
the
posts
in
that
puhpuh
post
the
barber
pole
you
mean
the
proprietor
eyes
now
showed
bill
something
which
even
in
his
present
confused
state
he
remembered
and
hated
from
his
childhood
the
anxiety
of
a
man
or
woman
who
must
listen
to
a
stutterer
the
urge
to
jump
in
quickly
and
finish
the
thought
thus
shutting
the
poor
bastard
up
but
i
don't
stutter
i
beat
it
i
don't
fucking
stutter
[and
still
insists
the
words
were
so
clear
in
his
mind
that
it
seemed
someone
else
must
be
speaking
in
there
that
he
was
like
a
man
possessed
by
demons
in
biblical
times
a
man
invaded
by
some
presence
from
outside
and
yet
he
recognized
the
voice
and
knew
it
was
his
own
he
felt
sweat
pop
out
warmly
on
his
face
tcould
give
you
he
sees
the
ghosts
a
deal
on
that
post
the
proprietor
was
saying
tell
you
the
truth
i
can't
move
it
at
two
fifty
i'd
give
it
to
you
for
oneseventyfive
how
that
it
the
only
real
antique
in
the
place
post
pol
bill
almost
screamed
and
the
proprietor
recoiled
a
little
not
the
pole
i'm
interested
in
are
you
okay
mister
the
proprietor
asked
his
solicitous
tone
belied
the
expression
of
hard
wariness
in
his
eyes
and
bill
saw
his
left
hand
leave
the
desk
he
knew
with
a
flash
of
something
that
was
really
more
inductive
reasoning
than
intuition
that
there
was
an
open
drawer
below
bill
own
sightline
and
that
the
proprietor
had
almost
surely
put
his
hand
on
a
pistol
of
some
type
he
was
maybe
worried
about
robbery
more
likely
he
was
just
worried
he
was
after
all
clearly
gay
and
this
was
the
town
where
the
local
juveniles
had
given
adrian
mellon
a
terminal
bath
he
thrusts
his
fists
against
the
posts
and
still
insists
he
sees
the
ghosts
it
drove
out
all
thought
it
was
like
being
insane
where
had
it
come
from
he
thrusts
repeating
and
repeating
with
a
sudden
titanic
effort
bill
attacked
it
he
did
this
by
forcing
his
mind
to
translate
the
alien
sentence
into
french
it
was
the
same
way
he
had
beaten
the
stutter
as
a
teenager
as
the
words
marched
across
his
field
of
thought
he
changed
them
and
suddenly
he
felt
the
grip
of
the
stutter
loosen
he
realized
that
the
proprietor
had
been
saying
something
pppardon
me
said
if
you're
going
to
have
a
fit
take
it
out
on
the
street
i
don't
need
shit
like
that
in
here
bill
drew
in
a
deep
breath
let
start
oove
he
said
pretend
i
just
came
tin
okay
the
proprietor
said
agreeably
enough
you
just
came
in
now
what
the
bbike
in
the
window
bil
said
how
much
do
you
want
for
the
bike
take
twenty
bucks
he
sounded
easier
now
but
his
left
hand
still
hadn't
come
back
into
view
i
think
it
was
a
schwinn
at
one
time
but
it
a
mongrel
now
his
eye
measured
bill
big
bike
you
could
ride
it
yourself
thinking
of
the
kid
green
skateboard
bill
said
i
think
my
bikeriding
days
are
oo
over
the
proprietor
shrugged
his
left
hand
finally
came
up
again
got
a
boy
yyes
how
old
is
he
eh
eh
eleven
big
bike

bill

mind

guest
bill
called
the
derry
public
library
mike
was
there
where
are
you

he
asked
and
then
immediately
are
you
all
right
tm
fine
have
you
seen
any
of
the
others
no

was
a
brief
pause
that
is
i
presume
what
can
i
do
you
for
big
bill
tm
buying
a
bike
bill
said
calmly
i
wondered
if
i
could
wheel
it
up
to
your
house
do
you
have
a
garage
or
something
i
could
store
it
in
there
was
silence
mike
are
you
tm
here
mike
said
ts
it
silver
bill
looked
at
the
proprietor
he
was
reading
his
book
again
or
maybe
just
looking
at
it
and
listening
carefully
ye
he
said
where
are
you
it
called
secondhand
rose
secondhand
clothes
all
right
mike
said
my
place
is
palmer
lane

want

go
up
mainstreet

find
it
all
right
i'll
meet
you

want
some
supper
that
would
be
nice
can
you
get
off
work
no
problem
carole
will
over
for
me
mike
hesitated
again
she
said
that
a
fellow
was
in
about
an
hour
before
i
got
back
here
said
he
left
looking
like
a
ghost
i
got
her
to
describe
him
it
was
ben
you
sure
yeah
and
the
bike
that
part
of
it
too
isn't
it
shouldn't
wonder
bill
said
keeping
an
eye
on
the
proprietor
who
still
appeared
to
be
absorbed
in
his
book
til
see
you
at
my
plac
mike
said
number
don't
forget
won't
thank
you
mike
god
bless
big
bill
bill
hung
up
the
proprietor
promptly
closed
his
book
again
got
you
some
storage
space
my
friend
yeah
bill
took
out
his
traveller
checks
and
signed
his
name
to
a
twenty
the
proprietor
examined
the
two
signatures
with
a
care
that
in
less
distracted
mental
circumstances
bill
would
have
found
rather
insulting
at
last
the
proprietor
scribbled
a
bill
of
sale
and
popped
the
traveller
check
into
his
old
cash
register
he
got
up
put
his
hands
on
the
small
of
his
back
and
stretched
then
walked
to
the
front
of
the
store
he
picked
his
way
around
the
heaps
of
junk
and
almostjunk
merchandise
with
an
absent
delicacy
bill
found
fascinating
he
lifted
the
bike
swung
it
around
and
rolled
it
to
the
edge
of
the
display
space
bill
laid
hold
of
the
handlebars
to
help
him
and
as
he
did
another
shudder
whipped
through
him
silver
again
it
was
silver
in
his
hands
and
he
thrusts
his
fists
against
the
posts
and
still
insists
he
sees
the
ghosts
he
had
to
force
the
thought
away
because
it
made
him
feel
faint
and
strange
that
back
tire
a
little
soft
the
proprietor
said
it
was
in
fact
as
flat
as
a
pancake
the
front
tire
was
up
but
so
bald
the
cord
was
showing
through
in
places
no
problem
bill
said
you
can
handle
it
from
here
i
used
to
be
able
to
handle
it
just
fine
now
i
don't
know
guess
so
bill
said
thanks
sure
and
if
you
want
to
talk
about
that
barber
pole
come
back
the
proprietor
held
the
door
for
him
bill
walked
the
bike
out
turned
left
and
started
toward
main
street
people
glanced
with
amusement
and
curiosity
at
the
man
with
the
bald
head
pushing
the
huge
bike
with
the
flat
rear
tire
and
the
oogahhorn
protruding
over
the
rusty
bikebasket
but
bill
hardly
noticed
them
he
was
narvelling
at
how
well
his
grownup
hands
still
fitted
the
rubber
handgrips
was
remembering
how
he
had
always
meant
to
knot
some
thin
strips
of
plastic
different
colors
into
the
holes
in
each
grip
so
they
would
flutter
in
the
wind
he
had
never
gotten
around
to
that
he
stopped
at
the
corner
of
center
and
main
outside
of
mr
paperback
he
leaned
the
bike
against
the
building
long
enough
to
strip
off
his
sportcoat
pushing
a
bike
with
a
flat
tire
was
hard
work
and
the
afternoon
had
come
off
hot
he
tossed
the
coat
into
the
basket
and
went
on
chain
rusty
he
thought
whoever
had
it
didn't
take
very
good
care
of
him
it
he
stopped
for
a
moment
frowning
trying
to
remember
just
what
had
happened
to
silver
had
he
sold
it
given
it
away
lost
it
perhaps
he
couldn't
remember
instead
that
idiotic
sentence
his
fists
against
the
posts
and
still
insists
resurfaced
as
strange
and
out
of
place
as
an
easy
chair
on
a
battlefield
a
record
player
in
a
fireplace
a
row
of
pencils
protruding
from
a
cement
sidewalk
bill
shook
his
head
the
sentence
broke
up
and
dispersed
like
smoke
he
pushed
silver
on
to
mike
place
mike
hanlon
makes
a
connection
but
first
he
made
supper
hamburgers
with
sauteed
mushrooms
and
onions
and
aspinach
salad
they
had
finished
working
on
silver
by
then
and
were
more
than
ready
to
eat
the
house
was
a
neat
little
cape
cod
white
with
green
trim
mike
had
just
been
arriving
when
bill
pushed
silver
up
palmer
lane
he
was
behind
the
wheel
of
an
old
ford
with
rusty
rocker
panels
and
a
cracked
rear
window
and
bill
remembered
the
fact
mike
had
so
quietly
pointed
out
the
six
members
of
the
loser
club
who
left
derry
had
quit
being
losers
mike
had
stayed
behind
and
was
still
behind
bill
rolled
silver
into
mike
garage
which
was
floored
with
oiled
dirt
and
was
every
bit
as
neat
as
the
house
proved
to
be
tools
hung
from
pegs
and
the
lights
shielded
with
tin
cones
looked
like
the
lights
which
hang
over
pool
tables
bill
leaned
the
bike
against
the
wall
the
two
of
them
looked
at
it
without
speaking
for
a
bit
hands
in
pockets
silver
all
right
mike
said
at
last
i
thought
you
might
have
been
wrong
but
it
him
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
him
fucked
if
i
know
have
you
got
a
bicycle
pump
yeah
i
think
i've
got
a
tire
patching
kit
too
are
those
tubeless
tires
they
always
were
bill
bent
down
to
look
at
the
flat
tire
yeah
tubeless.”
getting
ready
to
ride
it
again
of
ccourse
not
bill
said
sharply
i
just
don't
like
to
see
it
shihitting
there
on
a
flat
whatever
you
say
big
bill
you're
the
boss
bill
looked
around
sharply
at
that
but
mike
had
gone
to
the
garage’s
back
wall
and
was
taking
down
a
tirepump
he
got
a
tin
tirepatching
kit
from
one
of
the
cabinets
and
handed
it
to
bill
who
looked
at
it
curiously
it
was
as
he
remembered
such
things
from
his
childhood
a
small
tin
box
of
about
the
same
size
and
shape
as
those
kept
by
men
who
roll
their
own
cigarettes
except
the
top
was
bright
and
pebbled
you
used
it
for
roughing
the
rubber
around
the
hole
before
you
put
on
the
patch
the
box
looked
brandnew
and
there
was
a
woolco
price
sticker
on
it
that
said
$
it
seemed
to
him
that
when
he
was
a
kid
such
a
kit
had
gone
for
about
a
bucktwentyfive
you
didn't
just
have
this
hanging
around
bill
said
it
wasn't
a
question
n
mike
agreed
i
bought
it
last
week
out
at
the
mall
as
a
matter
of
fact
you've
got
a
bike
of
your
own
n
mike
sail
meeting
his
eyes
you
just
happened
to
buy
this
kit
just
got
the
urge
mike
agreed
his
eyes
still
on
bill
woke
up
thinking
it
might
come
in
handy
the
thought
kept
coming
back
all
day
so
i
got
the
kit
and
here
you
are
to
use
it
here
i
am
to
use
it
bill
agreed
but
like
they
say
on
the
soaps
what
does
it
all
mean
dea
ask
the
others
mike
said
tonight
will
they
all
be
there
do
you
think
don't
know
big
bill
he
paused
and
added
i
think
there
a
chance
that
all
of
them
won't
be
one
or
two
of
them
may
decide
to
just
creep
out
of
town
or
he
shrugged
what
do
we
do
if
that
happens
i
don't
know
mike
pointed
to
the
tirepatching
kit
i
paid
seven
bucks
for
that
thing
are
you
going
to
do
something
with
it
or
just
look
at
it
bill
took
his
sportcoat
out
of
the
basket
and
hung
it
carefully
on
an
unoccupied
wallpeg
then
he
turned
silver
upside
down
so
that
he
rested
on
his
seat
and
began
to
carefully
rotate
the
rear
tire
he
didn't
like
the
rusty
way
the
axle
squeaked
and
remembered
the
almost
silent
click
of
the
ballbearings
in
the
kid
skateboard
a
little
in
oil
would
fix
that
right
up
he
thought
wouldn't
hurt
to
oil
the
chain
either
it
rusty
as
hell
and
playing
cards
it
needs
playing
cards
on
the
spokes
mike
would
have
cards
i
bet
the
good
ones
bikes
with
the
celluloid
coating
that
made
them
so
stiff
and
so
slippery
that
the
first
time
you
tried
to
shuffle
them
they
always
sprayed
all
over
the
floor
playing
cards
sure
and
clothespins
to
hold
them
he
stopped
suddenly
cold
what
in
the
name
of
jesus
are
you
thinking
of
something
wrong
bill
mike
asked
softly
nothing
his
fingers
touched
something
small
and
round
and
hard
he
got
his
nails
under
it
and
pulled
a
small
tack
came
out
of
the
tire
here’s
the
cuhcuhculprit
he
said
and
it
rose
in
his
mind
again
strange
unbidden
and
powerful
he
thrusts
his
fists
against
the
posts
and
still
insists
he
sees
the
ghosts
but
this
time
the
voice
his
voice
was
followed
by
his
mother
voice
saying
try
again
billy
you
almost
had
it
that
time
and
andy
devine
as
guy
madison
sidekick
jingles
yelling
hey
wild
bill
wait
for
me
he
shivered
the
posts
he
shook
his
head
i
couldn't
say
that
without
stuttering
even
now
he
thought
and
for
just
a
moment
he
felt
that
he
was
on
the
edge
of
understanding
it
all
then
it
was
gone
he
opened
the
tirepatching
kit
and
went
to
work
it
took
a
long
time
b
get
it
just
right
mike
leaned
against
the
wall
in
a
bar
of
lateafternoon
sun
the
sleeves
of
his
shirt
rolled
up
and
his
tie
yanked
down
whistling
a
tune
which
bill
finally
identified
as
she
blinded
me
with
science
while
he
waited
for
the
tire
cement
to
set
bill
had
just
for
something
to
do
he
told
himself
oiled
silver
chain
sprocket
and
axles
it
didn't
make
the
bike
look
any
better
but
when
he
spun
the
tires
he
found
that
the
squeak
was
gone
and
that
was
satisfying
silver
never
would
have
won
any
beautycontests
anyway
his
one
virtue
was
that
he
could
go
like
a
blue
streak
by
that
tune
fivethirty
in
the
afternoon
he
had
nearly
forgotten
mike
was
there
he
had
become
completely
absorbed
in
small
yet
utterly
satisfying
acts
of
maintenance
he
screwed
the
nozzle
of
the
pump
onto
the
rear
tire
valve
and
watched
the
tire
fatten
shooting
for
the
right
pressure
by
guess
and
by
gosh
he
was
pleased
to
see
that
the
patch
was
holding
nicely
when
he
thought
he
had
it
right
he
unscrewed
the
pumpnozzle
and
was
about
to
turn
silver
over
when
he
heard
the
rapid
snapflutter
of
playing
cards
behind
him
he
whirled
almost
knocking
silver
over
mike
was
standing
there
with
a
deck
of
bluebacked
bicycle
playing
cards
in
one
hand
want
these
bill
let
out
a
long
shaky
sigh
you've
got
clothespins
too
i
suppose
mike
took
four
from
the
flap
pocket
of
his
shirt
and
held
them
out
just
happened
to
have
them
around
i
subhuppos
yeah
something
like
that
mike
said
bill
took
the
cards
and
tried
to
shuffle
them
his
hands
shook
and
the
cards
sprayed
out
of
his
hands
they
went
everywhere
but
only
two
landed
faceup
bill
looked
at
them
then
up
at
mike
mike
gaze
was
frozen
on
the
littered
playng
cards
his
lips
had
pulled
back
from
his
teeth
the
two
up
cards
were
both
the
ace
of
spades
that
impossible
mike
said
i
just
opened
that
deck
look
he
pointed
at
the
swillcan
just
inside
the
garage
door
and
bill
saw
the
cellophane
wrapper
how
can
one
deck
of
cards
have
two
aces
of
spades
bill
bent
down
and
picked
them
up
how
can
you
spray
a
deck
of
cards
all
over
the
floor
and
have
only
two
of
them
land
face
up
he
asked
that
an
even
better
que
he
turned
the
aces
over
looked
and
then
showed
them
to
mike
one
of
them
was
a
blueback
the
other
a
redback
holy
christ
mikey
what
have
you
got
us
into
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
those
mike
asked
in
a
numb
voice
why
put
them
on
bill
said
and
suddenly
he
began
to
laugh
that
what
i'm
supposed
to
do
isn't
it
if
there
are
certain
preconditions
for
the
use
of
magic
those
preconditions
will
inevitably
arrange
themselves
right
mike
didn't
reply
he
watched
as
bill
went
to
silver
rear
wheel
and
attached
the
playing
cards
his
hands
were
still
shaking
and
it
took
awhile
but
he
finally
got
it
done
drew
in
one
tight
breath
held
it
and
spun
the
rear
wheel
the
playing
cards
machinegunned
loudly
against
the
spokes
in
the
garage
silence
come
on
mike
said
softly
come
on
in
big
bill
i'll
make
us
some
chow
they
had
scoffed
the
burgers
and
now
sat
smoking
watching
dark
begin
to
unfold
from
dusk
in
mike
back
yard
bill
took
out
his
wallet
found
someone
business
card
and
wrote
upon
it
the
sentence
that
had
plagued
him
ever
since
he
had
seen
silver
in
the
window
of
secondhand
rose
secondhand
clothes
he
showed
it
to
mike
who
read
it
carefully
lips
pursed
does
it
mean
anything
to
you
bill
asked
he
thrusts
his
fists
against
the
posts
and
still
insists
he
sees
the
ghosts
he
nodded
yes
i
know
what
that
is
well
then
tell
me
or
are
you
going
to
give
me
some
more
cuhcuhcrap
about
figuring
it
out
for
myself
n
mike
said
in
this
case
i
think
it
okay
to
tell
you
the
phrase
goes
back
to
english
times
it
a
tonguetwister
that
became
a
speech
exercise
for
lispers
and
stutterers
your
mother
kept
trying
to
get
you
to
say
it
that
summer
the
summer
of
you
used
to
go
around
mumbling
it
to
yourself
did
bill
said
and
then
slowly
answering
his
own
question
did
you
must
have
wanted
to
please
her
very
much
bill
who
suddenly
felt
he
might
cry
only
nodded
he
didn't
trust
himself
to
speak
you
never
made
it
mike
told
him
i
remember
that
you
tried
like
hell
but
your
tang
kept
getting
all
tungled
up
but
i
did
say
it
bill
replied
at
least
once
when
bill
brought
his
fist
down
on
the
picnic
table
hard
enough
to
hurt
don't
remember
he
shouted
and
then
dully
he
said
it
again
i
just
don't
remember
chapter
three
uninvited
guests
on
the
day
after
mike
hanlon
made
his
calls
henry
bowers
began
to
hear
voices
voices
had
been
talking
to
him
all
day
long
for
awhile
henry
thought
they
were
coming
from
the
moon
in
the
late
afternoon
looking
up
from
where
he
was
hoeing
in
the
garden
he
could
see
the
moon
in
the
blue
daytime
sky
pale
and
small
a
ghostmoon
that
in
fact
was
why
he
believed
it
was
the
moon
that
was
talking
to
him
only
a
ghost
moon
would
talk
in
ghost
voices
the
voices
of
his
old
friends
and
the
voices
of
those
little
kids
who
had
played
down
in
the
barrens
so
long
ago
those
and
another
voice
one
he
did
not
dare
name
victor
criss
spoke
from
the
moon
first
they
comin
back
henry
all
of
em
man
they
comin
back
to
derry
then
belch
huggins
spoke
from
the
moon
perhaps
from
the
dark
side
of
the
moon
you're
the
only
one
henry
the
only
one
of
us
left
you'll
have
to
get
em
for
me
and
vie
ain't
no
little
kids
can
rank
us
out
like
that
why
i
hit
a
ball
one
time
down
to
tracker
and
tony
tracker
said
that
ball
would
have
been
out
of
yankee
stadium
he
hoed
looking
up
at
the
ghostmoon
in
the
sky
and
after
avhile
fogarty
came
over
and
hit
him
in
the
back
of
the
neck
and
knocked
him
flat
on
his
face
you're
hoein
up
the
peas
right
along
with
the
weeds
you
ijit
henry
got
up
brushing
dirt
off
his
face
and
out
of
his
hair
there
stood
fogarty
a
big
man
in
a
white
jacket
and
white
pants
his
belly
swelled
out
in
front
of
him
it
was
illegal
for
the
guards
who
were
called
counsellors
here
at
juniper
hill
to
carry
billyclubs
so
a
number
of
them
fogarty
adler
and
koontz
were
the
worst
carried
rolls
of
quarters
in
their
pockets
they
almost
always
hit
you
with
them
in
the
same
place
right
in
the
back
of
the
neck
there
was
no
rule
against
quarters
quarters
were
not
considered
a
deadly
weapon
at
juniper
hill
an
institution
for
the
mentally
insane
which
stood
on
the
outskirts
of
augusta
near
the
sidney
town
line
tm
sorry
mr
fogarty
henry
said
and
offered
a
big
grin
which
showed
an
irregular
line
of
yellow
teeth
they
looked
like
the
pickets
in
a
fence
outside
a
haunted
house
henry
had
begun
to
lose
his
teeth
when
he
was
fourteen
or
so
yeah
you're
sorry
fogarty
said
you'll
be
a
lot
sorrier
if
i
catch
you
doing
it
again
henry
yes
sir
mr
fogarty
fogarty
walked
away
his
black
shoes
leaving
big
brown
tracks
in
the
dirt
of
west
garden
because
fogarty
back
was
turned
henry
took
a
moment
to
look
around
surreptitiously
they
had
been
shooed
out
to
hoe
as
soon
as
the
clouds
cleared
everyone
from
the
blue
ward
which
was
where
they
put
you
if
you
had
once
been
very
dangerous
but
were
now
considered
only
moderately
dangerous
actually
all
the
patients
at
juniper
hill
were
considered
moderately
dangerous
it
was
a
facility
for
the
criminally
insane
henry
bowers
was
here
because
he
had
been
convicted
of
killing
his
father
in
the
late
fall
of
it
had
been
a
famous
year
for
murder
trials
all
right
when
it
came
to
murder
trials
had
been
a
pip
only
of
course
it
wasn't
just
his
father
they
thought
he
had
killed
if
it
had
only
been
his
father
henry
would
not
have
spent
twenty
years
in
the
augusta
state
mental
hospital
much
of
that
time
under
physical
and
chemical
restraint
no
not
just
his
father
the
authorities
thought
he
had
killed
all
of
them
or
at
least
most
of
them
following
the
verdict
the
news
had
published
a
frontpage
editorial
titled
the
end
of
derry
long
night
in
it
they
had
recapped
the
salient
points
the
belt
in
henry
bureau
that
belonged
to
the
missing
patrick
hockstetter
the
jumble
of
schoolbooks
some
signed
out
to
the
missing
belch
huggins
and
some
to
the
missing
victor
criss
both
known
chums
of
the
bowers
boy
in
henry
closet
most
damning
of
all
the
panties
found
tucked
into
a
slit
in
henry
mattress
panties
which
had
been
identified
by
laundrymark
as
having
belonged
to
veronica
grogan
deceased
henry
bowers
the
news
declared
had
been
the
monster
haunting
derry
in
the
spring
and
summer
of
but
then
the
news
had
proclaimed
the
end
of
derry
long
night
on
the
front
page
of
its
december
th
edition
and
even
an
ijit
like
henry
knew
that
in
derry
night
never
ended
they
had
bullied
him
with
questions
had
stood
around
him
in
a
circle
had
pointed
fingers
at
him
twice
the
chief
of
police
had
slapped
him
across
the
face
and
once
a
detective
named
lottman
had
punched
him
in
the
gut
telling
him
to
fess
up
and
be
quick
there
people
outside
and
they
ain't
happy
henry
this
lottman
had
said
there
ain't
been
a
lynching
in
derry
for
a
long
tune
but
that
don't
mean
there
couldn't
be
one
he
supposed
they
would
have
kept
it
up
as
long
as
necessary
not
because
any
of
them
really
believed
the
good
derryfolk
were
going
to
break
into
the
police
station
carry
henry
out
and
hang
him
from
a
sourapple
tree
but
because
they
were
desperate
to
close
the
books
on
that
summer
blood
and
horror
they
would
have
but
henry
didn't
make
them
they
wanted
him
to
confess
to
everything
he
understood
after
awhile
henry
didn't
mind
after
the
horror
in
the
sewers
after
what
had
happened
to
belch
and
victor
he
didn't
seem
to
mind
about
anything
yes
he
said
he
had
killed
his
father
this
was
true
yes
he
had
killed
victor
criss
and
belch
huggins
this
was
also
true
at
least
in
the
sense
that
he
had
led
them
into
the
tunnels
where
they
had
been
murdered
yes
he
had
killed
patrick
yes
veronica
yes
one
yes
all
not
true
but
it
didn't
matter
blame
needed
to
be
taken
perhaps
that
was
why
he
had
been
spared
and
if
he
refused
he
understood
about
patrick
belt
he
had
won
it
from
patrick
playing
seal
one
day
in
april
discovered
it
didn't
fit
and
tossed
it
in
his
bureau
he
understood
about
the
books
too
hell
the
three
of
them
chummed
around
together
and
they
cared
no
more
for
their
summer
textbooks
than
they
had
for
their
regular
ones
which
is
to
say
they
cared
for
them
about
as
much
as
a
woodchuck
cares
for
tapdancing
there
were
probably
as
many
of
his
books
in
their
closets
and
the
cops
probably
knew
it
too
the
panties
no
he
didn't
know
how
veronica
grogan
panties
had
come
to
be
in
his
mattress
but
he
thought
he
knew
who
or
what
had
taken
care
of
it
best
not
to
talk
about
such
things
best
to
just
dummy
up
so
they
sent
him
to
augusta
and
finally
in
they
had
transferred
him
to
juniper
hi
and
he
had
only
run
into
trouble
once
here
and
that
was
because
at
first
no
one
understood
a
guy
had
tried
to
turn
off
henry
nightlight
the
nightlight
was
donald
duck
doffing
his
little
sailor
hat
donald
was
protection
after
the
sun
went
down
with
no
light
things
could
come
in
the
locks
on
the
door
and
the
wire
mesh
did
not
stop
them
they
came
like
mist
things
they
talked
and
laughed
and
sometimes
they
clutched
hairy
things
smooth
things
things
with
eyes
the
sort
of
things
that
had
really
killed
vie
and
belch
when
the
three
of
them
had
chased
the
kids
into
the
tunnels
under
derry
in
august
of
looking
around
now
he
saw
the
others
from
the
blue
ward
there
was
george
deville
who
had
murdered
his
wife
and
four
children
one
winter
night
in
george
head
was
studiously
bent
his
white
hair
blowing
in
the
breeze
snot
running
gaily
out
of
his
nose
his
huge
wooden
crucifix
bobbing
and
dancing
as
he
hoed
there
was
jimmy
donlin
and
all
they
said
in
the
papers
about
jimmy
was
that
he
had
killed
his
mother
in
portland
during
the
summer
of
but
what
they
hadn't
said
in
the
papers
was
that
jimmy
had
tried
a
novel
experiment
in
bodydisposal
by
the
time
the
cops
came
jimmy
had
eaten
more
than
half
of
her
including
her
brains
they
made
me
twice
as
smart
jimmy
had
confided
to
henry
one
night
after
lightsout
in
the
row
beyond
jimmy
hoeing
fanatically
and
singing
the
same
line
over
and
over
as
always
was
the
little
frenchman
benny
beaulieu
benny
had
been
a
firebug
a
pyromaniac
now
as
he
hoed
he
sang
this
line
from
the
doors
over
and
over
try
to
set
the
night
on
fire
try
to
set
the
night
on
fire
try
to
set
the
night
on
fire
try
to
it
got
on
your
nerves
after
awhile
beyond
benny
was
franklin
d'cruz
who
had
raped
over
fifty
women
before
being
caught
with
his
pants
down
in
bangor
terrace
park
the
ages
of
his
victims
ranged
from
three
to
eightyone
not
very
particular
was
frank
d'cruz
beyond
him
but
way
back
was
arlen
weston
who
spent
as
much
time
looking
dreamily
at
his
hoe
as
he
did
using
it
fogarty
adler
and
john
koontz
had
all
tried
the
rollof
quarters
inthefist
trick
on
weston
to
try
and
convince
him
he
could
move
a
bit
faster
and
one
day
koontz
had
hit
him
maybe
a
little
too
hard
because
blood
came
not
only
from
arlen
weston
nose
but
also
from
arlen
ears
and
that
night
he
had
a
convulsion
not
a
big
one
just
a
little
one
but
since
then
arlen
had
drifted
further
and
further
into
his
own
interior
blackness
and
now
he
was
a
hopeless
case
almost
totally
unplugged
from
the
world
beyond
arlen
was
you
want
to
pick
it
up
or
i'll
give
you
some
more
help
henry
fogarty
bawled
over
and
henry
began
to
hoe
again
he
didn't
want
any
convulsions
he
didn't
want
to
end
up
like
arlen
weston
soon
the
voices
started
in
again
but
this
tune
they
were
the
voices
of
the
others
the
voices
of
the
kids
that
had
gotten
him
into
this
in
the
first
place
whispering
down
from
the
ghost
moon
you
couldn't
even
catch
a
fatboy
bowers
one
of
them
whispered
now

whispered

beginning

new

rolled
down
his
cheeks
like
tears

henry
another
voice
teased

because
you
couldn't
get

up
so
haha
on
you
henry
haha
all
over
you
he
hoed
madly
weeds
and
dirt
and
peaplants
flying
the
ghostvoices
from
the
ghost
moon
were
very
loud
now
echoing
and
flying
in
his
head
and
fogarty
was
running
toward
him
bellowing
but
henry
could
not
hear
because
of
the
voices
couldn't
even
get
hold
of
a
nigger
like
me
could
you
another
jeering
ghostvoice
chimed
in
we
killed
you
guys
in
that
rockfight
we
fucking
killed
you
haha
asshole
haha
all
over
you
then
they
were
all
babbling
together
laughing
at
him
calling
him
bananaheels
asking
him
how
he'd
liked
the
shocktreatments
they'd
given
him
when
he
came
up
here
to
the
red
ward
asking
him
if
he
liked
it
here
at
juhjuhhooniper
hill
asking
and
laughing
laughing
and
asking
and
henry
dropped
hs
hoe
and
began
to
scream
up
at
the
ghostmoon
in
the
blue
sky
and
at
first
he
was
screaming
in
fury
and
then
the
moon
itself
changed
and
became
the
face
of
the
clown
its
face
a
rotted
pocked
cheesy
white
its
eyes
black
holes
its
red
bloody
grin
turned
up
in
a
smile
so
obscenely
ingenuous
that
it
was
insupportable
and
so
then
henry
began
to
scream
not
in
fury
but
in
mortal
terror
and
the
voice
of
the
clown
spoke
from
the
ghostmoon
now
and
what
it
said
was
you
have
to
go
back
henry
you
have
to
go
back
and
finish
the
job
you
have
to
go
back
to
derry
and
kill
them
all
for
me
for
then
fogarty
who
had
been
standing
nearby
and
yelling
at
henry
for
almost
two
minutes
while
the
other
inmates
stood
in
their
rows
hoes
grasped
in
their
hands
like
comic
phalluses
their
expressions
not
exactly
interested
but
almost
yes
almost
thoughtful
as
if
they
understood
that
this
was
all
a
part
of
the
mystery
that
had
put
them
here
that
henry
bowers
sudden
attack
of
the
screaming
meemies
in
west
garden
was
interesting
in
some
more
than
technical
way
got
tired
of
shouting
and
gave
henry
a
real
blast
with
his
quarters
and
henry
went
down
like
a
ton
of
bricks
the
voice
of
the
clown
following
him
down
into
that
terrible
whirlpool
of
darkness
chanting
over
and
over
again
kill
them
all
henry
kill
them
all
kill
them
all
kill
them
all
henry
bowers
lay
awake
the
moon
was
down
and
he
felt
a
sharp
sense
of
gratitude
for
that
the
moon
was
less
ghostly
at
night
more
real
and
if
he
should
see
that
dreadful
clown
face
in
the
sky
riding
over
the
hills
and
fields
and
woods
he
believed
he
would
die
of
terror
he
lay
on
his
side
staring
at
his
nightlight
intently
donald
duck
had
burned
out
he
had
been
replaced
by
mickey
and
minnie
mouse
dancing
a
polka
they
had
been
replaced
with
the
green
glowing
face
of
oscar
the
grouch
from
sesame
street
and
late
last
year
oscar
had
been
replaced
by
the
face
of
fozzie
bear
henry
had
measured
out
the
years
of
his
incarceration
with
burnedout
nightlights
instead
of
coffee
spoons
at
exactly
a.m
on
the
morning
of
may
th
his
nightlight
went
out
a
little
moan
escaped
him
no
more
koontz
was
on
the
door
of
the
blue
ward
tonight
koontz
who
was
the
worst
of
the
lot
worse
even
than
fogarty
who
lad
hit
him
so
hard
in
the
afternoon
that
henry
could
barely
turn
his
head
sleeping
around
him
were
the
other
blue
ward
inmates
benny
beaulieu
slept
in
elastic
restraints
he
had
been
allowed
to
watch
an
emergency
rerun
on
the
wardroom
tv
when
they
came
in
from
hoeing
and
around
six
o'clock
had
begun
jerking
off
constantly
and
without
let
up
screaming
try
to
set
the
night
on
fire
try
to
set
the
night
on
fire
try
to
set
the
night
on
fire
he
had
been
sedated
and
that
was
good
for
about
four
hours
and
then
he
had
started
in
again
around
eleven
when
the
elavil
wore
off
whipping
his
old
dingus
so
hard
it
had
started
to
bleed
through
his
fingers
shrieking
try
to
set
the
night
on
fire
so
they
sedated
him
again
and
put
him
in
restraints
now
he
slept
his
pinched
little
face
as
grave
in
the
dim
light
as
aristotle
from
around
his
bed
henry
could
hear
low
snores
and
loud
ones
grunts
an
occasional
bedfart
he
could
hear
jimmy
donlin
breathing
it
was
unmistakable
even
though
jimmy
slept
five
beds
over
rapid
and
faintly
whistling
for
some
reason
it
always
made
henry
think
of
a
sewing
machine
from
beyond
the
door
giving
on
the
hall
he
could
hear
the
faint
sound
of
koontz
tv
he
knew
that
koontz
would
be
watching
the
late
movies
on
channel
drinking
texas
driver
and
eating
his
lunch
koontz
favored
sandwiches
made
out
of
chunky
peanutbutter
and
bermuda
onions
when
henry
heard
this
he
had
shuddered
and
thought
and
they
say
all
the
crazy
people
are
locked
up
this
tune
the
voice
didnt
come
from
the
moon
this
time
it
came
from
under
the
bed
henry
recognized
the
voice
at
once
it
was
victor
criss
whose
head
had
been
torn
off
somewhere
beneath
derry
twentyseven
years
ago
it
had
been
torn
off
by
the
frankenstein
monster
henry
had
seen
it
happen
and
afterward
he
had
seen
the
monster
eyes
shift
and
had
felt
its
watery
yellow
gaze
on
him
yes
the
frankensteinmonster
had
killed
victor
and
then
it
had
killed
belch
but
here
was
vie
again
like
the
almost
ghostly
rerun
of
a
hackand
white
program
from
the
nifty
fifties
when
the
president
was
bald
and
the
buicks
had
portholes
and
now
that
it
had
happened
now
that
the
voice
had
come
henry
found
that
he
was
calm
and
unafraid
relieved
even
henr
victor
said
vi
henry
cried
what
you
doing
under
there
benny
beaulieu
snorted
and
muttered
in
his
sleep
jimmy
neat
nasal
sewingmachine
inhales
and
exhales
paused
for
a
moment
in
the
hall
the
volume
on
koontz
small
sony
was
turned
down
and
henry
bowers
could
sense
him
head
cocked
to
one
side
one
hand
on
the
tv
volume
knob
the
fingers
of
the
other
hand
touching
the
cylinder
which
bulged
in
the
righthand
pocket
of
his
whites
the
roll
of
quarters
you
don't
have
to
talk
out
loud
henry
vie
said
i
can
hear
you
if
you
just
think
and
they
can't
hear
me
at
all
what
do
you
want
vie
henry
asked
there
was
no
reply
for
a
long
time
henry
thought
that
maybe
vie
had
gone
away
outside
the
door
the
volume
of
koontz
tv
went
up
again
then
there
was
a
scratching
noise
from
under
the
bed
the
springs
squealed
slightly
as
a
dark
shadow
pulled
itself
out
from
under
vie
looked
up
at
him
and
grinned
henry
grinned
back
uneasily
ole
vie
was
looking
a
little
bit
like
the
frankensteinmonster
himself
these
days
a
scar
like
a
hangrope
tattoo
circled
his
neck
henry
thought
maybe
that
was
where
his
head
had
been
sewed
back
on
his
eyes
were
a
weird
graygreen
color
and
the
corneas
seemed
to
float
on
a
watery
viscous
substance
vie
was
still
twelve
i
want
the
same
thing
you
want
vie
said
i
want
to
pay
em
back
pay
em
back
henry
bowers
said
dreamily
but
you'll
have
to
get
out
of
here
to
do
it
vie
said
you'll
have
to
go
back
to
derry
i
need
you
henry
we
all
need
you
they
can't
hurt
you
henry
said
understanding
he
was
talking
to
more
than
vie
they
can't
hurt
me
if
they
only
halfbelieve
vie
said
but
there
have
been
some
distressing
signs
henry
we
didn't
think
they
could
beat
us
back
then
either
but
the
fatboy
got
away
from
you
in
the
barrens
the
fatboy
and
the
smartmouth
and
the
quiff
got
away
from
us
that
day
after
the
movies
and
the
rockfight
when
they
saved
the
nigger
don't
talk
about
that
henry
shouted
at
vie
and
for
a
moment
all
of
the
peremptory
hardness
that
had
made
him
their
leader
was
in
his
voice
then
he
cringed
thinking
vie
would
hurt
him
surely
vie
could
do
whatever
he
wanted
since
he
was
a
ghost
but
vie
only
grinned
can
take
care
of
them
if
they
only
halfbeliev
he
said
but
you're
alive
henry
you
can
get
them
no
matter
if
they
believe
halfbelieve
or
don't
believe
at
all
you
can
get
them
one
by
one
or
all
at
once
you
can
pay
em
back
pay
em
back
henry
repeated
then
he
looked
at
vie
doubtfully
again
but
i
can't
get
out
of
here
vie
there
wire
on
the
windows
and
koontz
is
on
the
door
tonight
koontz
is
the
worst
maybe
tomorrow
night
don't
worry
about
koontz
vie
said
standing
up
henry
saw
he
was
still
wearing
the
jeans
he
had
been
wearing
that
day
and
that
they
were
still
splattered
with
drying
sewer
muck
ti
take
care
of
koontz
vie
held
out
his
hand
after
a
moment
henry
took
it
he
and
vie
walked
toward
the
blue
ward
door
and
the
sound
of
the
tv
they
were
almost
there
when
jimmy
donlin
who
had
eaten
his
mother
brains
woke
up
his
eyes
widened
as
he
saw
henry
latenight
visitor
it
was
his
mother
her
slip
was
showing
just
a
quarterinch
or
so
as
it
always
had
the
top
of
her
head
was
gone
her
eyes
horribly
red
rolled
toward
him
and
when
she
grinned
jimmy
saw
the
lipstick
smears
on
her
yellow
horsy
teeth
as
he
always
had
jimmy
began
to
shriek
vo
ma
no
ma
no
ma
the
tv
went
off
at
once
and
even
before
the
others
could
begin
to
stir
koontz
was
jerking
the
door
open
and
saying
okay
asshole
get
ready
to
catch
your
head
on
the
rebound
i've
had
it
no
ma
no
ma
please
ma
no
ma
koontz
came
rushing
in
first
he
saw
bowers
standing
tall
and
paunchy
and
nearly
ridiculous
in
his
johnny
his
loose
flesh
doughy
in
the
light
spilling
in
from
the
corridor
then
he
looked
left
and
screamed
out
two
lungfuls
of
silent
spun
glass
standing
by
bowers
was
a
thing
in
a
clown
suit
it
stood
perhaps
eight
feet
tall
its
suit
was
silvery
orange
pompoms
ran
down
the
front
there
were
oversized
funny
shoes
on
its
feet
but
its
head
was
not
that
of
a
man
or
a
clown
it
was
the
head
of
a
doberman
pinscher
the
only
animal
on
god
green
earth
of
which
john
koontz
was
frightened
its
eyes
were
red
its
silky
muzzle
wrinkled
back
to
show
huge
white
teeth
a
cylinder
of
quarters
fell
from
koontz
nerveless
fingers
and
rolled
across
the
floor
and
into
the
corner
late
the
following
day
benny
beaulieu
who
slept
through
the
whole
thing
would
find
them
and
hide
them
in
his
footlocker
the
quarters
bought
him
cigarettes
tailormades
for
a
month
koontz
hitched
in
breath
to
scream
again
as
the
clown
lurched
toward
him
its
time
for
the
circus
the
clown
screamed
in
a
growling
voice
and
its
white
gloved
hands
fell
on
koontz’s
shoulders
except
that
the
hands
inside
those
gloves
felt
like
paws
for
the
third
time
that
day
that
long
long
day
kay
mccall
went
to
the
telephone
she
got
further
this
time
than
she
had
on
he
first
two
occasions
this
time
she
waited
until
the
phone
had
been
picked
up
on
the
other
end
and
a
hearty
insh
cop
voice
said
sixth
street
station
sergeant
o'bannon
how
may
i
help
you
before
hanging
up
oh
you're
doing
fine
jesus
yes
by
the
eighth
or
ninth
time
you'll
have
mustered
up
guts
enough
to
give
him
your
name
she
went
into
the
kitchen
and
fixed
herself
a
weak
scotchandsoda
although
she
knew
it
probably
wasn't
a
good
idea
on
top
of
the
darvon
she
recalled
a
snatch
of
foksong
from
the
college
coffeehouses
of
her
youth
got
a
headful
of
whiskey
and
a
bellyful
of
gin
/
doctor
say
it
kill
me
but
he
don't
say
when
and
laughed
jaggedly
there
was
a
mirror
running
along
the
top
of
the
bar
she
saw
her
reflection
in
it
and
stopped
laughing
abruptly
who
is
that
woman
one
eye
swollen
nearly
shut
who
is
that
battered
woman
nose
the
color
of
a
drunken
knight
after
thirty
or
so
years
of
tilting
at
ginmills
and
puffed
to
a
grotesque
size
who
is
that
battered
woman
who
looks
like
the
ones
who
drag
themselves
to
a
women
shelter
after
they
finally
get
frightened
enough
or
brave
enough
or
just
plain
mad
enough
to
leave
the
man
who
is
hurting
them
who
has
systematically
hurt
them
week
in
and
week
out
month
in
and
month
out
year
in
and
year
out
laddered
scratch
up
one
cheek
who
is
she
kaybird
one
arm
in
a
sling
who
is
it
you
can
it
be
you
here
she
is
miss
america
she
sang
wanting
her
voice
to
come
out
tough
and
cynical
it
started
out
that
way
but
warbled
on
the
seventh
syllable
and
cracked
on
the
eighth
it
was
not
a
tough
voice
it
was
a
scared
voice
she
knew
it
she
had
been
scared
before
and
had
always
gotten
over
it
she
thought
she
would
be
a
long
time
getting
over
this
the
doctor
who
had
treated
her
in
one
of
the
little
cubicles
just
off
emergency
admitting
at
sisters
of
mercy
half
a
mile
down
the
road
had
been
young
and
not
badlooking
under
different
circumstances
she
might
have
idly
or
not
so
idly
considered
trying
to
get
him
home
and
take
him
on
a
sexual
tour
of
the
world
but
she
hadn't
felt
in
the
least
bit
horny
pain
wasn't
conducive
to
horniness
neither
was
fear
his
name
was
geffin
and
she
didn't
care
for
the
fixed
way
he
was
looking
at
her
he
took
a
small
white
paper
cup
to
the
room
sink
halffilled
it
with
water
produced
a
pack
of
cigarettes
from
the
drawer
of
his
desk
and
offered
them
to
her
she
took
one
and
he
lit
it
for
her
he
had
to
chase
the
tip
for
a
second
or
two
with
he
match
because
her
hand
was
shaking
he
tossed
the
match
in
a
paper
cup
fssss
a
wonderful
habit
he
said
righ
oral
fixation
kay
replied
he
nodded
and
then
there
was
silence
he
kept
looking
at
her
she
got
the
feeling
he
was
expecting
her
to
cry
and
it
made
her
mad
because
she
felt
she
might
just
do
that
she
hated
to
be
emotionally
preguessed
and
most
of
all
by
a
man
boyfriend
he
asked
at
last
td
rather
not
talk
about
it
uhhuh
he
smoked
and
looked
at
her
didn't
your
mother
ever
tell
you
it
was
impolite
to
stare
she
wanted
it
to
come
out
hardedged
but
it
sounded
like
a
plea
stop
looking
at
me
i
know
how
i
look
i
saw
this
thought
was
followed
by
another
one
she
suspected
her
friend
beverly
must
have
had
more
than
once
that
the
worst
of
the
beating
took
place
inside
where
you
were
apt
to
suffer
something
that
might
be
called
interspiritual
bleeding
she
knew
what
she
looked
like
yes
worse
still
she
knew
what
she
felt
like
she
felt
yellow
it
was
a
dismal
feeling
til
say
this
just
once
geffin
said
his
voice
was
low
and
pleasant
when
i
work
e.r
my
tum
in
the
barrel
you
might
say
i
see
maybe
two
dozen
battered
women
a
week
the
interns
treat
two
dozen
more
so
look
there
a
telephone
right
here
on
the
desk
it
my
dime
you
call
sixth
street
give
them
your
name
and
address
tell
them
what
happened
and
who
did
it
then
you
hang
up
and
i'll
take
the
bottle
of
bourbon
i
keep
over
there
in
the
file
cabinet
strictly
for
medicinal
purposes
you
understand
and
we'll
have
a
drink
on
it
because
i
happen
to
think
this
is
just
my
personal
opinion
that
the
only
lower
form
of
life
than
a
man
who
would
beat
up
a
woman
is
a
rat
with
syphilis
kay
smiled
wanly
i
appreciate
the
offer
she
said
but
i'll
pass
for
the
time
being
uhhuh
he
said
but
when
you
go
home
take
a
good
look
at
yourself
in
the
mirror
ms
mccall
whoever
it
was
he
jobbed
you
good
she
did
cry
then
she
couldn't
help
it
tom
rogan
had
called
around
noon
of
the
day
after
she
had
seen
beverly
safely
off
wanting
to
know
if
kay
had
been
in
touch
with
his
wife
he
sounded
calm
reasonable
not
the
least
upset
kay
told
him
she
hadn't
seen
beverly
in
almost
two
weeks
tom
thanked
ler
and
hung
up
around
one
the
doorbell
rang
while
she
was
writing
in
her
study
she
went
to
the
door
who
is
it
cragin
flowers
ma'am
a
high
voice
said
and
how
stupid
she
had
been
not
to
realize
it
had
been
tom
doing
a
bad
falsetto
low
stupid
she
had
been
to
believe
that
tom
had
given
up
so
easily
how
stupid
she
had
been
to
take
the
chain
off
before
opening
the
door
in
he
had
come
and
she
had
gotten
just
this
far
you
get
out
of
before
tom
fist
came
flying
out
of
nowhere
slamming
into
her
right
eye
closing
it
and
sending
a
bolt
of
incredible
agony
through
her
head
she
had
gone
reeling
backward
down
the
hallway
clutching
at
things
to
try
and
stay
upright
a
delicate
onerose
vase
that
had
gone
smashing
to
the
tiles
a
coattree
that
had
tumbled
over
she
fell
over
her
own
feet
as
tom
closed
the
front
door
behind
him
and
walked
toward
her
get
out
of
her
she
had
screamed
at
him
as
soon
as
you
tell
me
where
she
is
tom
said
walking
down
the
hall
toward
her
she
was
dimly
aware
that
tom
didn't
look
very
good
well
actually
terrible
might
have
been
a
better
word
and
she
felt
a
dim
but
ferocious
gladness
skyrocket
through
her
whatever
tom
had
done
to
bev
it
looked
as
if
bev
had
given
it
back
in
spades
it
had
been
enough
to
keep
him
off
his
feet
for
one
whole
day
anyhow
and
he
still
didn't
look
as
if
he
belonged
anywhere
but
in
a
hospital
but
he
also
looked
very
mean
and
very
angry
kay
scrambled
to
her
feet
and
backed
away
keeping
her
eyes
on
him
as
you
might
keep
your
eyes
on
a
wild
animal
that
had
escaped
its
cage
i
told
you
i
haven't
seen
her
and
that
was
the
truth
she
said
now
get
out
of
here
before
i
call
the
police
you've
seen
her
tom
said
his
swollen
lips
were
trying
to
grin
she
saw
that
his
teeth
had
a
strange
jagged
look
some
of
the
front
ones
had
been
broken
i
call
up
tell
you
i
don't
know
where
bev
is
you
say
you
haven't
seen
her
in
two
weeks
never
a
single
question
never
a
discouraging
word
even
though
i
know
damn
well
that
you
hate
my
guts
so
where
is
she
you
numb
cunt
tell
me
kay
turned
then
and
ran
for
the
end
of
the
hall
wanting
to
get
into
the
parlor
rake
the
sliding
mahogany
doors
close'd
on
their
recessed
tracks
and
turn
the
thumbbolt
she
got
there
ahead
of
him
he
was
limping
but
before
she
could
slam
the
doors
shut
he
had
inserted
his
body
between
he
gave
one
convulsive
lunge
and
pushed
through
she
turned
to
run
again
he
caught
her
by
her
dress
and
yanked
her
so
hard
he
tore
the
entire
back
of
it
straight
down
to
her
waist
your
wife
made
that
dress
you
shit
she
thought
incoherently
and
then
she
was
twisted
around
where
is
sh
kay
brought
her
hand
up
in
a
walloping
slap
that
rocked
his
head
back
and
started
the
cut
on
the
left
side
of
his
face
bleeding
again
he
grabbed
her
hair
and
pulled
her
head
forward
into
his
fist
it
felt
to
her
for
a
moment
as
if
her
nose
had
exploded
she
screamed
inhaled
to
scream
again
and
began
to
cough
on
her
own
blood
she
was
n
utter
terror
now
she
had
not
known
there
could
be
so
much
terror
in
all
the
wide
world
the
crazy
son
of
a
bitch
was
going
to
kill
her
she
screamed
she
screamed
and
then
his
fist
looped
into
her
belly
driving
the
air
out
of
her
and
she
could
only
gasp
she
began
to
cough
and
gasp
at
the
same
time
and
for
one
terrifying
moment
she
thought
she
was
going
to
choke
where
is
sh
kay
shook
her
head
haven't
seen
her
she
gasped
police
you'll
go
to
jail
asshole
he
jerked
her
to
her
feet
and
she
felt
something
give
in
her
shoulder
more
pain
so
strong
it
was
sickening
he
whirled
her
around
still
holding
onto
her
arm
and
now
he
twisted
her
arm
up
behind
her
and
she
bit
down
on
her
lower
lip
promising
hersef
that
she
would
not
scream
again
where
is
sh
kay
shook
her
head
he
jerked
her
arm
up
again
jerked
it
so
hard
that
she
heard
him
grunt
his
warm
breath
puffed
against
her
ear
she
felt
her
closed
right
fist
strike
her
own
left
shoulderblade
and
she
screamed
again
as
that
thing
in
her
shoulder
gave
some
more
where
is
she
...know
what
don't
know
he
let
go
of
her
and
gave
her
a
push
she
collapsed
to
the
floor
sobbing
snot
and
blood
running
out
of
her
nose
there
was
an
almost
musical
crash
and
when
she
looked
around
tom
was
bending
over
her
he
had
broken
the
top
off
another
vase
this
one
of
waterford
crystal
he
held
the
base
the
jagged
neck
was
only
inches
from
her
face
she
stared
at
it
hypnotized
let
me
tell
you
something
he
said
the
words
coming
out
in
little
pants
and
blows
of
warm
air
you're
going
to
tell
me
where
she
went
or
you're
going
to
be
picking
your
face
up
off
the
floor
you've
got
three
seconds
maybe
less
when
im
mad
it
seems
like
time
goes
a
lot
faster
my
face
she
thought
and
that
was
what
finally
caused
her
to
give
in
or
cave
in
if
you
liked
that
better
the
thought
of
this
monster
using
the
jagged
neck
of
the
waterford
vase
to
cut
her
face
apart
she
went
home
kay
sobbed
her
home
town
derry
it
a
place
called
derry
in
maine
how
did
she
go
she
took
a
bbbus
to
milwaukee
she
was
going
to
fly
from
there
that
shitty
little
cooze
tom
cried
straightening
up
he
walked
around
in
a
large
aimless
semicircle
running
his
hands
through
his
hair
so
that
it
stood
up
in
crazy
spikes
and
whorls
that
cunt
that
cooze
that
nickelplated
crotch
he
picked
up
a
delicate
wood
sculpture
of
a
man
and
woman
making
love
she'd
had
it
since
she
was
twentytwo
and
threw
in
into
the
fireplace
where
it
shattered
to
splinters
he
came
face
to
face
with
himself
for
a
moment
in
the
mirror
over
the
fireplace
and
stood
wideeyed
as
if
looking
at
a
ghost
then
he
whirled
on
her
again
he
had
taken
something
from
the
pocket
of
the
sportcoat
he
was
wearing
and
she
saw
with
a
stupid
kind
of
wonder
that
it
was
a
paperback
novel
the
cover
was
almost
completely
black
except
for
the
redfoil
letters
which
spelled
out
the
title
and
a
picture
of
several
young
people
standing
on
a
high
bluff
over
a
river
the
black
rapids
who
this
fuck
huh
what
denbrough
denbrough
he
shook
the
book
impatiently
in
front
of
her
face
then
suddenly
slapped
her
with
it
her
cheek
flared
with
pain
and
then
dull
red
heat
like
stovecoals
who
is
he
she
began
to
understand
they
were
friends
when
they
were
children
they
both
grew
up
in
derry
he
whacked
her
with
the
book
again
this
time
from
the
other
side
pleas
she
sobbed
please
tom
he
pulled
an
early
american
chair
with
spindly
graceful
legs
over
to
her
turned
it
around
and
sat
down
on
it
his
jackolantern
face
looked
down
at
her
over
the
chairback
listen
to
me
he
said
you
listen
to
your
dd
uncle
tommy
can
you
do
that
you
bra
burning
bitch
she
nodded
she
could
taste
blood
hot
and
coppery
in
her
throat
her
shoulder
was
on
fire
she
prayed
it
was
only
dislocated
and
not
broken
but
that
was
not
the
worst
my
face
he
was
going
to
cut
up
my
face
if
you
call
the
police
and
tell
them
i
was
here
i'll
deny
it
you
can't
prove
a
fucking
thing
it
the
maid
day
off
and
we're
all
by
our
twosome
of
course
they
might
arrest
me
anyway
anything
possible
right
she
found
herself
nodding
again
as
if
her
head
was
on
a
string
sure
it
is
and
what
i'd
do
is
post
bail
and
come
right
back
here
they'd
find
your
tits
on
the
kitchen
table
and
your
eyes
in
the
fishbowl
do
you
understand
me
are
you
getting
your
old
uncle
tommy
kay
burst
into
tears
again
that
string
attached
to
her
head
was
still
working
it
bobbed
up
and
down
wh
what
i
i
don't
wake
up
for
god
sake
why
did
she
go
bac
i
don't
know
kay
nearly
screamed
he
wiggled
the
broken
vase
at
her
don't
know
she
said
in
a
lower
voice
please
she
didn't
tell
me
please
don't
hurt
me
he
tossed
the
vase
in
the
wastebasket
and
stood
up
he
left
without
looking
back
head
down
a
big
shambling
bear
of
a
man
she
rushed
after
him
and
locked
the
door
she
rushed
into
the
kitchen
and
locked
that
door
after
a
moment
pause
she
had
limped
upstairs
as
fast
as
her
aching
belly
would
allow
and
had
locked
the
french
doors
which
gave
on
the
upstairs
verandah
it
was
not
beyond
possibility
that
he
might
decide
to
shinny
up
one
of
the
pillars
and
come
in
again
that
way
he
was
hurt
but
he
was
also
insane
she
went
for
the
telephone
for
the
first
time
and
had
no
more
than
dropped
her
hand
on
it
before
remembering
what
he
had
said
what
i'd
do
is
post
bail
and
come
right
back
here
your
tits
on
the
kitchen
table
and
your
eyes
in
the
fishbowl
she
jerked
her
hand
off
the
phone
she
went
into
the
bathroom
then
and
looked
at
her
dripping
tomato
nose
her
black
eye
she
didn't
weep
the
shame
and
horror
she
felt
were
too
deep
for
tears
oh
bev
i
did
the
best
i
could
dear
she
thought
but
my
face
he
said
he
would
cut
up
my
face
there
was
darvon
and
valium
in
the
medicine
cabinet
she
debated
between
them
and
finally
swallowed
one
of
each
then
she
went
to
sisters
of
mercy
for
treatment
and
met
the
famous
dr
geffin
who
right
now
was
the
only
man
she
could
think
of
whom
she
would
not
be
perfectly
happy
to
see
wiped
off
the
face
of
the
earth
and
from
there
home
again
home
again
jiggetyjog
she
went
to
her
bedroom
window
and
looked
out
the
sun
was
low
on
the
horizon
now
on
the
east
coast
it
would
be
late
twilight
just
going
on
seven
o'clock
in
maine
you
can
decide
what
to
do
about
the
cops
later
the
important
thing
now
is
to
warn
beverly
it
would
be
a
hell
of
a
lot
easier
kay
thought
if
you
had
told
me
where
you
were
staying
beverly
my
love
i
suppose
you
didn't
know
yourself
although
she
had
quit
smoking
two
years
before
she
kept
a
pack
of
pall
malls
in
the
drawer
of
her
desk
for
emergencies
she
shot
one
out
of
the
pack
lit
up
grimaced
she
had
last
smoked
from
this
pack
around
december
of
and
this
baby
was
staler
than
the
era
in
the
illinois
state
senate
she
smoked
it
anyway
one
eye
halflidded
against
the
smoke
the
other
just
halflidded
period
thanks
to
tom
rogan
using
her
left
hand
laboriously
the
son
of
a
bitch
had
dislocated
her
good
arm
she
dialed
maine
information
and
asked
for
the
name
and
number
of
every
hotel
and
motel
in
derry
ma'am
that
going
to
take
awhile
the
directory
assistance
operator
said
dubiously
it
going
to
take
even
longer
than
that
siste
kay
said
tm
going
to
have
to
write
with
my
stupid
hand
my
good
one
on
vacation
tt
not
customary
for
listen
to
me
kay
said
not
unkindly
tm
calling
you
from
chicago
and
i'm
trying
to
reach
a
womanfriend
of
mine
who
has
just
left
her
husband
and
gone
back
to
derry
where
she
grew
up
her
husband
knows
where
she
went
he
got
the
information
out
of
me
by
beating
the
living
shit
out
of
me
this
man
is
a
psycho
she
needs
to
know
he
coming
there
was
a
long
pause
and
then
the
directoryassistance
operator
said
in
a
decidedly
more
human
voice
i
think
the
number
you
really
need
is
the
derry
police
department
fine
i'll
take
that
too
but
she
has
to
be
warmed
kay
said
and
she
thought
of
tom
cut
cheeks
the
knot
on
his
forehead
the
one
on
his
temple
his
limp
his
hideously
swelled
lips
and
if
she
knows
he
coming
that
may
be
enough
there
was
another
long
pause
you
there
sis
kay
asked
arlington
motor
lodge
the
operator
said
bassey
park
inn
the
bunyan
motor
court
slow
down
a
little
okay
she
asked
writing
furiously
she
looked
for
an
ashtray
didn't
see
one
and
mashed
the
pall
mall
out
on
the
desk
blotter
okay

on
the
clarendon
inn

got
halflucky
on
her
fifth

a
message
that

the
instant
she
came
back
no
matter
how
late
it
was
the
desk
clerk
repeated
the
message

upstairs
and
took
another
valium
she
lay
down
and
waited
for
sleep
sleep
didn't
come
i'm

she
thought
looking
into
the
dark
floating
on
the
dope

face

just
couldn't
stand
that
call
soon

the
crazy
son
of
a
bitch
bev
had
married
did
better
on
connections
than
beverly
had
the
day
before
because
he
left
from
o'hare
the
hub
of
commercial
aviation
in
the
continental
united
states
during
the
flight
he
read
and
reread
the
brief
note
on
the
author
at
the
end
of
the
black
rapids
it
said
that
william
denbrough
was
a
native
of
new
england
and
the
author
of
three
other
novels
which
were
also
available
the
note
added
helpfully
in
signet
paperback
editions
he
and
his
wife
the
actress
audra
phillips
lived
in
california
he
was
currently
at
work
on
a
new
novel
noticing
that
the
paperback
of
the
black
rapids
had
been
issued
in
tom
supposed
the
guy
had
written
some
of
the
other
novels
since
then
audra
phillips
he
had
seen
her
in
the
movies
hadn't
he
he
rarely
noticed
actresses
tom
idea
of
a
good
flick
was
a
crime
story
a
chase
story
or
a
monster
picture
but
if
this
babe
was
the
one
he
was
hinking
of
he
had
noticed
her
especially
because
she
looked
a
lot
like
beverly
long
red
hair
green
eyes
tits
that
wouldn't
quit
he
sat
up
a
little
straighter
in
his
seat
tapping
the
paperback
against
his
leg
trying
to
ignore
the
ache
in
his
head
and
in
his
mouth
yes
he
was
sure
audra
phillips
was
the
redhead
with
the
good
tits
he
had
seen
her
in
a
clint
eastwood
movie
and
then
about
a
year
later
in
a
horror
flick
called
graveyard
moon
beverly
had
gone
with
him
to
see
that
one
and
coming
out
of
the
theater
he
had
mentioned
his
idea
that
the
actress
looked
a
lot
like
her
i
don't
think
s
bev
had
said
t'm
taller
and
she
prettier
her
hair
a
darker
red
too
that
was
all
he
hadn't
thought
of
it
again
until
now
he
and
his
wife
the
actress
audra
phillips
tom
had
some
dim
understanding
of
psychology
he
had
used
it
to
manipulate
his
wife
all
the
years
of
their
marriage
and
now
a
nagging
unpleasantness
began
to
nag
at
him
more
feeling
than
thought
it
centered
on
the
fact
that
bev
and
this
denbrough
had
played
together
as
kids
and
that
denbrough
had
married
a
woman
who
in
spite
of
what
beverly
said
looked
amazingly
like
tom
rogan
wife
what
sort
of
games
had
denbrough
and
beverly
played
when
they
were
kids
postoffice
spinthe
bottle
other
games
tom
sat
in
his
seat
and
tapped
the
book
against
his
leg
and
felt
his
temples
begin
to
throb
when
he
arrived
at
bangor
international
airport
and
canvassed
the
rentakcar
booths
the
girls
some
dressed
in
yellow
some
in
red
some
in
irish
green
looked
at
his
blasted
dangerous
face
nervously
and
told
him
more
nervously
still
that
they
had
no
cars
to
rent
so
sorry
tom
went
to
the
newsstand
and
got
a
bangor
paper
he
turned
to
the
wantads
oblivious
to
the
looks
he
was
getting
from
people
passing
by
and
isolated
three
likelies

hit
paydirt

second
call

tii
be
standing
by
the
far
door
you'll
know
me
because
my
face
doesn't
look
so
hot
my
wife
and
i
went
roller
skating
yesterday
and
i
took
one
hell
of
a
fall
things
could
be
worse
i
guess
i
didn't
break
anything
but
my
face
gee
i'm
sorry
to
hear
that
mr
barr
ti
mend
you
just
get
the
car
out
here
my
good
buddy
he
hung
up
walked
across
to
the
door
and
stepped
out
into
the
warm
fragrant
may
night
the
guy
with
the
ltd
showed
up
ten
minutes
later
driving
out
of
the
latespring
dusk
he
was
only
a
kid
they
did
the
deal
the
kid
scribbled
him
a
bill
of
sale
which
tom
stuffed
indifferently
into
his
overcoat
pocket
he
stood
there
and
watched
the
kid
take
off
the
ltd
maine
plates
give
you
an
extra
three
bucks
for
the
screwdriver
tom
said
when
he
was
done
the
kid
looked
at
him
thoughtfully
for
a
moment
shrugged
handed
the
screwdriver
over
and
took
the
three
ones
tom
was
holding
out
none
of
my
business
the
shrug
said
and
tom
thought
how
right
you
are
my
good
little
buddy
tom
saw
him
into
a
cab
then
got
behind
the
wheel
of
the
ford
it
was
a
piece
of
shit
transmission
whiny
universal
groany
body
rattly
brakes
slushy
none
of
it
mattered
he
drove
around
to
the
longterm
parking
lot
took
a
ticket
and
drove
in
he
parked
next
to
a
subaru
that
looked
as
if
it
had
been
there
for
awhile
he
used
the
kid
screwdriver
to
remove
the
subaru
plates
and
put
them
on
the
ltd
he
hummed
as
he
worked
by
p.m
he
was
driving
east
on
route
a
maine
roadmap
open
on
the
seat
beside
him
he
had
discovered
that
the
ltd
radio
didn't
work
so
he
drove
in
silence
that
was
all
right
he
had
plenty
to
think
about
all
the
wonderful
things
he
was
going
to
do
to
beverly
when
he
caught
up
with
her
for
instance
he
was
sure
in
his
heart
quite
sure
that
beverly
was
close
by
and
smoking
oh
my
dear
girl
you
fucked
with
the
wrong
man
when
you
fucked
with
tom
rogan
and
the
question
is
this
what
exactly
are
we
to
do
with
you
the
ford
bulled
its
way
through
the
night
chasing
its
high
beams
and
by
the
time
tom
got
to
newport
he
knew
he
found
a
drugsandsundries
shop
on
the
main
drag
that
was
still
open
he
went
inside
and
bought
a
carton
of
camels
the
proprietor
wished
him
a
good
evening
tom
wished
him
the
same
he
tossed
the
carton
on
the
seat
and
got
moving
again
he
drove
slowly
on
up
route
hunting
for
his
turnoff
here
it
was
route
with
a
sign
which
read
haven
derry
he
made
the
turn
and
got
the
ford
rolling
faster
he
glanced
at
the
carton
of
cigarettes
and
smiled
a
little
in
the
green
glow
of
the
dashlights
his
cut
and
lumpy
face
looked
strange
ghoulish
got
some
cigarettes
for
you
bevvie
tom
thought
as
the
wagon
ran
between
stands
of
pine
and
spruce
heading
toward
derry
at
a
little
better
than
sixty
oh
my
yes
a
whole
carton
just
for
you
and
when
i
see
you
dear
i'm
going
to
make
you
eat
every
fucking
one
and
if
this
guy
denbrough
needs
some
education
we
can
arrange
that
too
no
problem
bevvie
no
problem
at
all
for
the
first
time
since
the
dirty
bitch
had
bushwhacked
him
and
run
out
tom
began
to
feel
good
audra
denbrough
flew
first
class
to
maine
in
a
british
airways
dc
she
had
left
heathrow
at
ten
minutes
of
six
that
afternoon
and
had
been
chasing
the
sun
ever
since
the
sun
was
winning
had
won
in
fact
but
that
didn't
really
matter
by
a
stroke
of
providential
luck
she
had
discovered
that
british
airways
flight
london
to
los
angeles
made
one
refueling
stop
at
bangor
international
airport
the
day
had
been
a
crazy
nightmare
freddie
firestone
the
producer
of
attic
room
had
of
course
wanted
bill
first
thing
there
had
been
some
kind
of
ballsup
about
the
stuntwoman
who
was
supposed
to
fall
down
a
flight
of
stairs
for
audra
it
seemed
that
stuntpeople
had
a
union
too
and
this
woman
had
fulfilled
her
quota
of
stunts
for
the
week
or
some
silly
thing
the
union
was
demanding
that
freddie
either
sign
an
extensionofsalary
waiver
or
hire
another
woman
to
do
the
stunt
the
problem
was
there
was
no
other
woman
close
enough
to
audra
bodytype
available
freddie
told
the
union
boss
that
they
would
have
to
get
a
man
to
do
the
stunt
then
wouldn't
they
it
wasn't
as
if
the
fall
had
to
be
taken
in
bra
and
panties
they
had
the
auburn
haired
wig
and
the
wardrobe
woman
could
fit
the
fellow
up
with
falsies
and
hippadding
even
some
arse
pads
if
that
was
necessary
can't
be
done
mate
the
union
boss
said
against
the
union
charter
to
have
a
man
step
in
for
a
woman
sexual
discrimination
in
the
movie
business
freddie
temper
was
fabled
and
at
that
point
he
had
lost
it
he
told
the
union
boss
a
fat
man
whose
bo
was
almost
paralyzing
to
bugger
himself
the
union
boss
told
freddie
he
better
watch
his
gob
œ
there
would
be
no
more
stunts
on
the
set
of
attic
room
at
all
then
he
had
rubbed
his
thumb
and
forefinger
together
in
a
baksheesh
gesture
that
had
driven
freddie
crazy
the
union
boss
was
big
but
soft
freddie
who
still
played
football
every
chance
he
got
and
who
had
once
scored
a
century
at
cricket
was
big
and
hard
he
threw
the
union
boss
out
went
back
into
his
office
to
meditate
and
then
came
out
again
twenty
minutes
later
hollering
for
bill
he
wanted
the
entire
scene
rewritten
so
that
the
fall
could
be
scrubbed
audra
had
to
tell
freddie
that
bill
was
no
longer
in
england
what
freddie
said
his
mouth
hung
open
he
was
looking
at
audra
as
if
he
believed
she
had
gone
mad
what
are
you
telling
me
he
been
called
back
to
the
states
that
what
i'm
telling
you
freddie
made
as
if
to
grab
her
and
audra
shrank
back
a
bit
afraid
freddie
looked
down
at
his
hands
then
put
them
in
his
pockets
and
only
looked
at
her
t'm
sorry
freddie
she
said
in
a
small
voice
really
she
got
up
and
poured
herself
a
cup
of
coffee
from
the
silex
on
freddie
hotplate
noticing
that
her
hands
were
trembling
slightly
as
she
sat
down
she
heard
freddie
amplified
voice
over
the
studio
loudspeakers
telling
everyone
to
go
home
or
to
the
pub
the
day
shooting
was
off
audra
winced
there
went
a
minimum
of
ten
thousand
pounds
right
down
the
bog
freddie
turned
off
the
studio
intercom
got
up
poured
his
own
cup
of
coffee
he
sat
down
again
and
offered
her
his
pack
of
silk
cut
cigarettes
audra
shook
her
head
freddie
took
one
lit
it
and
squinted
at
her
through
the
smoke
this
is
serious
isn't
it
yes
audra
said
keeping
her
composure
as
best
she
could
what
happened
and
because
she
genuinely
liked
freddie
and
genuinely
trusted
him
audra
told
him
everything
she
knew
freddie
listened
intently
gravely
it
didn't
take
long
to
tell
doors
were
still
slamming
and
engines
starting
in
the
parking
lot
outside
when
she
finished
freddie
was
silent
for
sone
time
looking
out
his
window
then
he
swung
back
to
her
he
had
a
nervous
breakdown
of
some
sort
audra
shook
her
head
no
it
wasn't
like
that
he
wasn't
like
that
she
swallowed
and
added
maybe
you
had
to
be
there
freddie
smiled
crookedly
you
must
realize
that
grown
men
rarely
feel
compelled
to
honor
promises
they
made
as
little
boys
and
you've
read
bill
work
you
know
how
much
of
it
is
about
childhood
and
it
very
good
stuff
indeed
very
much
on
the
nail
the
idea
that
he
forgotten
everything
that
ever
happened
to
him
back
then
is
absurd
the
scars
on
his
hands
audra
said
they
were
never
there
not
until
this
morning
bollocks
you
just
didn't
notice
them
until
this
morning
she
shrugged
helplessly
i'd've
noticed
she
could
see
he
didn't
believe
that
either
what
to
do
then
freddie
asked
her
and
she
could
only
shake
her
head
freddie
lit
another
cigarette
from
the
smoldering
end
of
the
first
i
can
square
it
with
the
union
bos
he
said
not
myself
maybe
right
now
he'd
see
me
in
hell
before
giving
me
another
stunt
i'll
send
teddy
rowland
round
to
his
office
teddy
a
pouf
but
he
could
talk
the
birds
down
from
the
trees
but
what
happens
after
we've
got
four
weeks
of
shooting
left
and
here
your
husband
somewhere
in
massachusetts
maine
he
waved
a
hand
wherever
and
how
much
good
are
you
going
to
be
without
him
tw
he
leaned
forward
like
you
audra
i
genuinely
do
and
i
like
bill
even
in
spite
of
this
mess
we
can
make
do
i
guess
if
the
script
needs
cobbling
up
i
can
cobble
it
i've
done
my
share
of
that
sort
of
shoemaking
in
my
time
christ
knows
if
he
doesn't
like
the
way
it
turns
out
he'll
have
no
one
but
himself
to
blame
i
can
do
without
bill
but
i
can't
do
without
you
i
can't
have
you
running
off
to
the
states
after
your
man
and
i've
got
to
have
you
putting
out
at
full
power
can
you
do
that
i
don't
know
nor
do
i
but
i
want
you
to
think
about
something
we
can
keep
things
quiet
for
awhile
maybe
for
the
rest
of
the
shoot
if
you'll
stand
up
like
a
trouper
and
do
your
job
but
if
you
take
off
it
can't
be
kept
quiet
i
can
be
pissy
but
i'm
not
vindictive
by
nature
and
i'm
not
going
to
tell
you
that
if
you
take
off
i'll
see
that
you
never
work
in
the
business
again
but
you
should
know
that
if
you
get
a
reputation
for
temperament
you
might
end
up
stuck
with
just
that
i'm
talking
to
you
like
a
dutch
uncle
i
know
do
you
resent
it
n
she
said
listlessly
in
truth
she
didn't
care
much
one
way
or
the
other
bill
was
all
she
could
think
of
freddie
was
a
nice
enough
man
but
freddie
didn't
understand
in
the
last
analysis
nice
man
or
not
all
he
could
think
of
was
what
this
was
going
to
do
to
his
picture
he
had
not
seen
the
look
in
bill
eyes
or
heard
him
stutter
good
he
stood
up
come
on
over
to
the
hare
and
hounds
with
me
we
can
both
use
a
drink
she
shook
her
head
a
drink
the
last
thing
i
need
i'm
going
home
and
think
this
out
tl
call
for
the
car
he
said
no
i'll
take
the
train
he
looked
at
her
fixedly
one
hand
on
the
telephone
i
believe
you
mean
to
go
after
hi
freddie
said
and
i'm
telling
you
that
its
a
serious
mistake
dear
girl
he
got
a
lee
in
his
bonnet
but
at
bottom
he
steady
enough
he'll
shake
it
and
when
he
does
he'll
come
back
if
he'd
wanted
you
along
he
would
have
said
so
i
haven't
decided
anything
she
said
knowing
that
she
had
in
fact
decided
everything
had
decided
even
before
the
car
picked
her
up
that
morning
have
a
care
love
freddie
said
don't
do
something
you'll
regret
later
she
felt
the
force
of
his
personality
beating
on
her
demanding
that
she
give
in
make
the
promise
do
her
job
wait
passively
for
bill
to
come
back
or
to
disappear
again
into
that
hole
of
the
past
from
which
he
had
come
she
went
to
him
and
kissed
him
lightly
on
the
cheek
til
see
you
freddie
she
went
home
and
called
british
airways
she
told
the
clerk
she
might
be
interested
in
reaching
a
small
maine
city
called
derry
if
it
was
at
all
possible
there
had
been
silence
while
the
woman
consulted
her
computer
terminal
and
then
the
news
like
a
sign
from
heaven
that
ba
#
made
a
stop
in
bangor
which
was
less
than
fifty
miles
away
shall
i
book
the
flight
for
you
ma'am
audra
closed
her
eyes
and
saw
freddie
craggy
mostly
kind
very
earnest
face
heard
him
saying
have
a
care
love
don't
do
something
you'll
regret
later
freddie
didn't
want
her
to
go
bill
didn't
want
her
to
go
so
why
was
her
heart
screaming
at
her
that
she
had
to
go
she
closed
her
eyes
jesus
i
feel
so
fucked
up
ma'am
are
you
still
holding
the
wire
book
it
audra
said
then
hesitated
have
a
care
love
maybe
she
should
sleep
on
it
get
some
distance
between
herself
and
the
craziness
she
began
to
rummage
in
her
purse
for
her
american
express
card
for
tomorrow
first
class
if
you
have
it
but
i'll
take
anything
and
if
i
change
my
mind
i
can
cancel
probably
will
i'll
wake
up
sane
and
everything
will
be
clear
but
nothing
had
been
clear
this
morning
and
her
heart
clamored
just
as
loudly
for
her
to
go
her
sleep
had
been
a
crazy
tapestry
of
nightmares
so
she
had
called
freddie
not
because
she
wanted
to
but
because
she
felt
she
owed
him
that
she
had
not
gotten
far
she
was
trying
in
some
stumbling
way
to
tell
him
how
much
she
felt
bill
might
need
her
when
there
was
a
soft
click
at
freddie
end
he
had
hung
up
without
saying
a
word
after
his
initial
hello
but
in
a
way
audra
thought
that
soft
click
said
everything
that
needed
to
be
said
the
plane
landed
at
bangor
at
edt
audra
was
the
only
passenger
to
deplane
and
the
others
looked
at
her
with
a
kind
of
thoughtful
curiosity
probably
wondering
why
anyone
would
choose
to
get
off
here
in
this
godforsaken
little
place
audra
thought
of
telling
them
i'm
looking
for
my
husband
that
why
he
came
back
to
a
little
town
near
here
because
one
of
his
boyhood
chums
called
him
and
reminded
him
of
a
promise
he
couldn't
quite
remember
the
call
also
reminded
him
that
he
hadn't
thought
of
his
dead
brother
in
over
twenty
years
oh
yes
it
also
brought
back
his
stutter
and
some
funny
white
scars
on
the
palms
of
his
hands
and
then
she
thought
the
customs
agent
standing
by
in
the
jetway
would
whistle
up
the
men
in
the
white
coats
she
collected
her
single
piece
of
luggage
it
looked
very
lonely
riding
the
carousel
all
by
itself
and
approached
the
rentalcar
booths
as
tom
rogan
would
about
an
hour
later
her
luck
was
better
than
his
would
be
national
car
rental
had
a
datsun
the
girl
filled
out
the
form
and
audra
signed
it
i
thought
it
was
you
the
girl
said
and
then
timidly
might
i
please
have
your
autograph
audra
gave
it
writing
her
name
on
the
back
of
a
rental
form
and
thought
enjoy
it
while
you
can
girl
if
freddie
firestone
is
right
it
won't
be
worth
doodleysquat
five
years
from
now
with
some
amusement
she
realized
that
after
only
fifteen
minutes
back
in
the
states
she
had
begun
to
think
like
an
american
again
she
got
a
roadmap
and
the
girl
so
starstruck
she
could
barely
talk
managed
to
trace
out
her
best
route
to
derry
ten
minutes
later
audra
was
on
the
road
reminding
herself
at
every
intersection
that
if
she
forgot
and
began
driving
on
the
left
they
would
be
scrubbing
her
off
the
asphalt
and
as
she
drove
she
realized
that
she
was
more
frightened
than
she
had
ever
been
in
her
life
by
one
of
those
odd
quirks
of
fate
or
coincidence
which
sometimes
obtain
and
which
in
truth
obtained
more
frequently
in
derry
tom
had
taken
a
room
at
the
koala
inn
on
outer
jackson
street
and
audra
had
taken
a
room
at
the
holiday
inn
the
two
motels
were
side
by
side
their
parking
lots
divided
only
by
a
raised
concrete
sidewalk
and
as
it
so
happened
audra
rented
datsun
and
tom
purchased
ltd
wagon
were
parked
nosetonose
separated
only
by
that
walkway
both
slept
now
audra
quietly
on
her
side
tom
rogan
on
his
back
snoring
so
heavily
that
his
swollen
lips
flapped
henry
spent
that
day
hiding
hiding
in
the
puckies
beside
route
sometimes
he
slept
sometimes
he
lay
watching
police
cruisers
slide
by
like
hunting
dogs
while
the
losers
ate
lunch
henry
listened
to
voices
from
the
moon
and
when
dark
fell
he
went
out
to
the
verge
of
the
road
and
stuck
out
his
thumb
after
awhile
some
fool
came
along
and
picked
him
up
derry
the
third
interlude
a
bird
came
down
the
walk
he
did
not
know
i
saw
he
bit
an
angleworm
in
halves
and
ate
the
fellow
raw
emily
dickinson
a
bird
came
down
the
walk
march
th
the
fire
at
the
black
spot
happened
in
the
late
fall
of
so
far
as
i
am
able
to
determine
that
fire
the
one
my
father
barely
escaped
ended
the
cycle
of
murder
and
disappearance
which
happened
in
the
years
just
as
the
explosion
at
the
ironworks
ended
a
cycle
some
twentyfive
years
before
it
is
as
if
a
monstrous
sacrifice
is
needed
at
the
end
of
the
cycle
to
quiet
whatever
terrible
force
it
is
which
works
here
to
send
it
to
sleep
for
another
quartercentury
or
so
but
if
such
a
sacrifice
is
needed
to
end
each
cycle
it
seems
that
some
similar
event
is
needed
to
set
each
cycle
in
motion
which
brings
me
to
the
bradley
gang
their
execution
took
place
at
the
threeway
intersection
of
canal
main
and
kansas
not
far
in
fact
from
the
place
shown
in
the
picture
which
began
to
move
for
bill
and
richie
one
day
in
june
of
some
thirteen
months
before
the
fire
at
the
black
spot
in
october
of
not
long
before
the
stock
market
crash
as
with
the
fire
at
the
black
spot
many
derry
residents
affect
not
to
remember
what
happened
that
day
or
they
were
out
of
town
visiting
relatives
or
they
were
napping
that
afternoon
and
ver
found
out
what
had
happened
until
they
heard
it
on
the
radio
news
that
night
or
they
will
simply
look
you
full
in
the
face
and
lie
to
you
the
police
logs
for
that
day
indicate
that
chief
sullivan
was
not
even
in
town
sure
i
remember
aloysius
nell
told
me
from
a
chair
on
the
sunterrace
of
the
paulson
nursing
home
in
bangor
that
was
my
first
year
on
the
force
and
i
ought
to
remember
he
was
off
in
western
maine
birdhunting
they'd
been
sheeted
and
carried
off
by
the
time
he
got
back
madder
than
a
wet
hen
was
jim
sullivan
but
a
picture
in
a
reference
book
on
gangsters
called
bloodletters
and
badmen
shows
a
grinning
man
standing
beside
the
bulletriddled
corpse
of
al
bradley
in
the
morgue
and
if
that
man
is
not
chief
sullivan
it
is
surely
his
twin
brother
it
was
from
mr
keene
that
i
finally
got
what
i
believe
to
be
the
true
version
of
the
story
norbert
keene
who
was
the
proprietor
of
the
center
street
drug
store
from
until
he
talked
to
me
willingly
enough
but
like
betty
ripsom
father
he
made
me
turn
off
my
taperecorder
before
he
would
really
unwind
the
tale
not
that
it
mattered
i
can
hear
his
papery
voice
yet
another
a
capella
singer
in
the
damned
choir
that
is
this
town
no
reason
not
to
tell
you
he
said
no
one
will
print
it
and
no
one
would
believe
it
even
if
they
did
he
offered
me
an
oldfashioned
apothecary
jar
licorice
whip
as
i
remember
you
were
always
partial
to
the
red
ones
mikey
i
took
one
was
chief
sullivan
there
that
day
mr
keene
laughed
and
took
a
licorice
whip
for
himself
you
wondered
about
that
did
you
i
wondered
i
agreed
chewing
a
piece
of
the
red
licorice
i
hadn't
had
one
since
i
was
a
kid
shoving
my
pennies
across
the
counter
to
a
much
younger
and
sprer
mr
keene
it
tasted
just
as
fine
as
it
had
back
then
you're
too
young
to
remember
when
bobby
thomson
hit
his
home
run
for
the
giants
in
the
playoff
game
in
mr
keene
said
you
wouldn't
have
been
but
four
years
old
well
they
ran
an
artick
about
that
game
in
the
newspaper
a
few
years
after
and
it
seemed
like
just
about
a
million
folks
from
new
york
claimed
they
were
there
in
the
ballpark
that
day
mr
keene
gummed
his
licorice
whip
and
a
little
dark
drool
ran
down
from
the
corner
of
his
mouth
he
wiped
it
off
fastidiously
with
his
handkerchief
we
were
sitting
in
the
office
behind
the
drugstore
because
although
norbert
keene
was
eightyfive
and
retired
ten
years
he
still
did
the
books
for
his
grandson
just
the
opposite
when
it
comes
to
the
bradley
gan
keene
exclaimed
he
was
smiling
but
it
was
not
a
pleasant
smile
it
was
cynical
coldly
reminiscent
there
was
maybe
twenty
thousand
people
who
lived
in
downtown
derry
back
then
main
street
and
canal
street
had
both
been
paved
for
four
years
but
kansas
street
was
still
dirt
raised
dust
in
the
summer
and
turned
into
a
boghole
every
march
and
november
they
used
to
oil
upmile
hill
every
june
and
every
fourth
of
july
the
mayor
would
talk
about
how
they
were
going
to
pave
kansas
street
but
it
never
happened
until
it
but
what
was
i
saying
twenty
thousand
people
who
lived
right
downtown
i
prompted
ayuh
well
of
those
twenty
thousand
there
probably
half
that
have
passed
away
since
maybe
even
more
fifty
years
is
a
long
time
and
people
have
a
funny
way
of
dying
young
in
derry
perhaps
it
is
the
air
but
of
those
left
i
don't
think
you'd
find
more
than
a
dozen
who'd
say
they
were
in
town
the
day
the
bradley
gang
went
to
tophet
butch
rowden
over
at
the
meat
market
would
fess
up
to
it
i
guess
he
keeps
a
picture
of
one
of
the
cars
they
had
up
on
the
wall
where
he
cuts
meat
looking
at
that
picture
you'd
hardly
know
it
was
a
car
charlotte
littlefield
would
tell
you
a
thing
or
two
if
you
could
get
on
her
good
side
she
teaches
over
to
the
high
school
and
although
i
reckon
she
must
not
have
been
more
than
ten
or
twelve
at
the
tune
i
bet
she
remembers
plenty
carl
snow
aubrey
stacey
eben
stampnell
and
that
old
geezer
who
paints
those
funny
pictures
and
drinks
all
night
at
wally
pickman
i
think
his
name
is
they'd
remember
they
were
all
there
he
trailed
off
vaguely
looking
at
the
licorice
whip
in
his
hand
i
thought
of
prodding
him
and
decided
not
to
at
last
he
said
most
of
the
others
would
lie
about
it
the
way
people
lied
and
said
they
were
there
when
bobby
thomson
hit
his
homer
that
all
i
mean
but
people
lied
about
being
at
that
ballgame
because
they
wished
they
had
been
there
people
would
lie
to
you
about
being
in
derry
that
day
because
they
wish
they
hadn't
been
do
you
understand
me
sonny
i
nodded
you
sure
you
want
to
hear
the
rest
of
this
mr
keene
asked
me
you're
looking
a
bit
peaked
mr
mikey
i
don't
i
said
but
i
think
i
better
all
the
same
okay
mr
keene
said
mildly
it
was
my
day
for
memories
as
he
offered
me
the
apothecary
jar
with
the
licorice
whips
in
it
i
suddenly
remembered
a
radio
program
my
mother
and
dad
used
to
listen
to
when
i
was
just
a
little
kid
mr
keene
tracer
of
lost
persons
sheriff
was
there
that
day
all
right
he
was
s'posed
to
go
birdhunting
but
he
changed
his
mind
damn
quick
when
lal
machen
came
in
and
told
nun
that
he
was
expecting
al
bradley
that
very
afternoon
how
did
machen
know
that
i
asked
well
that
an
instructive
tale
in
itself
mr
keene
said
and
the
cynical
smile
creased
his
face
again
bradley
wasn't
never
public
enemy
number
one
on
the
fbi
hit
parade
but
they
had
wanted
him
since
or
so
to
show
they
could
cut
the
mustard
i
guess
al
bradley
and
his
brother
george
hit
six
or
seven
banks
across
the
midwest
and
then
kidnapped
a
banker
for
ransom
the
ransom
was
paid
thirty
thousand
dollars
a
big
sum
for
those
days
but
they
killed
the
banker
anyway
by
then
the
midwest
had
gotten
a
little
toasty
for
the
gangs
that
ran
there
so
al
and
george
and
their
litter
of
ratlings
run
northeast
up
this
way
they
rented
themselves
a
big
farmhouse
just
over
the
town
line
in
newport
not
far
from
where
the
rhulin
farms
are
today
that
was
in
the
dogdays
of
maybe
july
maybe
august
maybe
even
early
september
i
don't
know
for
sure
just
when
there
were
eight
of
em
al
bradley
george
bradley
joe
conklin
and
his
brother
cal
an
irishman
named
arthur
malloy
who
was
called
creeping
jesus
malloy
because
he
was
nearsighted
but
wouldn't
put
on
his
specs
unless
he
absolutely
had
to
and
patrick
caudy
a
young
fellow
from
chicago
who
was
said
to
be
kill
crazy
but
as
handsome
as
adonis
there
were
also
two
women
with
them
kitty
donahue
george
bradley
commonlaw
wife
and
marie
hauser
who
belonged
to
caudy
but
sometimes
got
passed
around
according
to
the
stories
we
all
heard
later
they
made
one
bad
assumption
when
they
got
up
here
sonny
they
got
the
idea
they
were
so
far
away
from
indiana
that
they
were
safe
they
laid
low
for
awhile
and
then
got
bored
and
decided
they
wanted
to
go
hunting
they
had
plenty
of
firepower
but
they
were
a
bit
low
on
ammunition
so
they
all
came
nto
derry
on
the
seventh
of
october
in
two
cars
patrick
gaudy
took
the
women
around
shopping
while
the
other
men
went
into
machen
sporting
goods
kitty
donahue
bought
a
dress
in
freese
and
she
died
in
it
two
days
later
lal
machen
waited
on
the
men
himself
he
died
in
too
fat
he
was
always
too
fat
but
there
wasn't
nothing
wrong
with
his
eyes
and
he
knew
it
was
al
bradley
the
minute
he
walked
in
he
said
he
thought
he
recognized
some
of
the
others
but
he
wasn't
sure
of
malloy
until
he
put
on
his
specs
to
look
at
a
display
of
knives
in
a
glass
case
al
bradley
walked
up
to
him
and
said
we'd
like
to
buy
some
ammunition
wel
lal
machen
says
you
come
to
the
right
place
bradley
handed
him
a
paper
and
lal
read
it
over
the
paper
has
been
lost
at
least
so
far
as
i
know
but
lal
said
it
would
have
turned
your
blood
cold
they
wanted
five
hundred
rounds
of
.caliber
ammunition
eight
hundred
rounds
of
.caliber
sixty
rounds
of
.caliber
which
they
don't
even
make
anymore
shotgun
shells
loaded
both
with
buck
and
bird
and
a
thousand
rounds
each
of
short
and
longrifle
plus
get
this
sixteen
thousand
rounds
of
machinegun
bullets
holy
shit
i
said
mr
keene
smiled
that
cynical
smile
again
and
offered
me
the
apothecary
jar
at
first
i
shook
my
head
and
then
i
took
another
whip
this
here
is
quite
a
shopping
list
boys
lal
says
come
on
al
creeping
jesus
malloy
says
i
told
you
we
wasn't
going
to
get
it
in
a
hick
town
like
this
let
go
on
up
to
bangor
they
won't
have
nothing
there
either
but
i
can
use
a
ride
now
hold
your
horses
lal
says
just
as
cool
as
a
cucumber
this
here
is
one
hell
of
a
good
order
and
i
wouldn't
want
to
lose
it
to
that
jew
up
bangor
i
can
give
you
the
.s
right
now
also
the
bird
and
half
the
buck
i
can
give
you
a
hundred
rounds
each
of
the
and
.caliber
too
i
could
have
the
rest
for
you
and
here
lal
sort
of
halfclosed
his
eyes
and
tapped
his
chin
as
if
calculating
it
out
by
day
after
tomorrow
how'd
that
be
bradley
grinned
like
he'd
split
his
head
around
the
back
and
said
it
sounded
just
as
fine
as
paint
cal
conklin
said
he'd
still
like
to
go
on
up
to
bangor
but
he
was
outvoted
now
if
you're
not
sure
you
can
make
good
on
this
order
you
ought
to
say
so
right
now”
al
bradley
says
to
lal
because
i'm
a
pretty
fine
fellow
but
when
i
get
mad
you
don't
want
to
get
into
a
pissing
contest
with
me
you
follow
i
do
lal
says
and
i'll
have
all
the
ammo
you
could
want
mr
rader
brady
says
richard
d
rader
at
your
service
he
stuck
out
his
hand
and
lal
pumped
it
grinning
all
the
while
real
pleased
mr
rader
so
then
bradley
asked
him
what
would
be
a
good
time
for
him
ad
his
friends
to
drop
by
and
pick
up
the
goods
and
lal
machen
asked
them
right
back
how
two
in
the
afternoon
sounded
to
them
they
agreed
that
would
be
fine
out
they
went
lal
watched
them
go
they
met
the
two
women
and
gaudy
on
the
sidewalk
outside
lal
recognized
gaudy
too
so
mr
keene
said
looking
at
me
brighteyed
what
do
you
think
lal
done
then
called
the
cops
i
guess
he
didn't
i
said
based
on
what
happened
me
i
would
have
broken
my
leg
getting
to
the
telephone
well
maybe
you
would
and
maybe
you
wouldn't
mr
keene
said
with
that
same
cynical
brighteyed
smile
and
i
shivered
because
i
knew
what
he
meant
and
he
knew
i
knew
once
something
heavy
begins
to
roll
it
can't
be
stopped
it
simply
going
to
roll
unti
it
finds
a
flat
place
long
enough
to
wear
away
all
of
its
forward
motion
you
can
stand
in
front
of
that
thing
and
get
flattened
but
that
won't
stop
it
either
maybe
you
would
have
and
maybe
you
wouldn't
mr
keene
repeated
but
i
can
tell
pu
what
lal
machen
did
the
rest
of
that
day
and
all
of
the
next
when
someone
he
knew
came
in
some
man
why
he
would
tell
them
that
he
knew
who
had
been
out
in
the
woods
around
the
newportderry
line
shooting
at
deer
and
grouse
and
god
knows
what
else
with
kansas
city
typewriters
it
was
the
bradley
gang
he
knew
for
a
fact
because
he
had
recognized
em
he'd
tell
em
that
bradley
and
his
men
were
coming
back
the
next
day
around
two
to
pick
up
the
rest
of
their
order
he'd
tell
them
he'd
promised
bradley
all
the
ammunition
he
could
want
and
that
was
a
promise
he
intended
to
keep
how
many
i
asked
i
felt
hypnotized
by
his
glittering
eye
suddenly
the
dry
smell
of
this
back
room
the
smell
of
prescription
drugs
and
powders
of
musterole
and
vicks
vaporub
and
robitussin
cough
syrup
suddenly
all
those
smells
seemed
suffocating
but
i
could
no
more
have
left
than
i
could
kill
myself
by
holding
my
breath
how
many
men
did
lal
pass
the
word
to
mr
keene
asked
i
nodded
don't
know
for
sure
mr
keene
said
didn't
stand
right
there
and
take
up
sentry
duty
all
those
he
felt
he
could
trust
i
suppose
those
he
could
trust
i
mused
my
voice
was
a
little
hoarse
ayu
mr
keene
said
derrymen
you
know
not
that
many
of
em
raised
cows
he
laughed
at
this
old
joke
before
going
on
i
came
in
around
ten
the
day
after
the
bradleys
first
dropped
in
on
lal
he
told
me
the
story
then
asked
how
he
could
help
me
i'd
only
come
in
to
see
if
my
last
roll
of
pictures
had
been
developed
in
those
days
machen
handled
all
the
kodak
films
and
cameras
but
after
i
got
my
photos
i
also
said
i
could
use
some
ammo
for
my
winchester
™you
gonna
shoot
some
game
norb
lal
asks
me
passing
over
the
shells
might
plug
some
varmmts
i
said
and
we
had
us
a
chuckle
over
that
mr
keene
laughed
and
slapped
his
skinny
leg
as
if
this
was
still
the
best
joke
he
had
ever
heard
he
leaned
forward
and
tapped
my
knee
all
i
mean
son
is
that
the
story
got
around
all
it
needed
to
small
towns
you
know
if
you
tell
the
right
people
what
you
need
to
pass
along
will
get
along
see
what
i
mean
like
another
licorice
whip
i
took
one
with
numb
fingers
make
you
fat
mr
keene
said
and
cackled
he
looked
old
then
infinitely
old
with
his
bifocals
slipping
down
the
gaunt
blade
of
his
nose
and
the
skin
stretched
too
tight
and
thin
across
his
cheeks
to
wrinkle
the
next
day
i
brought
my
rifle
into
the
store
with
me
and
bob
tanner
who
worked
harder
than
any
assistant
i
ever
had
after
him
brought
in
his
pop
shotgun
around
eleven
that
day
gregory
cole
came
in
for
a
bicarb
of
soda
and
damned
if
he
didn't
have
a
colt
jammed
right
in
his
belt
don't
blow
your
balls
off
with
that
greg
i
said
i
come
out
of
the
woods
all
the
way
from
milford
for
this
and
i
got
one
fuck
of
a
hangover
greg
says
i
guess
i'll
blow
someone
balls
off
before
the
sun
goes
down
around
onethirty
i
put
the
little
sign
i
had
be
back
soon
please
be
patient
in
the
door
and
took
my
rifle
and
walked
out
the
back
into
richard
alley
i
asked
bob
tanner
if
he
wanted
to
come
along
and
he
said
he'd
better
finish
filling
mrs
emerson
prescription
and
he'd
see
me
later
leave
me
a
live
one
mr
keene
he
said
but
i
allowed
as
how
i
couldn't
promise
nothing
there
was
hardly
any
traffic
on
canal
street
at
all
either
on
foot
or
by
car
every
now
and
then
a
delivery
truck
would
pass
but
that
was
about
all
i
saw
jake
pinnette
cross
over
and
he
had
a
rifle
in
each
hand
he
met
andy
criss
and
they
walked
over
to
one
of
the
benches
that
used
to
stand
where
the
war
memorial
was
you
know
where
the
canal
goes
underground
petie
vanness
and
al
nell
and
jimmy
gordon
were
all
sitting
on
the
courthouse
steps
eating
sandwiches
and
fruit
out
of
their
dinnerbuckets
trading
with
each
other
for
stuff
that
looked
better
to
them
the
way
kids
do
on
the
schoolyard
they
was
all
armed
jimmy
gordon
had
himself
a
world
war
i
springfield
that
looked
bigger
than
he
did
i
see
a
kd
go
walking
toward
upmile
hill
i
think
maybe
it
was
zack
denbrough
the
father
of
your
old
buddy
the
one
who
turned
out
to
be
a
writer
and
kenny
borton
says
from
the
window
of
the
christian
science
reading
room
you
want
to
get
out
of
here
kid
there
going
to
be
shooting.”
zack
took
one
look
at
his
face
and
ran
like
hell
there
were
men
everywhere
men
with
guns
standing
in
doorways
and
sitting
on
steps
and
looking
out
of
windows
greg
cole
was
sitting
in
a
doorway
down
the
street
with
his
in
his
lap
and
about
two
dozen
shells
lined
up
beside
him
like
toy
sojers
bruce
jagermeyer
and
that
swede
olaf
theramenius
were
standing
underneath
the
marquee
of
the
bijou
in
the
shade
mr
keene
looked
at
me
through
me
his
eyes
were
not
sharp
now
they
were
hazy
with
memory
soft
as
the
eyes
of
a
man
only
become
when
he
is
remembering
one
of
the
best
times
of
his
life
the
first
home
run
he
ever
hit
maybe
or
the
first
trout
he
ever
landed
that
was
big
enough
to
keep
or
the
first
time
he
ever
lay
with
a
willing
woman
i
remember
i
heard
the
wind
sonny
he
said
dreamily
i
remember
hearing
the
wind
hearing
the
courthouse
clock
toll
two
bob
tanner
came
up
behind
me
and
i
was
so
tight
wired
i
almost
blew
his
head
off
he
only
nodded
at
me
and
crossed
over
to
vannock
dry
goods
trailing
his
shadow
out
behind
him
you
would
have
thought
that
when
it
got
to
be
twoten
and
nothing
happened
then
two
fifteen
then
twotwenty
folks
would
have
just
up
and
left
wouldn't
you
but
it
didn't
happen
that
way
at
all
people
just
kept
their
place
because
because
you
knew
they
were
going
to
come
didn't
you
i
asked
there
was
never
any
question
at
all
he
beamed
at
me
like
a
teacher
pleased
with
a
student
recital
that
right
he
said
we
knew
no
one
had
to
talk
about
it
no
one
had
to
say
wellnow
let
wait
until
twenty
past
and
if
they
don't
show
i've
got
to
get
back
to
work
things
just
stayed
quiet
and
around
two
twentyfive
that
afternoon
these
two
cars
me
red
and
one
dark
blue
started
down
up
mile
hill
and
came
into
the
intersection
one
of
them
was
a
chevrolet
and
the
other
was
a
la
salle
the
conklin
brothers
patrick
caudy
and
marie
hauser
were
in
the
chevrolet
the
bradleys
malloy
and
kitty
donahue
were
in
the
la
salle
they
started
through
the
intersection
okay
and
then
al
bradley
slammed
on
the
brakes
of
that
la
salle
so
sudden
that
caudy
damn
near
ran
into
him
the
street
was
too
quiet
and
bradley
knew
it
he
wasn't
nothing
but
an
animal
but
it
doesn't
take
much
to
put
up
an
animal
wind
when
it
been
chased
like
a
weasel
in
the
corn
for
four
years
he
opened
the
door
of
the
la
salle
and
stood
up
on
the
running
board
for
a
moment
he
looked
around
then
he
made
a
goback
gesture
to
caudy
with
his
hand
caudy
said
what
boss
i
heard
that
plain
as
day
the
only
thing
i
heard
any
of
them
say
that
day
there
was
a
wink
of
sun
too
i
remember
that
it
came
off
a
compact
mirror
the
hauser
woman
was
powdering
her
nose
that
was
when
lal
machen
and
his
helper
biff
marlow
came
running
out
of
machen
store
put
em
up
bradley
you're
surrounded
lal
shouts
and
before
bradley
could
do
more
than
turn
his
head
lal
started
blasting
he
was
wild
at
first
but
then
he
put
one
into
pradley
shoulder
the
claret
started
to
pour
out
of
that
hole
right
away
bradley
caught
hold
of
the
la
salle
doorpost
and
swung
himself
back
into
the
car
he
threw
it
into
gear
and
that
when
everyone
started
to
shoot
tt
was
all
over
in
four
naybe
five
minutes
but
it
seemed
a
whole
hell
of
a
lot
longer
while
it
was
happening
petie
and
al
and
jimmy
gordon
just
sat
there
on
the
courthouse
steps
and
poured
bullets
into
the
back
end
of
the
chevrolet
i
saw
bob
tanner
down
on
one
knee
firing
and
working
the
bolt
on
that
old
rifle
of
his
like
a
madman
jagermeyer
and
theramenius
were
shooting
into
the
nght
side
of
the
la
salle
from
under
the
theater
marquee
and
greg
cole
stood
in
the
gutter
holding
that
automatic
out
in
both
hands
pulling
the
trigger
just
as
fast
as
he
could
work
it
there
must
have
been
fifty
sixty
men
firing
all
at
once
after
it
was
all
over
lal
machen
dug
thirtysix
slugs
out
of
the
brick
sides
of
his
store
and
that
was
three
days
later
after
just
about
everydamnbody
in
town
who
wanted
one
for
a
souvenir
had
come
down
and
dug
one
out
with
his
penknife
when
it
was
at
its
worst
it
sounded
like
the
battle
of
the
marne
windows
were
blown
in
by
rifle
fire
all
around
machen
bradley
got
the
la
salle
around
in
a
half
circle
and
he
wasn't
slow
but
by
the
time
he'd
done
he
was
running
on
four
flats
both
the
headlights
were
blowed
out
and
the
windscreen
was
gone
creeping
jesus
malloy
and
george
bradley
were
each
at
a
backseat
window
firing
pistols
i
seen
one
bullet
take
malloy
high
up
in
the
neck
and
tear
it
wide
open
he
shot
twice
more
and
then
collapsed
out
the
window
with
his
arms
hanging
down
gaudy
tried
to
turn
the
chevrolet
and
only
ran
into
the
back
end
of
bradley
la
salle
that
was
really
the
end
of
em
right
there
son
the
chevrolet
front
bumper
locked
with
the
la
salle
back
one
and
there
went
any
chance
they
might
have
had
to
make
a
run
for
it
joe
conklin
got
out
of
the
back
seat
and
just
stood
there
in
the
middle
of
the
intersection
a
pistol
in
each
hand
and
started
to
pour
it
on
he
was
shooting
at
jake
pinnette
and
andy
criss
the
two
of
them
fell
off
the
bench
they'd
been
sitting
on
and
landed
in
the
grass
andy
criss
shouting
i'm
killed
i'm
killed
over
and
over
again
although
he
was
never
so
much
as
touched
neither
of
them
were
joe
conklin
he
had
time
to
fire
both
his
guns
empty
before
anything
so
much
as
touched
him
his
coat
flew
back
and
his
pants
twitched
like
some
woman
you
couldn't
see
was
stitching
on
them
he
was
wearing
a
straw
hat
and
it
flew
off
his
head
so
you
could
see
how
he'd
centerparted
his
hair
he
had
one
of
his
guns
under
his
arm
and
was
trying
to
reload
the
other
when
someone
cut
the
legs
out
from
under
him
and
he
went
down
kenny
borton
claimed
him
later
but
there
was
really
no
way
to
tell
could
have
been
anybody
conklin
brother
cal
came
out
after
him
soon
joe
fell
and
down
he
went
like
a
ton
of
bricks
with
a
hole
in
his
head
marie
hauser
came
out
maybe
she
was
trying
to
surrender
i
dunno
she
still
had
the
compact
she'd
been
using
to
powder
her
nose
in
her
right
hand
she
was
screaming
i
believe
but
by
then
it
was
hard
to
hear
bullets
was
flying
all
around
them
that
compact
mirror
was
blown
right
out
of
her
hand
she
started
back
to
the
car
then
but
she
took
one
in
the
hip
she
made
it
somehow
and
managed
to
crawl
inside
again
al
bradley
revved
the
la
salle
up
just
as
high
as
it
would
go
and
managed
to
get
it
moving
again
he
dragged
the
chevrolet
maybe
ten
feet
before
the
bumper
tore
right
off
n
it
the
boys
poured
lead
into
it
all
the
windows
was
busted
one
of
the
mudguards
was
laying
in
the
street
malloy
was
dead
hanging
out
the
window
but
both
of
the
bradley
brothers
were
still
alive
george
was
firing
from
the
back
seat
his
woman
was
dead
beside
him
with
one
of
her
eyes
shot
out
al
bradley
got
to
the
big
intersection
then
his
auto
mounted
the
curb
and
stopped
there
he
got
out
from
behind
the
wheel
and
started
running
up
canal
street
he
was
riddled
patrick
gaudy
got
out
of
the
chevrolet
looked
as
if
he
was
going
to
surrender
for
a
minute
then
he
grabbed
a
from
a
cheaterholster
under
his
armpit
he
triggered
it
off
maybe
three
times
just
firing
wild
and
then
his
shirt
blew
back
from
his
chest
in
flames
he
slid
down
the
side
of
the
chevy
until
he
was
sitting
on
the
running
board
he
shot
one
more
time
and
so
far
as
i
know
that
was
the
only
bullet
that
hit
anyone
it
ricocheted
off
something
and
then
grazed
across
the
back
of
greg
cole
hand
left
a
scar
he
used
to
show
off
when
he
was
drunk
until
someone
al
nell
maybe
took
him
aside
and
told
him
it
might
be
a
good
idea
to
shut
up
about
what
happened
to
the
bradley
gang
the
hauser
woman
came
out
and
that
time
wasn't
any
doubt
she
was
trying
to
surrender
she
had
her
hands
up
maybe
no
one
really
meant
to
kill
her
but
by
then
there
was
a
crossfire
and
she
walked
right
into
it
george
bradley
run
as
far
as
that
bench
by
the
war
memorial
then
someone
pulped
the
back
of
his
head
with
a
shotgun
blast
he
fell
down
dead
with
his
pants
full
of
piss

hardly
aware
i
was
doing
it
i
took
a
licorice
whip
from
the
jar
they
went
on
pouring
rounds
into
those
cars
for
another
minute
or
so
before
it
began
to
taper
off
mr
keene
said
when
men
get
then
blood
up
it
doesn't
go
down
easy
that
was
when
i
looked
around
and
saw
sheriff
sullivan
behind
nell
and
the
others
on
the
courthouse
steps
putting
rounds
through
that
dead
chevy
with
a
remington
pump
don't
let
anyone
tell
you
he
wasn't
there
norbert
keene
is
sitting
in
front
of
you
and
telling
you
he
was
by
the
time
the
firing
stopped
those
cars
didn't
look
like
cars
at
all
anymore
just
hunks
of
junk
with
glass
around
them
men
started
to
walk
over
to
them
no
one
talked
all
you
could
hear
was
the
wind
and
feet
gritting
over
broken
glass
that
when
the
picturetaking
started
and
you
ought
to
know
this
sonny
when
the
picturetaking
starts
the
story
is
over
mr
keene
rocked
in
his
chair
his
sippers
bumping
placidly
on
the
floor
looking
at
me
there
nothing
like
that
in
the
derry
news
was
all
i
could
think
of
to
say
the
headline
for
that
day
had
read
state
police
fbi
gun
down
bradley
gang
in
pitched
battle
with
the
subhead
local
police
lend
support
course
not
mr
keene
said
laughing
delightedly
i
seen
the
publisher
mack
laughlin
put
two
rounds
into
joe
conklin
himself
christ
i
muttered
get
enough
licorice
sonny
got
enough
i
said
i
licked
my
lips
mr
keene
how
could
a
thing
of
that
that
magnitude
be
covered
up
wasn't
no
coverup
he
said
looking
honestly
surprised
it
was
just
that
no
one
talked
about
it
much
and
really
who
cared
it
wasn't
president
and
mrs
hoover
that
went
down
that
day
it
was
no
worse
than
shooting
mad
dogs
that
would
kill
you
with
a
bite
if
you
give
them
half
a
chance
but
the
women
couple
of
whores
he
said
indifferently
besides
it
happened
in
derry
not
in
new
york
or
chicago
the
place
makes
it
news
as
much
as
what
happened
in
the
place
sonny
that
why
there
are
bigger
headlines
when
an
earthquake
kills
twelve
people
in
los
angeles
than
there
are
when
one
kills
three
thousand
in
some
heathen
country
in
the
mideast
besides
it
happened
in
derry
i've
heard
it
before
and
i
suppose
if
i
continue
to
pursue
this
i'll
hear
it
again
and
again
and
again
they
say
it
as
if
speaking
patiently
to
a
mental
defective
they
say
it
the
way
they
would
say
because
of
gravity
if
you
asked
them
how
come
you
stick
to
the
ground
when
you
walk
they
say
it
as
if
it
were
a
natural
law
any
natural
man
should
understand
and
of
course
the
worst
of
that
is
ido
understand
i
had
one
more
question
for
norbert
keene
did
you
see
anyone
at
all
that
day
that
you
didn't
recognize
once
the
shooting
started
mr
keene
answer
was
quick
enough
to
drop
my
blood
temperature
ten
degrees
or
so
it
felt
the
clown
you
mean
how
did
you
find
out
about
him
sonny
oh
i
heard
it
somewher
i
said
only
caught
a
glimpse
of
him
once
things
got
hot
i
tended
pretty
much
to
my
own
knittin
i
glanced
around
just
once
and
saw
him
upstreet
beyond
them
swedes
under
the
bijou
marquee
mr
keene
said
he
wasn't
wearing
aclown
suit
or
nothing
like
that
he
was
dressed
in
a
pair
of
farmer
biballs
and
a
cotton
shirt
underneath
but
his
face
was
covered
with
that
white
greasepaint
they
use
and
he
had
a
big
red
clown
smile
painted
on
also
had
these
tufts
of
fake
hair
you
know
orange
sorta
comical
lal
machen
never
saw
that
fellow
but
biff
did
only
biff
must
have
been
confused
because
he
thought
he
saw
him
in
one
of
the
windows
of
an
apartment
over
somewhere
to
the
left
and
once
when
i
asked
jimmy
gordon
he
was
killed
in
pearl
harbor
you
know
went
down
with
his
ship
the
california
i
think
it
was
he
said
he
saw
the
guy
behind
the
war
memorial
mr
keene
shook
his
head
smiling
a
little
tts
funny
how
people
get
during
a
thing
like
that
and
even
funnier
what
they
remember
after
it
all
over
you
can
listen
to
sixteen
different
tales
and
no
two
of
them
will
jibe
together
take
the
gun
that
clown
fellow
had
for
instance
gu
i
asked
he
was
shooting
too
ayuh
mr
keene
said
the
one
glimpse
i
caught
of
him
it
looked
like
he
had
a
winchester
boltaction
and
it
wasn't
until
later
that
i
figured
out
i
must
have
thought
that
because
that
what
z
had
biff
marlow
thought
he
had
a
remington
because
that
was
what
he
had
and
when
[asked
jimmy
about
it
he
said
that
guy
was
shooting
an
old
springfield
just
like
his
funny
huh
funny
i
managed
mr
keene
didn't
any
of
you
wonder
what
in
hell
a
clown
especially
one
in
farmer
biballs
was
doing
there
just
then
sure
mr
keene
said
it
wasn't
no
big
deal
you
understand
but
sure
we
wondered
most
of
us
figured
it
was
somebody
who
wanted
to
attend
the
party
but
didn't
want
to
be
recognized
a
town
council
member
maybe
horst
mueller
maybe
or
even
trace
naugkr
who
was
mayor
back
then
or
it
could
just
have
been
a
professional
man
who
didn't
want
to
be
recognized
a
doctor
or
a
lawyer
i
wouldn't
ve
recognized
my
own
father
in
a
get
up
like
that
he
laughed
a
little
and
i
asked
him
what
was
funny
there
also
a
possibility
that
it
was
a
real
clow
he
said
back
in
the
twenties
and
thirties
the
county
fair
in
esty
came
a
lot
earlier
than
it
does
now
and
it
was
set
up
and
going
full
blast
the
week
that
the
bradley
gang
met
their
end
there
were
clowns
at
the
county
fair
maybe
one
of
them
heard
we
were
going
to
have
our
own
little
carnival
and
rode
down
because
he
wanted
to
be
in
on
it
he
smiled
at
me
dryly
tm
about
talked
out
he
said
but
i'll
tell
you
one
more
thing
since
you
pear
to
be
so
interested
and
you
listen
so
close
it
was
something
biff
marlow
said
about
sixteen
years
later
when
we
were
having
a
few
beers
up
to
pilot
in
bangor
right
out
of
a
clear
blue
sky
he
said
it
said
that
clown
was
leanin
out
of
the
window
so
far
that
biff
couldn't
believe
he
wasn't
fallin
out
it
wasn't
just
his
head
and
shoulders
and
arms
that
was
out
biff
said
he
was
right
out
to
the
knees
hanging
there
in
midair
shooting
down
at
the
cars
the
bradleys
had
come
in
with
that
big
red
grin
on
his
face
he
was
tricked
out
like
a
jackolantern
that
had
got
a
bad
scare
was
how
biff
put
it
like
he
was
floating
i
said
ayu
mr
keene
agreed
and
biff
said
there
was
something
else
something
that
bothered
him
for
weeks
afterward
one
of
those
things
you
get
right
on
the
tip
of
your
tongue
but
won't
quite
come
off
or
something
that
lights
on
your
skin
like
a
mosquito
or
a
noseeum
he
said
he
finally
figured
out
what
it
was
one
night
when
he
had
to
get
up
and
tap
a
kidney
he
stood
there
whizzing
into
the
bowl
thinking
of
nothing
in
particular
when
it
come
to
him
all
at
once
that
it
was
twotwentyfive
in
the
afternoon
when
the
shooting
started
and
the
sun
was
out
but
that
clown
didn't
cast
any
shadow
no
shadow
at
all
part
july
of
you
lethargic
waiting
upon
me

the

and
punches
the

lightly
on
the
shoulder
come
on
ugl
she
says
and
giggles
when
she
does
this
she
is
transformed
from
a
pretty
mildly
desirable
highschool
junior
into
the
coltish
notquitegawky
elevenyearold
that
beverly
marsh
had
been
and
as
they
pass
him
bill
is
shaken
by
her
beauty
and
he
feels
fear
he
wants
to
go
to
the
boy
and
tell
him
earnestly
that
he
must
go
home
by
well
lighted
streets
and
not
look
around
if
someone
speaks
you
can't
be
careful
on
a
skateboard
mister
a
phantom
voice
says
inside
his
head
and
bill
smiles
a
rueful
grownup
smile
he
watches
the
boy
open
the
door
for
his
girl
they
go
into
the
vestibule
moving
closer
together
and
bill
would
have
bet
the
royalties
of
the
book
the
boy
named
billy
is
holding
under
his
arm
that
he
has
stolen
a
kiss
before
opening
the
outer
door
for
the
girl
more
fool
you
if
you
didn't
billy
my
man
he
thinks
now
see
her
home
safe
for
christ
sake
see
her
home
safe
mike
calls
be
right
with
you
big
bill
just
let
me
file
this
bill
nods
and
crosses
his
legs
the
paper
bag
on
his
lap
crackles
a
little
there
a
pint
of
bourbon
inside
and
he
reckons
he
has
never
wanted
a
drink
so
badly
in
his
life
as
he
does
right
now
mike
will
be
able
to
supply
water
if
not
ice
and
the
way
he
feels
right
now
a
very
little
water
will
be
enough
he
thinks
of
silver
leaning
against
the
wall
of
mike
garage
on
palmer
lane
and
from
that
his
thoughts
progress
naturally
to
the
day
they
had
met
in
the
barrens
all
except
mike
and
each
had
told
his
tale
again
lepers
under
porches
mummies
who
walked
on
the
ice
blood
from
drains
and
dead
boys
in
the
standpipe
and
pictures
that
moved
and
werewolves
that
chased
small
boys
down
deserted
streets
they
had
gone
deeper
into
the
barrens
that
day
before
the
fourth
of
july
he
remembers
now
it
had
been
hot
in
town
but
cool
in
the
tangled
shade
on
the
eastern
bank
of
the
kenduskeag
he
remembers
one
of
those
concrete
cylinders
not
far
away
humming
to
itself
the
way
the
xerox
machine
had
hummed
for
the
pretty
highschool
girl
just
now
bill
remembers
that
and
how
when
all
the
stories
were
done
the
others
had
looked
at
him
they
had
wanted
him
to
tell
them
what
they
should
do
next
how
they
should
proceed
and
he
simply
didn't
know
the
not
knowing
had
filled
him
with
a
kind
of
desperation
looking
at
mike
shadow
now
looming
large
on
the
darkly
paneled
wall
in
the
reference
room
a
sudden
sureness
comes
to
him
he
hadn't
known
then
because
they
hadn't
been
complete
when
they
met
that
july
rd
afternoon
the
completion
had
come
later
at
the
abandoned
gravelpit
beyond
the
dump
where
you
could
climb
out
of
the
barrens
easily
on
either
side
kansas
street
or
merit
street
right
around
in
fact
where
the
interstate
overpass
was
now
the
gravelpit
had
no
name
it
was
old
its
crumbly
sides
crabby
with
weeds
and
bushes
there
had
still
been
plenty
of
ammunition
there
more
than
enough
for
an
apocalyptic
rockfight
but
before
that
on
the
bank
of
the
kenduskeag
he
hadn't
been
sure
what
to
say
what
did
they
want
him
to
say
what
did
he
want
to
say
he
remembers
looking
from
one
face
to
the
next
ben
bev
eddie
stan
richie
and
he
remembers
music
little
richard
whompbompalompbomp
music
low
and
darts
of
light
in
his
eyes
he
remembers
the
darts
of
light
because
richie
had
hung
his
transistor
radio
over
the
lowermost
branch
of
the
tree
he
was
leaning
against
although
they
were
in
the
shade
the
sun
bounced
off
the
surface
of
the
kenduskeag
onto
the
radio
chrome
facing
and
from
there
into
bill
eyes
ttake
that
th
hing
dddown
ruhruhrichi
bill
said
it
gonna
bunblind
m
m
me
sure
big
bill
richie
said
at
once
with
no
smartmouth
at
all
and
removed
the
radio
from
the
branch
he
also
turned
it
off
and
bill
wished
he
hadn't
done
that
it
made
the
silence
broken
only
by
the
rippling
water
and
the
vague
hum
of
the
sewagepumping
machinery
seem
very
loud
their
eyes
watched
him
and
he
wanted
to
tell
them
to
look
somewhere
else
what
did
they
think
he
was
a
freak
but
of
course
he
couldn't
do
that
because
all
they
were
doing
was
waiting
for
him
to
tell
them
what
to
do
now
they
had
come
by
dreadful
knowledge
and
they
needed
him
to
tell
them
what
to
do
with
it
why
me
he
wanted
to
shout
at
them
but
of
course
he
knew
that
too
it
was
because
like
it
or
mt
he
had
been
tapped
for
the
position
because
he
was
the
idea
man
because
he
had
lost
a
brother
to
whatever
it
was
but
most
of
all
because
he
had
become
in
some
obscure
way
he
would
never
completely
understand
big
bill
he
glanced
at
beverly
and
looked
away
quickly
from
the
calm
trust
in
her
eyes
looking
at
beverly
made
him
feel
funny
in
the
pit
of
his
stomach
fluttery
we
cuhcan't
go
to
the
pppolic
he
said
at
last
his
voice
sounded
harsh
to
his
own
ears
too
loud
we
ccahan't
ggo
to
our
puhhuhharents
either
unless
he
looked
hopefully
at
richie
what
aaabout
your
mmom
and
ddad
foureyes
they
suhheem
ppretty
reh
reh
regular
my
good
man
richie
said
in
his
toodles
the
butler
voice
you
obviously
have
no
understahnding
whatsoevah
of
my
mater
and
pater
they
talk
american
richi
eddie
said
from
his
spot
by
ben
he
was
sitting
by
ben
for
the
simple
reason
that
ben
provided
enough
shade
for
eddie
to
sit
in
his
face
looked
small
and
pinched
and
worried
an
old
man’s
face
his
aspirator
was
in
his
right
hand
they'd
think
i
was
ready
for
juniper
hill
richie
said
he
was
wearing
an
old
pair
of
glasses
today
the
day
before
a
friend
of
henry
bowers
named
card
jagermeyer
had
come
up
behind
richie
as
richie
left
the
derry
ice
cream
bar
with
a
pistachio
cone
tag
you're
it
this
jagermeyer
who
outweighed
richie
by
forty
pounds
or
so
screamed
and
slammed
richie
full
in
the
back
with
both
hands
laced
together
richie
flew
into
the
gutter
losing
his
glasses
and
his
icecream
cone
the
left
lens
of
his
glasses
had
shattered
and
his
mother
was
furious
with
him
about
it
lending
very
little
credence
to
richie
explanations
all
i
know
is
that
it
was
a
lot
of
fooling
around
she
had
sad
honestly
richie
do
you
think
there
a
glassestree
somewhere
and
we
can
just
pull
off
a
new
pair
of
spectacles
for
you
whenever
you
break
the
old
pair
but
mom
this
kid
pushed
me
he
came
up
behind
me
this
big
kid
and
pushed
me
richie
vas
by
then
near
tears
this
failure
to
make
his
mother
understand
hurt
much
worse
than
being
slammed
into
the
gutter
by
card
jagermeyer
who
was
so
stupid
they
hadn't
even
bothered
to
send
him
to
summer
school
don't
want
to
hear
any
more
about
it
maggie
tozier
said
flatly
but
the
next
time
you
see
your
father
come
in
looking
whipped
after
working
late
three
nights
in
a
row
you
think
a
little
bit
richie
you
think
about
it
but
mom
no
more
i
said
her
voice
was
curt
and
final
worse
it
was
near
tears
she
left
the
room
then
and
the
tv
went
on
much
too
loud
richie
had
been
left
alone
sitting
miserably
at
the
kitchen
table
it
was
this
memory
that
caused
richie
to
shake
his
head
again
my
folks
are
okay
but
they'd
never
believe
something
like
this
w
what
aaabout
other
kih
kids
and
they
looked
around
bill
would
remember
years
later
as
if
for
someone
who
wasn't
there
wh
stan
asked
doubtfully
i
can't
think
of
anyone
else
i
trust
just
the
suhsuhsame
bill
said
in
a
troubled
voice
and
a
little
silence
fell
among
them
while
bill
thought
about
what
to
say
next
if
asked
ben
hanscom
would
have
told
you
that
henry
bowers
hated
him
more
than
any
of
the
others
in
the
loser
club
because
of
what
had
happened
that
day
when
he
and
henry
had
shot
the
chutes
down
into
the
barrens
from
kansas
street
because
of
what
had
happened
the
day
he
and
richie
and
beverly
escaped
from
the
aladdin
but
most
of
all
because
by
not
allowing
henry
to
copy
during
examinations
he
had
caused
henry
to
be
sent
to
summerschool
and
incur
the
wrath
of
his
father
the
reputedly
insane
butch
bowers
if
asked
richie
tozier
would
have
told
you
henry
hated
him
more
than
any
of
the
others
because
of
the
day
he
had
fooled
henry
and
his
two
other
musketeers
in
freese
stan
uris
would
have
told
you
that
henry
hated
him
most
of
all
because
he
was
a
jew
when
stan
had
been
in
the
third
grade
and
henry
the
fifth
henry
had
once
washed
stan
face
with
snow
until
it
bled
and
he
was
screaming
hysterically
with
pain
and
fear
bill
denbrough
believed
that
henry
hated
him
the
most
because
he
was
skinny
because
he
stuttered
and
because
he
liked
to
dress
well
‘lllook
at
the
fff
fucking
puhpuhpans
henry
had
cried
when
the
derry
school
had
had
careers
day
in
april
and
bill
had
come
wearing
a
tie
before
the
day
was
over
the
tie
had
been
ripped
off
and
flung
into
a
tree
halfway
down
charter
street
he
did
hate
all
four
of
them
but
the
boy
in
derry
who
was
number
one
on
henry
personal
hate
parade
was
not
in
the
loser
club
at
all
on
that
july
rd
he
was
a
black
boy
named
michael
hanlon
who
lived
a
quarter
of
a
mile
down
the
road
from
the
shirttail
bowers
farm
henry
father
who
was
every
bit
as
crazy
as
he
was
reputed
to
be
was
oscar
butch
bowers
butch
bowers
associated
his
financial
physical
and
mental
decline
with
the
hanlon
family
in
general
and
with
mike
father
in
particular
will
hanlon
he
was
fond
of
telling
his
few
friends
and
his
son
had
had
him
thrown
in
the
county
jail
when
all
of
his
hanlon
chickens
died
so
he
could
get
the
insurance
money
don't
you
know
butch
would
say
eying
his
audience
with
all
the
baleful
interrupt
if
youdare
pugnacity
of
captain
billy
bones
in
the
admiral
benbow
he
got
some
of
his
friends
to
lie
him
up
and
that
why
i
had
to
sell
my
merc'ry
who
lied
him
up
daddy
henry
had
asked
when
he
was
eight
burning
at
the
injustice
that
had
been
done
to
his
father
he
thought
to
himself
that
when
he
was
a
grownup
he
would
find
liaruppers
and
coat
them
with
honey
and
stake
them
out
over
anthills
like
in
some
of
those
western
movies
they
showed
at
the
bijou
theater
on
saturday
afternoons
and
because
his
son
was
a
tireless
listener
although
if
asked
butch
would
have
maintained
that
was
only
as
it
should
be
bowers
senior
filled
his
son
ears
with
a
litany
of
hate
and
hard
luck
he
explained
to
his
son
that
while
all
niggers
were
stupid
some
were
cunning
as
well
and
down
deep
they
all
hated
white
men
and
wanted
to
plow
a
white
woman
furrow
maybe
it
wasn't
just
the
insurance
money
after
all
butch
said
maybe
hanlon
had
decided
to
lay
the
blame
for
the
dead
chickens
at
his
door
because
butch
had
the
next
produce
stand
down
the
road
he
done
it
anyway
and
that
was
just
as
sure
as
shit
sticks
to
a
blanket
he
done
it
and
then
got
a
bunch
of
white
nigger
bleeding
hearts
from
town
to
lie
him
up
and
threaten
butch
with
state
prison
if
he
didn't
pay
that
nigger
off
and
why
not
butch
would
ask
his
roundeyed
dirtynecked
silent
son
why
not
was
just
a
man
who
fought
the
japs
for
his
country
there
was
lots
of
guys
like
us
but
he
was
the
only
nigger
in
the
county
the
chicken
business
had
been
followed
by
one
unlucky
incident
after
another
his
deere
tractor
had
blown
a
rod
his
good
harrow
got
busted
in
the
north
field
he
got
a
boil
on
his
neck
which
became
infected
had
to
be
lanced
then
became
infected
again
and
had
to
be
removed
surgically
the
nigger
started
using
his
foully
gotten
money
to
undercut
butch
prices
so
they
lost
custom
in
henry
ears
it
was
a
constant
litany
the
nigger
the
nigger
the
nigger
everything
was
the
niggers
fault
the
nigger
had
a
nice
white
house
with
an
upstairs
and
an
oil
furnace
while
butch
and
his
wife
and
his
son
lived
in
what
was
not
much
better
than
a
tarpaper
shack
when
butch
couldn't
make
enough
money
farming
and
had
to
go
to
work
in
the
woods
for
awhile
it
was
the
nigger
fault
when
their
well
went
dry
in
it
was
the
nigger
fault
later
that
same
year
henry
who
was
then
ten
years
old
started
to
feed
mike
dog
mr
chips
old
stewbones
and
bags
of
potatochips
it
got
so
mr
chips
would
wag
his
tail
and
come
running
when
henry
called
when
the
dog
was
well
used
to
henry
and
henry
treats
henry
one
day
fed
him
a
pound
of
hamburger
laced
with
insect
poison
the
bugkiller
he
found
in
the
back
shed
he
had
saved
three
weeks
to
buy
the
meat
at
costello
mr
chips
ate
half
the
poisoned
meat
and
then
stopped
go
on
finish
your
treat
niggerdog
henry
had
said
mr
chips
wagged
his
tail
since
henry
had
called
him
this
from
the
beginning
he
believed
it
was
his
other
name
when
the
pains
started
henry
produced
a
piece
of
clothesline
and
tied
mr
chips
to
a
birch
so
he
couldn't
get
away
and
run
home
he
then
sat
on
a
flat
sun
warmed
rock
put
his
chin
in
his
palms
and
watched
the
dog
die
it
took
a
good
long
time
but
henry
considered
it
time
well
spent
at
the
end
mr
chips
began
to
convulse
and
a
thin
greenfoam
ran
from
between
his
jaws
how
do
you
like
that
niggerdog
henry
asked
it
and
it
rolled
its
dying
eyes
up
at
the
sound
of
henry
voice
and
tried
to
wag
its
tail
did
you
like
your
lunch
you
shitty
mutt
when
the
dog
was
dead
henry
removed
the
clothesline
went
home
and
told
his
father
what
he
had
done
oscar
bowers
was
extremely
crazy
by
that
time
a
year
later
his
wife
would
leave
him
after
he
beat
her
nearly
to
death
henry
was
likewise
frightened
of
his
father
and
felt
a
terrible
hate
for
him
sometimes
but
he
also
loved
him
and
that
afternoon
after
he
had
told
he
felt
he
had
finally
found
the
key
to
his
father
affections
because
his
father
had
clapped
him
on
the
back
so
hard
that
henry
almost
fell
over
taken
him
in
the
living
room
and
given
him
a
beer
it
was
the
first
beer
henry
had
ever
had
and
for
all
the
rest
of
his
years
he
would
associate
that
taste
with
positive
emotions
victory
and
love
here
to
a
good
job
well
done
henry
crazy
father
had
said
they
dicked
their
brown
bottles
together
and
drank
them
down
so
far
as
henry
knew
the
niggers
had
never
found
out
who
killed
their
dog
but
he
supposed
they
had
their
suspicions
he
hoped
they
did
the
others
in
the
losers
club
knew
mike
by
sight
in
a
town
where
he
was
the
only
negro
child
it
would
have
been
strange
if
they
had
not
but
that
was
all
because
mike
didn't
go
to
derry
elementary
school
his
mother
was
a
devout
baptist
and
mike
was
therefore
sent
to
the
neibolt
street
church
school
in
between
geography
reading
and
arithuaetic
there
were
bible
drills
lessons
on
such
subjects
as
the
meaning
of
the
ten
commandments
in
a
godless
world
and
discussiongroups
on
how
to
handle
everyday
moral
problems
if
you
saw
a
buddy
shoplifting
for
instance
or
heard
a
teacher
taking
the
name
of
god
in
vain
mike
thought
the
church
school
was
okay
there
were
times
when
he
suspected
in
a
vague
way
that
he
was
missing
some
things
a
wider
communication
with
kids
his
own
age
perhaps
but
he
was
willing
to
wait
until
high
school
for
these
things
to
happen
the
prospect
made
him
a
little
nervous
because
his
skin
was
brown
but
both
his
mother
and
father
had
been
well
treated
in
town
as
far
as
mike
could
see
and
mike
believed
he
would
be
treated
well
if
he
treated
others
the
same
way
the
exception
to
this
rule
of
course
was
henry
bowers
although
he
tried
to
show
it
as
little
as
possible
mike
went
in
constant
terror
of
henry
in
mike
was
slim
and
well
built
taller
than
stan
uris
but
not
quite
as
tall
as
bill
denbrough
he
was
fast
and
agile
and
that
had
saved
him
from
several
beatings
at
henry
hands
and
of
course
he
went
to
a
different
school
because
of
that
and
the
age
difference
their
paths
rarely
coincided
mike
took
pains
to
keep
things
that
way
so
the
irony
was
this
although
henry
hated
mike
hanlon
more
than
any
other
kid
in
derry
mike
had
been
the
least
hurt
of
any
of
them
oh
he
had
taken
his
lumps
the
spring
after
he
had
killed
mike
dog
henry
sprang
out
of
the
bushes
one
day
while
mike
was
walking
toward
town
to
go
to
the
library
it
was
late
march
warm
enough
for
bikeriding
but
in
those
days
witcham
road
turned
to
dirt
just
beyond
the
bowers
place
which
meant
that
it
was
a
quagmire
of
mud
no
good
for
bikes
hello
nigger
henry
had
said
emerging
from
the
bushes
grinning
mike
backed
off
eyes
flicking
warily
right
and
left
watching
for
a
chance
to
get
away
he
knew
that
if
he
could
buttonhook
around
henry
he
could
outdistance
him
henry
was
big
and
henry
was
strong
but
henry
was
also
slow
gonna
make
me
a
tarbab
henry
said
advancing
on
the
smaller
boy
you're
not
black
enough
but
i'll
fix
that
mike
cut
his
eyes
to
the
left
and
twitched
his
body
in
that
direction
henry
took
the
bait
and
broke
that
way
too
fast
and
too
far
to
pull
himself
back
reversing
with
a
sweet
and
natural
speed
mike
took
off
to
the
right
gin
high
school
he
would
make
the
varsity
football
team
as
a
tailback
his
sophomore
year
and
was
only
kept
from
breaking
the
school
alltime
scoring
record
by
a
broken
leg
halfway
through
his
senior
season
he
would
have
made
it
easily
past
henry
but
for
the
mud
it
was
greasy
and
mike
slipped
to
his
knees
before
he
could
get
up
henry
was
upon
him
niggerniggernigge
henry
cried
in
a
kind
of
religious
ecstasy
as
he
rolled
mike
over
mud
went
up
the
back
of
mike
shirt
and
down
the
back
of
his
pants
he
could
feel
it
squeezing
into
his
shoes
but
he
did
not
begin
to
cry
until
henry
slathered
mud
across
his
face
plugging
up
both
of
his
nostrils
now
youre
black
henry
had
screamed
gleefully
rubbing
mud
in
mike
hair
now
you're
reeeely
black
he
ripped
up
mike
poplin
jacket
and
the
teeshirt
beneath
and
slammed
a
poultice
of
mud
down
over
the
boy
bellybutton
now
you're
as
black
as
midnight
in
a
mineshaft
henry
screamed
triumphantly
and
slammed
mudplugs
into
both
of
mike
ears
then
he
stood
back
muddy
hands
hooked
into
his
belt
and
yelled
j
killed
your
dog
black
bo
but
mike
did
not
hear
this
because
of
the
mud
in
his
ears
and
his
own
terrified
sobs
henry
kicked
a
final
sticky
clot
of
mud
onto
mike
and
then
turned
and
walked
home
not
looking
back
a
few
moments
later
mike
got
up
and
did
the
same
still
weeping
his
mother
was
of
course
furious
she
wanted
will
hanlon
to
call
chief
borton
and
have
him
out
to
the
bowers
house
before
the
sun
went
down
he
been
after
mikey
before
mike
heard
her
say
he
was
sitting
in
the
bathtub
and
his
parents
were
in
the
kitchen
this
was
his
second
tub
of
water
the
first
had
turned
black
almost
the
moment
he
had
stepped
into
it
and
sat
down
in
her
fury
his
mother
had
lapsed
into
a
thick
texas
patois
mike
could
barely
understand
you
put
the
law
on
him
will
hanlon
both
the
dog
ad
the
pup
you
law
em
hear
me
will
heard
but
did
not
do
as
his
wife
asked
eventually
when
she
cooled
down
by
then
it
was
that
night
and
mike
two
hours
asleep
he
refreshed
her
on
the
facts
of
life
chief
borton
was
not
sheriff
sullivan
if
borton
had
been
sheriff
when
the
incident
of
the
poisoned
chickens
occurred
will
would
never
have
gotten
his
two
hundred
dollars
and
would
have
had
to
be
content
with
that
state
of
affairs
some
men
would
stand
behind
you
and
some
men
wouldn't
borton
was
of
the
latter
type
he
was
in
fact
a
jellyfish
mike
has
had
trouble
with
that
kid
before
yes
he
told
jessica
but
he
hasn't
had
much
because
he
careful
around
henry
bowers
this
will
serve
to
make
him
more
careful
you
mean
you're
just
going
to
let
it
go
bowers
has
told
his
son
stories
about
his
dealings
with
me
i
guess
will
said
and
his
son
hates
the
three
of
us
because
of
them
and
because
his
father
has
also
told
him
that
hating
niggers
is
what
men
are
supposed
to
do
it
all
comes
back
to
that
i
can't
change
the
fact
that
our
son
is
a
negro
any
more
than
i
can
sit
here
and
tell
you
that
henry
bowers
is
going
to
be
the
last
one
to
take
after
him
because
his
skin
brown
he
going
to
have
to
deal
with
it
all
the
rest
of
his
life
as
i
have
dealt
with
it
and
you
have
dealt
with
it
why
right
there
in
that
christian
school
you
were
bound
he
was
going
to
go
to
the
teacher
told
them
blacks
weren't
as
good
as
whites
because
noah
son
ham
looked
at
his
father
while
he
was
drunk
and
naked
and
noah
other
two
boys
cast
their
eyes
aside
that
why
the
sons
of
ham
were
condemned
to
always
be
hewers
of
wood
and
drawers
of
water
she
said
and
mikey
said
she
was
lookin
right
at
him
while
she
told
that
story
to
them
jessica
looked
at
her
husband
mute
and
miserable
two
tears
fell
one
from
each
eye
and
tracked
slowly
down
her
face
isn't
there
ever
any
getting
away
from
it
his
reply
was
kind
but
implacable
it
was
a
tune
when
wives
believed
their
husbands
and
jessica
had
no
reason
to
doubt
her
will
no
there
is
no
getting
away
from
the
word
nigger
not
now
not
in
the
world
we've
been
given
to
live
in
you
and
me
country
niggers
from
maine
are
still
niggers
i
have
thought
times
that
the
reason
i
came
back
to
derry
was
that
there
is
no
better
place
to
remember
that
but
i'll
have
a
talk
with
the
boy
the
next
day
he
called
mike
out
of
the
barn
will
sat
on
the
yoke
of
his
harrow
and
patted
a
place
next
to
him
for
mike
you
want
to
stay
out
of
that
henry
bowers
way
he
said
mike
nodded
his
father
is
crazy
mike
nodded
again
he
had
heard
as
much
around
town
his
few
glimpses
of
mr
bowers
had
reinforced
the
notion
don't
mean
just
a
little
crazy
will
said
lighting
a
homerolled
bugler
cigarette
and
looking
at
his
son
he
about
three
steps
away
from
the
boobyhatch
he
came
back
from
the
war
that
way
i
think
henry
crazy
too
mike
said
his
voice
was
low
but
firm
and
that
strengthened
will
heart
although
he
was
even
after
a
checkered
life
whose
incidents
had
included
almost
being
burned
alive
in
a
juryrigged
speakeasy
called
the
black
spot
unable
to
believe
a
kid
like
henry
could
be
crazy
well
he
listened
to
his
father
too
much
but
that
is
only
natural
will
said
yet
on
this
his
son
was
closer
to
the
truth
henry
bowers
either
because
of
his
constant
association
with
his
father
or
because
of
something
else
some
interior
thing
was
indeed
slowly
but
surely
going
crazy
i
don't
want
you
b
make
a
career
out
of
running
away
his
father
said
but
because
you're
a
negro
you're
apt
to
be
put
upon
a
good
deal
do
you
know
what
i
mean
yes
daddy
mike
said
thinking
of
bob
gautier
at
school
who
had
tried
to
explain
to
mike
that
nigger
could
not
be
a
bad
word
because
his
father
used
it
all
the
time
in
fact
bob
told
mike
earnestly
it
was
a
good
word
when
a
fighter
on
the
friday
night
fights
took
a
bad
beating
and
managed
to
stay
on
his
feet
his
daddy
said
his
head
is
as
hard
as
a
nigger'
and
when
someone
was
really
putting
out
at
his
work
which
for
mr
gautier
was
star
beef
in
town
his
daddy
said
that
man
works
like
a
nigger
and
my
daddy
is
just
as
much
a
christian
as
your
daddy
bob
had
finished
mike
remembered
that
looking
at
bob
gautier
white
earnest
pinched
face
surrounded
by
the
mangy
fur
of
his
handmedown
snowsuit
hood
he
had
felt
not
anger
but
a
terrible
sadness
that
made
him
feel
like
crying
he
had
seen
honesty
and
good
intent
in
bob
face
but
what
he
had
fe/t
was
loneliness
distance
a
great
whistling
emptiness
between
himself
and
the
other
boy
see
that
you
do
know
what
i
mean
will
said
and
ruffled
his
son
hair
and
what
it
all
comes
down
to
is
that
you
have
to
be
careful
where
you
take
your
stand
you
have
to
ask
yourself
if
henry
bowers
is
worth
the
trouble
is
he
n
mike
said
no
i
don't
think
so
it
would
be
yet
awhile
before
he
changed
his
mind
july
rd
in
fact
while
henry
bowers
victor
criss
belch
huggins
peter
gordon
and
a
halfretarded
high
school
boy
named
steve
sadler
known
as
moose
after
the
character
in
the
archie
comics
were
chasing
a
winded
mike
hanlon
through
the
trainyard
and
toward
the
barrens
about
half
a
mile
away
bill
and
the
rest
of
the
loser
club
were
still
sitting
on
the
bank
of
the
kenduskeag
pondering
their
nightmare
problem
tnunknow
w
where
ihihit
is
i
think
bill
said
finally
breaking
the
silence
the
sewers
stan
said
and
they
all
jumped
at
a
sudden
harsh
rattling
noise
eddie
smiled
guiltily
as
he
lowered
his
aspirator
back
into
his
lap
bill
nodded
i
wuhwuhwas
aasking
my
fuh
father
about
the
suhsewers
a
ffew
nuhh+
hights
aaago
all
of
this
area
was
originally
marsh
zack
told
his
ọn
and
the
town
fathers
managed
to
put
what
downtown
these
days
in
the
very
worst
part
of
it
the
section
of
the
canal
that
runs
under
center
and
main
and
comes
out
in
bassey
park
is
really
nothing
but
a
drain
that
happens
to
hold
the
kenduskeag
most
of
the
year
those
drains
are
almost
empty
but
they're
important
when
the
spring
runoff
comes
or
when
there
are
floods
he
paused
here
perhaps
thinking
that
it
had
been
during
the
flood
of
the
previous
autumn
that
he
had
lost
his
younger
son
because
of
the
pumps
he
finished
puhpuhpumps
bill
asked
turning
his
head
a
little
without
even
thinking
about
it
when
he
stuttered
over
the
plosive
sounds
spittle
flew
from
his
lips
the
drainage
pumps
his
father
said
they're
in
the
barrens
concrete
sleeves
that
stick
about
three
feet
out
of
the
ground
buhbuh
ben
hanscom
calls
them
muhmorlock
hhole
bill
said
grinning
zack
grinned
back
but
it
was
a
shadow
of
his
old
grin
they
were
in
zack
workshop
where
he
was
turning
chairdowels
without
much
interest
sumppumps
is
all
they
really
are
kiddo
he
said
they
sit
in
cylinders
about
ten
feet
deep
and
they
pump
the
sewage
and
the
runoff
along
when
the
slope
of
the
land
levels
out
or
angles
up
a
little
it
old
machinery
and
the
city
should
have
some
new
pumps
but
the
council
always
pleads
poverty
when
the
item
comes
up
on
the
agenda
at
budget
meetings
if
i
had
a
quarter
for
every
time
i've
been
down
there
up
to
my
knees
in
crap
rewiring
one
of
those
motors
but
you
don't
want
to
hear
all
this
bill
why
don't
you
go
watch
tv
i
think
sugarfoot
on
tonight
i
dddo
wuhwant
to
hhear
it
bill
said
and
not
only
because
he
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
there
was
something
terrible
under
derry
someplace
why
do
you
want
to
hear
about
a
bunch
of
sewerpump
zack
asked
skuh
skub
hool
ruhrepor
bill
said
wildly
school
out
nnnext
year
well
it
a
pretty
dull
subject
zack
said
teacher'll
probably
give
you
an
f
for
putting
him
to
sleep
look
here
the
kenduskea
he
drew
a
straight
line
in
the
light
fall
of
sawdust
on
the
table
in
which
his
handsaw
was
embedded
and
here
the
barrens
now
because
downtown
lower
than
the
residential
aeas
kansas
street
say
or
the
old
cape
or
west
broadway
most
of
the
downtown
waste
has
to
be
pumped
into
the
river
the
waste
from
the
houses
flows
down
to
the
barrens
pretty
much
on
its
own
you
see
yyye
bill
said
drawing
a
little
closer
to
his
father
to
look
at
the
lines
close
enough
so
that
his
shoulder
was
against
his
father
arm
someday
they'll
put
a
stop
to
pumping
raw
sewage
into
the
river
and
that'll
be
an
end
to
the
whole
business
but
for
now
we've
got
those
pumps
in
he
what
did
your
buddy
call
em
morlock
holes
bill
said
with
not
a
trace
of
a
stutter
neither
he
nor
his
father
noticed
yeah
that
what
the
pumps
in
the
morlock
holes
are
for
anyway
and
they
work
pretty
well
except
when
there
too
much
rain
and
the
streams
overflow
because
although
the
gravity
drains
and
the
sewers
with
the
pumps
were
meant
to
be
separate
systems
they
actually
crisscross
all
over
the
place
see
he
drew
a
series
of
x
radiating
out
from
the
line
which
represented
the
kenduskeag
and
bill
nodded
well
the
only
thing
you
need
to
know
about
water
draining
is
that
it
will
go
wherever
it
can
when
it
gets
high
it
starts
to
fill
up
the
drains
as
well
as
the
sewers
when
the
water
in
the
drains
gets
high
enough
b
reach
those
pumps
it
shorts
them
out
makes
trouble
for
me
because
i
have
to
fix
them
dad
hhow
big
are
the
suhsewers
and
drains
you
mean
what
the
bore
on
them
bill
nodded
the
main
sewers
are
maybe
six
feet
in
diameter
the
secondaries
from
the
residential
areas
are
three
or
four
i
guess
some
of
them
might
be
a
little
bigger
and
believe
me
when
i
tell
you
this
billy
and
you
can
tell
your
friends
you
never
want
to
go
into
one
of
those
pipes
not
in
a
game
not
on
a
dare
not
for
any
reason
why
a
dozen
different
town
governments
have
built
on
them
since
or
so
during
the
depression
the
wpa
put
in
a
whole
secondary
drain
system
and
a
tertiary
sewer
system
there
was
lots
of
money
for
public
works
back
then
but
the
fellow
who
bossed
those
projects
got
killed
in
world
war
ii
and
about
five
years
later
the
water
department
found
out
that
the
system
blueprints
were
mostly
gone
that
about
nine
pounds
of
blues
that
just
disappeared
sometime
between
and
my
point
is
that
nobody
knows
where
all
the
damned
sewers
and
drains
go
or
why
when
they
work
nobody
cares
when
they
don't
there
three
or
four
sad
sacks
from
derry
water
who
have
to
try
and
find
out
which
pump
went
flooey
or
where
the
plugup
is
and
when
they
go
down
there
they
damn
well
pack
a
lunch
it
dark
and
it
smelly
and
there
are
rats
those
are
all
good
reasons
to
stay
out
but
the
best
reason
is
that
you
could
get
lost
it
happened
before
lost
under
derry
lost
in
the
sewers
lost
in
the
dark
there
was
something
so
dismal
and
chilling
about
the
idea
that
bill
was
momentarily
silenced
then
he
said
but
haven't
they
ever
suhsuhhent
people
down
to
map
i
ought
to
finish
these
dowels
zack
said
abruptly
turning
his
back
and
pulling
away
go
on
in
and
see
what
on
bbbut
dah
dah
dad
go
on
bill
zack
said
and
bill
could
feel
the
coldness
again
that
coldness
made
suppers
a
kind
of
torture
as
his
father
leafed
through
electrical
journals
he
hoped
for
a
promotion
the
following
year
as
his
mother
read
one
of
her
endless
british
mysteries
marsh
sayers
innes
allingham
eating
in
that
coldness
robbed
food
of
its
taste
it
was
like
eating
frozen
dinners
that
had
never
seen
the
inside
of
an
oven
sometimes
after
he
would
go
up
to
his
room
and
lie
on
his
bed
holding
his
griping
stomach
and
think
he
thrusts
his
fists
against
the
posts
and
still
insists
he
sees
the
ghosts
he
thought
of
that
more
and
more
since
georgie
had
died
although
his
mother
had
taught
him
the
phrase
two
years
before
it
had
taken
on
a
talismanic
cast
in
his
mind
the
day
he
could
walk
up
to
his
mother
and
simply
speak
that
phrase
without
tripping
or
stuttering
looking
her
right
in
the
eye
as
he
spoke
it
the
coldness
would
break
apart
her
eyes
would
light
up
and
she
would
hug
him
and
say
wonderful
billy
what
a
good
boy
what
a
good
boy
he
had
of
course
told
this
to
no
one
wild
horses
would
not
have
dragged
it
from
him
neither
the
rack
nor
the
boot
would
have
induced
him
to
give
up
this
secret
fantasy
which
lay
at
the
very
center
of
his
heart
if
he
could
say
this
phrase
which
she
had
taught
him
casually
one
saturday
morning
as
he
and
georgie
sat
watching
guy
madison
and
andy
devine
in
the
adventures
of
wild
bill
hickok
it
would
be
like
the
kiss
that
awakened
sleeping
beauty
from
her
cold
dreams
to
the
warmer
world
of
the
fairytale
prince
love
he
thrusts
his
fists
against
the
posts
and
still
insists
he
sees
the
ghosts
nor
did
he
tell
it
to
his
friends
on
that
july
rd
but
he
told
them
what
his
father
had
told
him
about
the
derry
sewer
and
drain
systems
he
was
a
boy
to
whom
invention
came
easily
and
naturally
sometimes
more
easily
than
telling
the
truth
and
the
scene
he
painted
was
quite
different
from
the
scene
in
which
the
conversation
had
actually
taken
place
he
and
his
old
man
had
been
watching
the
tube
together
he
said
having
cups
of
coffee
your
dad
lets
you
have
coffee
eddie
asked
shshsure
bill
said
wow
eddie
said
my
mother
would
never
let
me
have
a
coffee
she
says
the
caffeine
in
it
is
dangerous
he
paused
she
drinks
quite
a
bit
of
it
herself
though
my
dad
lets
me
have
coffee
if
i
want
it
beverly
said
but
he'd
kill
me
if
he
knew
i
smoked
what
makes
you
so
sure
it
in
the
sewers
richie
asked
looking
from
bill
to
stan
uris
and
then
back
to
bill
again
eeeverything
ggoes
back
tto
thththa
bill
said
the
vvoices
behheheverly
heard
ccame
from
the
dddrain
and
the
bluhblood
when
the
ecclown
chchased
us
those

big
bill
richie
said
i
told
you
that
i
know
it
crazy
but
it
was
a
werewolf
he
looked
at
the
others
defensively
honest
to
god
i
saw
it
bill
said
tt
was
a
werewolf
for
yyyou
huh
bill
said
ddon't
you
sssee
it
was
a
wuhwuhwere
wolf
for
yyou
because
yyou
saw
that
duhhumb
movie
at

a

i
don't

i

ben
said
quietly
went
to
the
hlibrary
and
hooked
it
uhuhup
bill
said
i
think
it
a
gluhgluh
he
paused
throat
straining
and
spat
it
out
a
glamour
glamme
eddie
asked
doubtfully
ggglamour
bill
said
and
spelled
it
he
told
them
about
an
encyclopedia
entry
on
the
subject
and
a
chapter
he
had
read
in
a
book
called
night
truth
glamour
he
said
was
the
gaelic
name
for
the
creature
which
was
haunting
derry
other
races
and
other
cultures
at
other
times
had
different
words
for
it
but
they
all
meant
the
same
thing
the
plains
indians
called
it
a
manitou
which
sometimes
took
the
shape
of
a
mountainlion
or
an
elk
or
an
eagle
these
same
indians
believed
that
the
spirit
of
a
manitou
could
sometimes
enter
them
and
at
these
times
it
was
possible
for
them
to
shape
the
clouds
themselves
into
representations
of
those
animals
for
which
their
houses
had
been
named
the
himalayans
called
it
a
tallus
or
taelus
which
meant
an
evil
magic
being
that
could
read
your
mind
and
then
assume
the
shape
of
the
thing
you
were
most
afraid
of
in
central
europe
it
had
been
called
eylak
brother
of
the
vurderlak
or
vampire
in
france
it
was
le
loupgarou
or
skinchanger
a
concept
that
had
been
crudely
translated
as
the
werewolf
but
bill
told
them
le
loupgarou
which
he
pronounced
le
loopgaroo'
could
be
anything
anything
at
all
a
wolf
a
hawk
a
sheep
even
a
bug
did
any
of
those
articles
tell
you
how
to
beat
a
glamour
beverly
asked
bill
nodded
but
he
didn't
look
hopeful
the
hhhimalayans
had
a
rihhihitual
to
gget
rihrid
of
++
it
but
ihit
pretty
gruh
grub
gruesome
they
looked
at
him
not
wanting
to
hear
but
needing
to
eit
was
cuhcalled
the
rrritual
of
chiihchii
bill
said
and
went
on
to
explain
what
that
was
if
you
were
a
himalayan
holyman
you
tracked
the
taelus
the
taelus
stuck
its
tongue
out
you
stuck
yours
out
you
and
it
overlapped
tongues
and
then
you
both
bit
in
all
the
way
so
you
were
sort
of
stapled
together
eye
to
eye
oh
i
think
i'm
gonna
puke
beverly
said
rolling
over
on
the
dirt
ben
patted
her
back
tentatively
then
looked
around
to
see
if
he
had
been
observed
he
hadn't
been
the
others
were
looking
at
bill
mesmerized
what
then
eddie
asked
wwwell
bill
said
this
sounds
cuhcuhcrazy
bbut
the
book
ssaid
that
ththen
yyou
started
telling
juh
jokes
and
rih
riddles
what
stan
asked
bill
nodded
his
face
that
of
a
correspondent
who
wants
you
to
know
without
coining
right
out
and
saying
it
that
he
doesn't
make
the
news
but
only
reports
it
rright
f
first
the
¢taelus
monster
would
tell
ooone
then
yyyou
got
to
tttell

and
yyou
ww
went

up

against

linked
around

shins
i
don't
see
how
people
could
talk
with
their
tongues
you
know
nailed
together
richie
immediately
ran
out
his
tongue
gripped
it
with
his
fingers
and
intoned
my
father
works
in
a
shit
yard
that
broke
them
all
up
for
awhile
even
though
it
was
a
baby
joke
m
maybe
it
was
suhsuhsuhpposed
to
be

bill
said
a

bill
nodded
then
the

ggot

and
eeeeat
him
his

i

bbut
if

fffirst
it
had
to
go

asked
bill
shook
his
head
do
you
believe
any
of
it
stan
asked
sounding
as
if
he
wanted
to
scoff
but
could
not
quite
find
the
moral
or
mental
force
to
do
so
bill
shrugged
and
said
i
aaalmost
ddo
he
seemed
about
to
say
more
then
shook
his
head
and
remained
silent
tt
explains
a
lot
eddie
said
slowly
the
clown
the
leper
the
werewolf
he
looked.over
at
stan
the
dead
boys
too
i
guess
this
sounds
like
a
job
for
richard
tozie
richie
said
in
the
movietone
newsreel
announcer
voice
man
of
a
thousand
jokes
and
six
thousand
riddles

it
we'd
all
get
killed
ben
said
slowly
in
great
pain
at
this
they
all
laughed
again
so
what
do
we
do
about
it
stan
demanded
and
once
again
bill
could
only
shake
his
head
and
feel
he
almost
knew
stan
stood
up
let
go
somewhere
else
he
said
t'm

fanny
fatigue

beverly
said
it
shady
and
nice
she
glanced
at
stan
i

richie
said
standing
up
beside
stan
it
the
j.d
in
me
baby
he
flipped
up
his
collar
and
began
to
stalk
around
like
james
dean
in
rebel
without
a
cause
they
hurt
me
he
said
looking
moody
and
scratching
his
chest

like

beverly
said
and
sighed
tve
got
some
firecrackers
stan
said
and
they
forgot
all
about
glamours
manitous
and
richie
bad
james
dean
imitation
as
stan
produced
a
package
of
black
cats
from
his
hip
pocket
even
bill
was
impressed

beverly
began
to
shriek
with
laughter
and
actually
appeared
to
be
approaching
apoplexy
before
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
bill
began
to
laugh
eddie
began
to
laugh
and
after
a
moment
even
stan
joined
in
the
sound
of
it
drifted
across
the
broad
shallow
expanse
of
the
kenduskeag
on
that
day
before
july
th
a
summersound
as
bright
as
the
sunrays
darting
off
the
water
and
none
of
them
saw
the
orange
eyes
staring
at
them
from
a
tangle
of
brambles
and
sterile
blackberry
bushes
to
their
left
this
brambly
patch
scrubbed
the
entire
bank
for
thirty
feet
and
in
the
center
of
it
was
one
of
ben
morlock
holes
it
was
from
this
raised
concrete
pipe
that
the
eyes
each
more
than
two
feet
across
stared
the
reason
mike
ran
afoul
of
henry
bowers
and
his
notsomerry
band
on
that
same
day
was
because
the
next
day
was
the
glorious
fourth
the
church
school
had
a
band
in
which
mike
played
the
trombone
on
the
fourth
the
band
would
march
in
the
annual
holiday
parade
playing
the
battle
hymn
of
the
republic
onward
christian
soldiers
and
america
the
beautiful
this
was
an
occasion
that
mike
had
been
looking
forward
to
for
over
a
month
he
walked
to
the
final
rehearsal
because
his
bike
had
a
busted
chain
the
rehearsal
was
not
scheduled
until
twothirty
but
he
left
at
one
because
he
wanted
to
polish
his
trombone
which
was
stored
in
the
school
music
room
until
it
glowed
although
his
tromboneplaying
was
really
not
much
better
than
richie
voices
he
was
fond
of
the
instrument
and
whenever
he
felt
blue
a
half
an
hour
of
foghorning
sousa
marches
hymns
or
patriotic
airs
cheered
hun
right
up
again
there
was
a
can
of
saddler
brass
polish
in
one
of
the
flap
pockets
of
his
khaki
shirt
and
two
or
three
clean
rags
were
dangling
from
the
hip
pocket
of
his
jeans
the
thought
of
henry
bowers
was
the
furthest
thing
from
his
mind
a
glance
behind
as
he
approached
neibolt
street
and
the
church
school
would
have
changed
his
mind
in
a
hurry
because
henry
victor
belch
peter
gordon
and
moose
sadler
were
spread
across
the
road
behind
him
if
they
had
left
the
bowers
house
five
minutes
later
mike
would
have
been
out
of
sight
over
the
crest
of
the
next
hill
the
apocalyptic
rockfight
and
everything
that
followed
it
might
have
happened
differently
or
not
at
all
but
it
was
mike
himself
years
later
who
advanced
the
idea
that
perhaps
none
of
them
were
entirely
their
own
masters
in
the
events
of
that
summer
that
if
luck
and
free
will
had
played
parts
then
their
roles
had
been
narrow
ones
he
would
point
out
a
number
of
these
suspicious
coincidences
to
the
others
at
their
reunion
lunch
but
there
was
at
least
one
of
which
he
was
unaware
the
meeting
in
the
barrens
that
day
broke
up
when
stan
uris
produced
the
black
cats
and
the
losers
club
headed
toward
the
dump
to
shoot
them
off
and
victor
belch
and
the
others
had
come
out
to
the
bowers
farm
because
henry
had
firecrackers
cherry
bombs
and
ms
the
possession
of
these
last
would
a
few
years
hence
become
a
felony
the
big
boys
were
planning
to
go
down
beyond
the
trainyard
coalpit
and
explode
henry
treasures
none
of
them
not
even
belch
went
out
to
the
bowers
farm
under
ordinary
circumstances
primarily
because
of
henry
crazy
father
but
also
because
they
always
ended
up
helping
henry
do
his
chores
the
weeding
the
endless
rockpicking
the
lugging
of
wood
the
toting
of
water
the
pitching
of
hay
the
picking
of
whatever
happened
to
be
ripe
at
the
time
of
the
season
peas
cukes
tomatoes
potatoes
these
boys
were
not
exactly
allergic
to
work
but
they
had
plenty
to
do
at
their
own
places
without
sweating
for
henry
kooky
father
who
didn't
much
care
who
he
hit
he
had
once
taken
a
length
of
stovewood
to
victor
criss
when
the
boy
dropped
a
basket
of
tomatoes
he
was
lugging
out
to
the
roadside
stand
getting
whopped
with
a
chunk
of
birch
was
bad
enough
what
made
it
worse
was
that
butch
bowers
had
chanted
tm
gonna
kill
all
the
nips
i'm
gonna
kill
all
the
fuckin
nips
when
he
did
it
dumb
as
he
was
belch
huggins
had
expressed
it
best
i
don't
fuck
with
crazy
people
he
told
victor
one
day
two
years
before
victor
had
laughed
and
agreed
but
the
sirensong
of
all
those
firecrackers
had
been
too
great
to
be
withstood
tell
you
what
henry
victor
said
when
henry
called
him
up
that
morning
at
nine
and
invited
him
out
ti
meet
youat
the
coalpit
around
one
o'clock
what
do
you
say
you
show
up
at
the
coalpit
around
one
and
i'm
not
gonna
be
there
henry
replied
i
got
too
many
chores
if
you
show
up
at
the
coalpit
around
three
i
will
be
there
and
the
first
m
is
going
to
go
right
up
your
old
tan
track
vie
vie
hesitated
then
agreed
to
come
over
and
help
with
the
chores
the
others
came
as
well
and
with
the
five
of
them
all
big
boys
working
like
fiends
around
the
bowers
place
they
got
all
the
chores
finished
by
early
afternoon
when
henry
asked
his
father
if
he
could
go
bowers
the
elder
simply
waved
a
languid
hand
at
his
son
butch
was
settled
in
for
the
afternoon
on
the
back
porch
a
quart
milkbottle
filled
with
exquisitely
hard
cider
by
his
rocker
his
philco
portable
radio
on
the
porch
rail
later
that
afternoon
the
red
sox
would
be
playing
the
washington
senators
a
prospect
that
would
have
given
a
man
who
was
not
crazy
a
bad
case
of
cold
chills
an
unsheathed
japanese
sword
lay
across
butch
lap
a
war
souvenir
which
butch
said
he
had
taken
off
the
body
of
a
dying
nip
on
the
island
of
tarawa
he
had
actually
traded
six
bottles
of
budweiser
and
three
joysticks
for
the
sword
in
honolulu
lately
butch
almost
always
got
out
his
sword
when
he
drank
and
since
all
of
the
boys
including
henry
himself
were
secretly
convinced
that
sooner
or
later
he
would
use
it
on
someone
it
was
best
to
be
far
away
when
it
made
its
appearance
on
butch
lap
the
boys
had
no
more
than
stepped
out
into
the
road
when
henry
spied
mike
hanlon
up
ahead
it
the
nigger
he
said
his
eyes
lighting
up
like
the
eyes
of
a
small
child
contemplating
santa
claus
imminent
arrival
on
christmas
eve
the
nigger
belch
huggins
looked
puzzled
he
had
seen
the
hanlons
only
rarely
and
then
his
dim
eyes
lit
up
oh
yeah
the
nigger
let
get
him
henry
belch
broke
into
a
thunderous
trot
the
others
were
following
suit
when
henry
grabbed
belch
and
hauled
him
back
henry
had
more
experience
than
the
others
chasing
mike
hanlon
and
he
knew
that
catching
him
was
easier
said
than
done
that
black
boy
could
move
he
don't
see
us
let
just
walk
fast
till
he
does
cut
the
distance
they
did
so
an
observer
might
have
been
amused
the
five
of
them
looked
as
if
they
were
trying
out
for
that
peculiar
olympic
walking
competition
moose
sadler
considerable
belly
joggled
up
and
down
inside
his
derry
high
school
teeshirt
sweat
rolled
down
belch
face
which
soon
grew
red
but
the
distance
between
them
and
mike
closed
two
hundred
yards
a
hundred
and
fifty
yards
a
hundred
and
so
far
little
black
sambo
hadn't
looked
back
they
could
hear
him
whistling
what
you
gonna
do
to
him
henry
victor
criss
asked
in
a
low
voice
he
sounded
merely
interested
but
in
truth
he
was
worried
just
lately
henry
had
begun
to
worry
him
more
and
more
he
wouldn't
care
if
henry
wanted
them
to
beat
the
hanlon
kid
up
maybe
even
rip
his
shut
off
or
throw
his
pants
and
underwear
up
in
a
tree
but
he
was
not
sure
that
was
all
henry
had
in
mind
this
year
there
had
been
several
unpleasant
encounters
with
the
children
from
derry
elementary
henry
referred
to
as
the
little
shits
henry
was
used
to
dominating
and
terrorizing
the
little
shits
but
since
march
he
had
been
balked
by
them
time
and
time
again
henry
and
his
friends
had
chased
one
of
them
the
foureyes
tozier
kid
into
freese
and
had
lost
him
somehow
just
when
it
seemed
his
ass
was
surely
theirs
then
on
the
last
day
of
school
the
hanscom
kid
but
victor
didn't
like
to
think
of
that
what
worried
him
simply
was
this
henry
might
go
too
far
just
what
too
far
might
be
was
something
victor
didn't
like
to
think
of
but
his
uneasy
heart
had
prompted
the
question
just
the
same
we're
gonna
catch
him
and
take
him
down
to
that
coalpi
henry
said
i
thought
we'd
put
a
couple
of
firecrackers
in
his
shoes
and
see
if
he
dances
but
not
the
ms
henry
right
if
henry
intended
something
like
that
victor
was
going
to
take
a
powder
an
m
in
each
shoe
would
blow
that
nigger
feet
off
and
that
was
much
too
far
tve
got
only
four
of
those
henry
said
not
taking
his
eyes
off
mike
hanlon
back
they
had
closed
the
distance
to
seventyfive
yards
now
and
he
also
spoke
in
a
low
voice
you
think
i'd
waste
two
of
em
on
a
fuckin
nightfighte
no
henry
course
not
we'll
just
put
a
couple
of
black
cats
in
his
loafers
henry
said
then
strip
him
bareass
and
throw
his
clothes
down
into
the
barrens
maybe
he'll
catch
poison
ivy
going
after
them
we
gotta
roll
im
in
the
coal
too
belch
said
his
formerly
dim
eyes
now
glowing
brightly
okay
henry
is
that
cool
cool
as
a
moose
henry
said
in
a
casual
way
victor
didn't
quite
like
we'll
roll
im
in
the
coal
just
like
i
rolled
im
in
the
mud
that
other
time
and
henry
grinned
showing
teeth
that
were
already
beginning
to
rot
at
the
age
of
twelve
and
i
got
something
to
tell
him
i
don't
think
he
heard
when
i
told
im
before
what
that
henry
peter
asked
peter
gordon
was
merely
interested
and
excited
he
came
from
one
of
berry
good
families
he
lived
on
west
broadway
and
in
two
years
he
would
be
sent
to
prep
school
in
groton
or
so
he
believed
on
that
july
rd
he
was
brighter
than
vie
criss
but
had
not
hung
around
long
enough
to
understand
how
henry
was
eroding
you'll
find
out
henry
said
now
shut
up
we're
gettin
close
they
were
twentyfive
yards
behind
mike
and
henry
was
just
opening
his
mouth
to
give
the
order
to
charge
when
moose
sadler
set
off
the
first
firecracker
of
the
day
moose
had
eaten
three
plates
of
baked
beans
the
night
before
and
the
fart
was
almost
as
loud
as
a
shotgun
blast
mike
looked
around
henry
saw
his
eyes
widen
get
him
henry
howled
mike
froze
for
a
moment
then
he
took
off
running
for
his
life
the
losers
wound
their
way
through
the
bamboo
in
the
barrens
in
this
order
bill
richie
beverly
behind
richie
walking
slim
and
pretty
in
bluejeans
and
a
white
sleeveless
blouse
zoris
on
her
feet
then
ben
trying
not
to
puff
too
loudly
although
it
was
eightyone
that
day
he
was
wearing
one
of
his
baggy
sweatshirts
stan
eddie
bringing
up
the
rear
the
snout
of
his
aspirator
poking
out
of
his
right
front
pants
pocket
bill
had
fallen
into
a
junglesafa
fantasy
as
he
often
did
when
walking
through
this
part
of
the
barrens
the
bamboo
was
high
and
white
limiting
visibility
to
the
path
they
had
made
through
here
the
earth
was
black
and
squelchy
with
sodden
patches
that
had
to
be
avoided
or
jumped
over
if
you
didn't
want
to
get
mud
in
your
shoes
the
puddles
of
standing
water
had
oddly
flat
rainbow
colors
the
air
had
areeky
smell
that
was
half
the
dump
and
half
rotting
vegetation
bill
halted
one
turn
away
from
the
kenduskeag
and
turned
back
to
richie
tttiger
up
ahead
tttozier
richie
nodded
and
turned
back
to
beverly
tige
he
breathed
tiger
she
told
ben
marreater
ben
asked
holding
his
breath
to
keep
from
panting
there
blood
all
over
hi
beverly
said
mareating
tiger
ben
muttered
to
stan
and
he
passed
the
news
back
to
eddie
whose
thin
face
was
hectic
with
excitement
they
faded
into
the
bamboo
leaving
the
path
of
black
earth
that
looped
through
it
magically
bare
the
tiger
passed
in
front
of
them
and
all
of
them
nearly
saw
it
heavy
perhaps
four
hundred
pounds
its
muscles
moving
with
grace
and
power
beneath
the
silk
of
its
striped
pelt
they
nearly
saw
its
green
eyes
and
the
flecks
of
blood
around
its
snout
from
the
last
batch
of
pygmy
warriors
it
had
eaten
alive
the
bamboo
rattled
faintly
a
noise
both
musical
and
eerie
and
then
was
still
again
it
might
have
been
a
breath
of
summer
breeze
or
it
might
have
been
the
passage
of
an
african
tiger
on
its
way
toward
the
old
cape
side
of
the
barrens
gone
bill
said
he
let
out
a
pentup
breath
and
stepped
out
onto
the
path
again
the
others
followed
suit
richie
was
the
only
one
who
had
come
armed
he
produced
a
cappistol
with
a
friction
taped
handgrip
i
could
have
had
aclear
shot
at
him
if
you'd
moved
big
bill
he
said
grimly
he
pushed
the
bridge
of
his
old
glasses
up
on
his
nose
with
the
muzzle
of
the
gun
there
wuhwuhwatusis
around
khher
bill
said
cccan't
rihrisk
a
shot
y
you
wwant
them
down
on
tttop
of
us
oh
richie
said
convinced
bill
made
a
comeon
gesture
with
his
arm
and
they
were
back
on
the
path
again
which
narrowed
into
a
neck
at
the
end
of
the
bamboo
patch
they
stepped
out
onto
the
bank
of
the
kenduskeag
where
a
series
of
steppingstones
led
across
the
river
ben
had
shown
them
how
to
place
them
you
got
a
big
rock
and
plopped
it
in
the
water
then
you
got
a
second
and
plopped
it
in
the
water
while
you
were
stepping
on
the
first
then
you
got
a
third
and
plopped
it
in
the
water
while
you
were
stepping
on
the
second
and
so
on
until
you
were
all
the
way
across
the
river
which
here
and
at
this
time
of
year
was
less
than
a
foot
deep
and
shaled
with
tawny
sandbars
with
your
feet
still
dry
the
trick
was
so
simple
it
was
damn
near
babyish
but
none
of
them
had
seen
it
until
ben
pointed
it
out
he
was
good
at
stuff
like
that
but
when
he
showed
you
he
never
made
you
feel
like
a
dummy
they
went
down
the
bank
in
single
file
and
started
across
the
dry
backs
of
the
rocks
they
had
planted
bill
beverly
called
urgently
he
froze
at
once
not
looking
back
arms
held
out
the
water
chuckled
and
rilled
around
him
wha
there
piranha
fish
in
here
i
saw
them
eat
a
whole
cow
two
days
ago
a
minute
after
it
fell
in
there
was
nothing
but
bones
don't
fall
off
right
bill
said
be
careful
men
they
teetered
their
way
across
the
rocks
a
freighttrain
charged
by
on
the
railway
embankment
as
eddie
kaspbrak
neared
the
halfway
point
and
the
sudden
bhst
of
its
airhorn
caused
him
to
jiggle
on
the
edge
of
balance
he
looked
into
the
bright
water
and
for
one
moment
between
the
sunnxx
ashes
that
darted
arrows
of
light
into
his
eyes
he
actually
saw
the
cruising
piranhas
they
were
not
part
of
the
makebelieve
that
went
with
bill
jungle
safari
fantasy
he
was
quite
sure
of
that
the
fish
he
saw
looked
like
oversized
goldfish
with
the
great
ugly
jaws
of
catfish
or
groupers
sawteeth
protruded
between
their
thick
lips
and
like
goldfish
they
were
orange
as
orange
as
the
fluffy
pompoms
you
sometimes
saw
on
the
suits
the
clowns
wore
at
the
circus
they
circled
in
the
shallow
water
gnashing
eddie
pin
wheeled
his
arms
i'm
going
in
he
thought
i'm
going
in
and
they'll
eat
me
alive
then
stanley
uris
gripped
his
wrist
firmly
and
brought
him
back
to
dead
center
close
call
stan
said
if
you
fell
in
your
mother'd
give
you
heck
thoughts
of
his
mother
were
for
once
the
furthest
things
from
eddie
mind
the
others
had
gained
the
far
bank
now
and
were
counting
cars
on
the
freight
eddie
stared
wildly
into
stan
eyes
then
looked
into
the
water
again
he
saw
a
potatochip
bag
go
dancing
by
but
that
was
all
he
looked
up
at
stan
again
stan
i
saw
what
eddie
shook
his
head
nothing
i
guess
he
said
t'm
just
a
little
but
they
were
there
yes
they
were
and
they
would
have
eaten
me
alive
jumpy
the
tiger
i
guess
keep
going
this
western
bank
of
the
kenduskeag
the
old
cape
bank
was
a
quagmire
of
mud
during
rainy
weather
and
the
spring
runoff
but
there
had
been
no
heavy
rain
in
derry
for
two
weeks
or
more
and
the
bank
had
dried
to
an
alien
crackglaze
from
which
several
of
those
cement
cylinders
poked
casting
grim
little
shadows
about
twenty
yards
farther
down
a
cement
pipe
jutted
out
over
the
kenduskeag
and
spilled
a
steady
thin
stream
of
foul
looking
brown
water
into
the
river
ben
said
quietly
it
creepy
here
and
the
others
nodded
bill
led
them
up
the
dry
bank
and
back
into
the
heavy
shrubbery
where
bugs
whirred
and
chiggers
chigged
every
now
and
then
there
would
be
a
heavy
ruffle
of
wings
as
a
bird
took
off
once
a
squirrel
ran
across
their
path
and
about
five
minutes
later
as
they
approached
the
low
wrinkle
of
ridge
that
guarded
the
town
dump
blind
side
a
large
rat
with
a
bit
of
cellophane
caught
in
its
whiskers
trundled
in
front
of
bill
passing
along
its
own
secret
run
through
its
own
microcosmic
wilderness
the
smell
of
the
dump
was
now
clear
and
pungent
a
black
column
of
smoke
rose
in
the
sky
the
ground
while
still
heavily
overgrown
except
for
their
own
narrow
path
began
to
be
strewn
with
litter
bill
had
dubbed
this
dumpdandruff
and
richie
had
been
delighted
he
had
laughed
almost
until
he
cried
you
ought
to
write
that
down
big
bill
he
said
that
really
good
papers
caught
on
branches
wavered
and
flapped
like
cutrate
pennants
here
was
a
silver
gleam
of
summer
sun
reflected
from
a
clutch
of
tin
cans
lying
at
the
bottom
of
a
green
and
tangled
hollow
there
the
hotter
reflection
of
sunrays
bouncing
off
a
broken
beer
bottle
beverly
spied
a
babydoll
its
plastic
skin
so
brightly
pink
it
looked
almost
boiled
she
picked
it
up
then
dropped
it
with
a
little
cry
as
she
saw
the
whitish
gray
beetles
squirming
from
beneath
its
moldy
skirt
and
down
its
rotting
legs
she
rubbed
her
fingers
on
her
jeans
they
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
ridge
and
looked
down
into
the
dump
oh
shit
bill
said
and
jammed
his
hands
into
his
pockets
as
he
others
gathered
around
him
they
were
burning
the
northern
end
today
but
here
at
their
end
the
dumpkeeper
he
was
in
fact
armando
fazio
mandy
to
his
friends
and
the
bachelor
brother
of
the
derry
elementary
school
janitor
was
tinkering
on
the
world
war
ii
d
dozer
he
used
to
push
the
crap
into
piles
for
burning
his
shirt
was
off
and
the
big
portable
radio
sitting
under
the
canvas
parasol
on
the
dozer
seat
was
putting
out
the
red
sox
senators
pregame
festivities
can't
go
down
there
ben
agreed
mandy
fazio
was
not
a
bad
guy
but
when
he
saw
kids
in
the
dump
he
ran
them
off
at
once
because
of
the
rats
because
of
the
poison
he
regularly
sowed
to
keep
the
rat
population
down
because
of
the
potential
for
cuts
falls
and
burns
but
mostly
because
he
believed
a
dump
was
no
place
for
children
to
be
ain't
you
nice
he
would
yell
at
the
kids
he
spied
who
had
been
drawn
to
the
dump
with
their
.s
to
plink
away
at
bottles
or
rats
or
seagulls
or
by
the
exotic
fascination
of
dumppickin
you
might
find
a
toy
that
still
worked
a
chair
that
could
be
mended
for
a
clubhouse
or
a
junked
tv
with
the
picturetube
still
intact
if
you
threw
a
rock
through
one
of
these
there
was
a
very
satisfying
explosion
ain't
you
kids
nice
mandy
would
bellow
he
bellowed
not
because
he
was
angry
but
because
he
was
deaf
and
wore
no
hearingaid
dintchore
folks
teach
you
to
be
nice
nice
boys
and
girls
don't
play
in
the
dump
go
to
the
park
go
to
the
liberry
go
down
to
community
house
and
play
box
hockey
be
nice
nop
richie
said
guess
the
dump
out
they
all
sat
down
for
a
few
moments
to
watch
mandy
work
on
his
dozer
hoping
he
would
give
up
and
go
away
but
not
really
believing
he
would
the
presence
of
the
radio
suggested
mandy
intended
to
stay
all
afternoon
it
was
enough
to
piss
off
the
pope
bill
thought
there
was
really
no
better
place
to
come
with
firecrackers
than
the
dump
you
could
put
them
under
tin
cans
and
then
watch
the
cans
fly
into
the
air
when
the
firecrackers
went
off
or
you
could
light
the
fuses
and
drop
them
into
bottles
and
then
run
like
hell
the
bottles
didn't
always
break
but
usually
they
did
wish
we
had
some
m
richie
sighed
unaware
of
how
soon
one
would
be
chucked
at
his
head
my
mother
says
people
ought
to
be
happy
with
what
they
hav
eddie
said
so
solemnly
that
they
all
laughed
when
the
laughter
died
away
they
all
looked
toward
bill
again
bill
thought
about
it
and
then
said
i
nuh
know
a
pplace
there
an
old
gruh
grub
gravel
pit
at
the
end
of
the
bunbarrens
by
the
tttrainyards
yea
stan
said
getting
to
his
feet
i
know
that
place
you're
a
genius
bill
they'll
really
echo
there
beverly
agreed
well
let
go
richie
said
the
six
of
them
one
shy
of
the
magic
number
walked
along
the
brow
of
the
hill
which
circled
the
dump
mandy
fazio
glanced
up
once
and
saw
them
silhouetted
against
the
blue
sky
like
indians
out
on
a
raiding
party
he
thought
about
hollering
at
them
the
barrens
was
no
place
for
kids
and
then
he
turned
back
to
his
work
instead
at
least
they
weren't
in
his
dump
mike
hanlon
ran
past
the
church
school
without
pausing
and
pelted
straight
up
neibolt
street
toward
the
derry
trainyards
there
was
a
janitor
at
ncs
but
mr
gendron
was
very
old
and
even
deafer
than
mandy
fazio
also
he
liked
to
spend
most
of
his
summer
days
asleep
in
the
basement
by
the
summersilent
boiler
stretched
out
in
a
battered
old
reclining
chair
with
the
derry
news
in
his
lap
mike
woul
still
be
pounding
on
the
door
and
shouting
for
the
old
man
to
let
him
in
when
henry
bowers
came
up
behind
him
and
tore
his
freaking
head
off
so
mike
just
ran
but
not
blindly
he
was
trying
to
pace
himself
trying
to
control
his
breathing
not
yet
going
all
out
henry
belch
and
moose
sadler
presented
no
problems
even
relatively
fresh
they
ran
like
wounded
buffalo
victor
criss
and
peter
gordon
however
were
much
faster
as
mike
passed
the
house
where
bill
and
richie
had
seen
the
clown
or
the
werewolf
he
snapped
a
glance
back
and
was
alarmed
to
see
that
peter
gordon
had
almost
closed
the
distance
peter
was
grinning
cheerfully
a
steeplechase
grin
a
fullout
polo
grin
a
pippipjollygood
show
grin
and
mike
thought
j
wonder
if
he'd
grin
that
way
if
he
knew
what
going
to
happen
if
they
catch
me
does
he
think
they're
just
going
to
say
tag
you're
it
and
run
away
as
the
trainyard
gate
with
its
sign
private
property
keep
out
violators
will
be
prosecuted
loomed
up
mike
vas
forced
to
let
himself
out
to
the
limit
there
was
no
pain
his
breathing
was
rapid
yet
still
controlled
but
he
knew
everything
was
going
to
start
hurting
if
he
had
to
keep
this
pace
up
for
long
the
gate
was
standing
halfway
open
he
snapped
a
second
look
back
and
saw
that
he'd
pulled
away
from
peter
again
victor
was
perhaps
ten
paces
behind
peter
the
others
now
forty
or
fifty
yards
back
even
in
that
quick
glance
mike
could
see
the
black
anger
on
henry
face
he
skittered
through
the
opening
whirled
and
slammed
the
gate
closed
he
heard
the
click
as
it
latched
a
moment
later
peter
gordon
slammed
into
the
chainlink
and
a
moment
after
that
victor
criss
ran
up
beside
him
peter
smile
was
gone
a
sulky
balked
look
had
replaced
it
he
grabbed
for
the
latch
but
of
course
there
was
none
the
latch
was
on
the
inside
incredibly
he
said
come
on
kid
open
the
gate
that
not
fair
what
your
idea
of
fair
mike
asked
panting
five
against
one
fairu
peter
repeated
as
if
he
had
not
heard
mike
at
all
mike
looked
at
victor
saw
the
troubled
look
in
victor
eyes
he
started
to
speak
but
that
was
when
the
others
pulled
up
to
the
gate
open
up
nigger
henry
bawled
he
began
to
shake
the
chainlink
with
such
ferocity
that
peter
looked
at
him
startled
open
up
open
up
right
no
won't
mike
said
quietly
open
u
belch
shouted
open
up
ya
fuckin
jigabo
mike
backed
away
from
the
gate
his
heart
beating
heavily
in
his
chest
he
couldn't
remember
ever
being
quite
this
scared
quite
this
upset
they
lined
their
side
of
the
gate
shouting
at
him
calling
him
names
for
nigger
he
had
never
dreamed
existed
nightfighter
ubangi
spade
blackberry
junglebunny
others
he
was
barely
aware
that
henry
was
taking
something
from
his
pocket
that
he
had
popped
a
wooden
match
alight
with
his
thumbnail
and
then
a
round
red
something
came
over
the
fence
and
he
flinched
instinctively
away
as
the
cherrybomb
exploded
to
his
left
kicking
up
dust
the
tang
silenced
them
all
for
a
moment
mike
stared
unbelievingly
at
them
through
the
fence
and
they
stared
back
peter
gordon
looked
utterly
shocked
and
even
belch
looked
stunned
they're
ascared
of
him
now
mike
thought
suddenly
and
a
new
voice
spoke
inside
of
him
perhaps
for
the
first
time
a
voice
that
was
disturbingly
adult
they're
ascared
but
that
won't
stop
them
you
got
to
get
away
mikey
or
something
going
to
happen
not
all
of
them
will
want
it
to
happen
maybe
not
victor
and
maybe
not
peter
gordon
but
it
will
happen
anyway
because
henry
will
make
it
happen
so
get
away
get
away
fast
he
backed
up
another
two
or
three
steps
and
then
henry
bowers
said
i
was
the
one
killed
your
dog
nigger
mike
froze
feeling
as
if
he
had
been
hit
in
the
belly
with
a
bowling
ball
he
stared
into
henry
bowers
eyes
and
understood
that
henry
was
telling
the
simple
truth
he
had
killed
mr
chips
that
moment
of
understanding
seemed
nearly
eternal
to
mike
looking
into
henry
crazed
sweatringed
eyes
and
his
rageblackened
face
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
understood
a
great
many
things
for
the
first
time
and
the
fact
that
henry
was
far
crazier
than
mike
had
ever
dreamed
was
only
the
least
of
them
he
realized
above
all
that
the
world
was
wt
kind
and
it
was
more
this
than
the
news
itself
that
forced
the
cry
from
him
you
honky
chickenshit
bastard
henry
uttered
a
shriek
of
rage
and
attacked
the
fence
monkeying
his
way
toward
the
top
with
a
brute
strength
that
was
terrifying
mike
paused
a
moment
longer
wanting
to
see
if
that
adult
voice
that
had
spoken
inside
had
been
a
true
voice
and
yes
it
had
been
true
after
the
slightest
hesitation
the
others
spread
out
and
also
began
to
climb
mike
turned
and
ran
again
sprinting
across
the
trainyards
his
shadow
trailing
squat
at
his
feet
the
freight
which
the
losers
had
seen
crossing
the
barrens
was
long
gone
now
and
there
was
no
sound
but
mike
own
breathing
in
his
ears
and
the
musical
jingle
of
chainlink
as
henry
and
the
others
climbed
the
fence
mike
ran
across
one
triple
set
of
tracks
his
sneakers
kicking
back
cinders
as
he
ran
across
the
space
between
he
stumbled
crossing
the
second
set
of
tracks
and
felt
pain
flare
briefly
in
his
ankle
he
got
up
and
ran
on
again
he
heard
a
thud
as
henry
jumped
down
from
the
top
of
the
fence
behind
him
here
i
come
for
your
ass
nigge
henry
bawled
mike
reasoning
self
had
decided
that
the
barrens
were
his
only
chance
now
if
he
could
get
down
there
he
could
hide
in
the
tangles
of
underbrush
in
the
bamboo
or
if
things
became
really
desperate
he
could
climb
into
one
of
the
drainpipes
and
wait
it
out
he
could
do
those
things
maybe
but
there
was
a
hot
spark
of
fury
in
his
chest
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
his
reasoning
self
he
could
understand
henry
chasing
after
him
when
he
got
the
chance
but
mr
chips
killing
mr
chips
my
dog
wasn't
a
nigger
you
cheapshit
bastard
mike
thought
as
he
ran
and
the
bewildered
anger
grew
now
he
heard
another
voice
this
one
his
father
z
don't
want
you
to
make
a
career
out
of
running
away
and
what
it
all
comes
down
to
is
that
you
have
to
be
careful
where
you
take
your
stand
you
have
to
ask
yourself
if
henry
bowers
is
worth
the
trouble
mike
had
been
running
a
straight
line
across
the
trainyards
toward
the
storage
quonsets
beyond
them
another
chainlink
fence
divided
the
trainyards
from
the
barrens
he
had
been
planning
to
scale
that
fence
and
jump
over
to
the
other
side
instead
he
veered
hard
right
toward
the
gravel
pit
this
gravel
pit
had
been
used
as
a
coalpit
until
or
so
it
had
been
a
stokingpoint
for
the
trains
which
ran
through
the
derry
yards
then
the
diesels
came
and
the
electrics
for
a
number
of
years
after
the
coal
was
gone
much
of
the
remainder
stolen
by
people
with
coal
fired
furnaces
a
local
contractor
had
dug
gravel
there
but
he
went
bust
in
and
since
then
the
pit
had
been
deserted
a
spur
railroad
line
still
ran
in
a
loop
up
to
the
pit
and
then
back
toward
the
switchingyards
but
the
tracks
were
dull
with
rust
and
ragweed
grew
up
between
the
rotting
ties
these
same
weeds
grew
in
the
pit
itself
vying
for
space
with
goldenrod
and
nodding
sunflowers
amid
the
vegetation
there
was
still
plenty
of
slag
coal
the
stuff
people
had
once
called
clinkers
as
mike
ran
toward
this
place
he
took
his
shirt
off
he
reached
the
run
of
the
pit
and
looked
back
henry
was
coming
across
the
tracks
his
buddies
spread
out
around
him
that
was
okay
maybe
moving
as
quickly
as
he
could
using
his
shirt
for
a
bindle
mike
picked
up
half
a
dozen
handfuls
of
hard
clinkers
then
he
ran
back
toward
the
fence
swinging
his
shirt
by
the
arms
instead
of
climbing
the
fence
when
he
reached
it
he
turned
so
his
back
was
against
it
he
dumped
the
coal
out
of
his
shirt
stooped
and
picked
up
a
couple
of
chunks
henry
didn't
see
the
coal
he
only
saw
that
he
had
the
nigger
trapped
against
the
fence
he
sprinted
toward
him
yelling
this
is
for
my
dog
you
bastard
mike
cried
unaware
that
he
had
begun
to
cry
he
threw
one
of
the
chunks
of
coal
overhand
it
flew
in
a
hard
direct
line
it
struck
henry
forehead
with
a
loud
bonk
and
then
rebounded
into
the
air
henry
stumbled
to
his
knees
his
hands
went
to
his
head
blood
seeped
through
his
fingers
at
once
like
a
magician
surprise
the
others
skidded
to
a
stop
their
faces
stamped
with
identical
expressions
of
disbelief
henry
uttered
a
high
scream
of
pain
and
got
to
his
feet
again
still
holding
his
head
mike
threw
another
chunk
of
coal
henry
ducked
he
began
to
walk
toward
mike
and
when
mike
threw
a
third
chunk
of
coal
henry
removed
one
hand
from
his
gashed
forehead
and
batted
the
chunk
of
coal
almost
casually
aside
he
was
grinning
oh
you're
gonna
get
such
a
surprise
he
said
such
a
oh
my
gawd
henry
tried
to
say
more
but
only
inarticulate
gargling
noises
emerged
from
his
mouth
mike
had
pegged
another
chunk
of
coal
and
this
one
had
struck
henry
square
in
the
throat
henry
buckled
to
his
knees
again
peter
gordon
gaped
moose
sadler
brow
was
furrowed
as
if
he
were
trying
to
figure
out
a
difficult
math
problem
what
are
you
guys
waiting
for
henry
managed
blood
seeped
between
his
fingers
his
voice
sounded
rusty
and
foreign
get
him
get
the
little
cocksucker
mike
didn't
wait
to
see
if
they
would
obey
or
not
he
dropped
his
shirt
and
leaped
at
the
fence
he
began
to
pull
himself
up
toward
the
top
and
then
he
felt
rough
hands
grab
his
foot
he
looked
down
and
saw
henry
bowers
contorted
face
smeared
by
blood
and
coal
mike
yanked
his
foot
up
his
sneaker
came
off
in
henry
hand
he
pistoned
his
bare
foot
down
into
henry
face
and
heard
something
crunch
henry
screamed
again
and
staggered
backward
now
holding
his
spouting
nose
another
hand
belch
huggins
snagged
briefly
in
the
cuff
of
mike
leans
but
he
was
able
to
pull
free
he
threw
one
leg
over
the
top
of
the
fence
and
then
something
struck
him
with
blinding
force
on
the
side
of
his
face
warmth
trickled
down
his
cheek
something
else
struck
his
hip
his
forearm
his
upper
thigh
they
were
throwing
his
own
ammunition
at
him
he
hung
briefly
by
his
hands
and
then
dropped
rolling
over
twice
the
scrubby
ground
sloped
downward
here
and
perhaps
that
saved
mike
hanlon
eyesight
or
even
his
life
henry
had
approached
the
fence
again
and
now
looped
one
of
his
four
ms
over
the
top
of
the
fence
it
went
off
with
a
terrific
crrrack
that
echoed
and
blew
a
wide
bare
patch
in
the
grass
mike
his
ears
ringing
went
headoverheels
and
staggered
to
his
feet
he
was
now
in
high
grass
on
the
edge
of
the
barrens
he
wiped
a
hand
down
his
right
cheek
and
it
came
away
bloody
the
blood
did
not
particularly
worry
him
he
had
not
expected
to
come
out
of
this
unscathed
henry
tossed
a
cherrybomb
but
mike
saw
this
one
coming
and
moved
away
easily
let
get
him
henry
roared
and
began
to
climb
the
fence
jeez
henry
i
don't
know
this
had
gone
too
far
for
peter
gordon
who
had
never
encountered
a
situation
that
had
turned
so
suddenly
savage
things
were
not
supposed
to
get
bloody
at
least
not
for
your
team
when
the
odds
were
comfortably
slugged
in
your
favor
you
better
know
henry
said
looking
back
at
peter
from
halfway
up
the
fence
he
hung
there
like
a
bloated
poisonous
spider
in
human
shape
his
baleful
eyes
stared
at
peter
blood
rimmed
them
on
either
side
mike
downward
kick
had
broken
his
nose
although
henry
would
not
be
aware
of
the
fact
for
some
time
yet
you
better
know
or
i'll
come
after
you
you
fucking
jerk
the
others
began
to
climb
the
fence
peter
and
victor
with
some
reluctance
belch
and
moose
as
vacantly
eager
as
before
mike
waited
to
see
no
more
he
turned
and
ran
into
the
scrub
henry
bellowed
after
him
tu
find
you
nigger
i'll
find
you
the
losers
had
reached
the
far
side
of
the
gravelpit
which
was
little
more
than
a
huge
weedy
pockmark
in
the
earth
now
three
years
after
the
last
load
of
gravel
had
been
taken
out
of
it
they
were
all
gathered
around
stan
looking
appreciatively
at
his
package
of
black
cats
when
the
first
explosion
came
eddie
jumped
he
was
still
goofed
up
over
the
piranha
fish
he
thought
he
had
seen
he
wasn't
sure
what
real
piranha
fish
looked
like
but
he
was
pretty
sure
they
didn't
look
like
oversized
goldfish
with
teeth
merrow
down
easy
eddiesa
richie

richie
said
i

earn
your

he
made
dainty
kissing
gestures
at
the
air
bill
shot
him
the
finger
ben
and
eddie
stood
side
by
side
grinning
oh
i'm
so
young
and
you're
so
old
stan
uris

up
suddenly
doing
an
eerily

richie
slung
an

around

and

a
gigantic
gleaming
smile

going
to
grow

out
boy
going
to
give

a
gittar
going
to
bill
popped
richie
twice
on
the
arm
quickly
and
lightly
they
were
all
excited
at
the
prospect
of
shooting
off
firecrackers
open
them
up
stan
beverly
said
tve
got
some
matches
they
gathered
around
again
as
stan
carefully
opened
the
package
of
firecrackers
there
were
exotic
chinese
letters
on
the
black
label
and
a
sober
caution
in
english
that
got
richie
giggling
again
do
not
hold
in
hand
after
fuse
is
li
this
warning
read
good
thing
they
told
me
richie
said
i
always

to
hold
them
after
i
lit
them
i
thought
that
how
you
got
rid
of
your
frockin
hangnails
working
slowly
almost
reverently
stan
removed
the
red
cellophane
and
laid
the
block
of
cardboard
tubes
blue
and
red
and
green
on
the
palm
of
his
hand
ther
fuses
had
been
braided
together
in
a
chinese
pigtail
til
unwind
the
stan
began
and
then
there
was
a
much
louder
explosion
the
echo
rolled
slowly
across
the
barrens
a
cloud
of
gulls
rose
from
the
eastern
side
of
the
dump
squalling
and
crying
they
all
jumped
this
time
stan
dropped
the
firecrackers
and
had
to
pick
them
up
was
that
dynamite
beverly
asked
nervously
she
was
looking
at
bill
whose
head
was
up
his
eyes
wide
she
thought
he
had
never
looked
so
handsome
but
there
was
something
too
alert
too
strungup
in
the
attitude
of
his
head
he
was
like
a
deer
scenting
fire
in
the
air
that
was
an
m
i
think
ben
said
quietly
last
fourth
of
july
i
was
in
the
park
and
there
were
these
highschool
kids
that
had
a
couple
they
put
one
of
them
in
a
steel
trashcan
it
made
a
noise
like
that
did
it
blow
a
hole
in
the
can
haystack
richie
asked
no
but
it
bulged
out
the
side
looked
like
there
was
some
little
guy
inside
who
just
stroked
it
one
they
ran
away
the
big
one
was
closer
eddie
said
he
also
glanced
at
bill
do
you
guys
want
to
shoot
these
off
or
not
stan
asked
he
had
unbraided
about
a
dozen
of
the
firecrackers
and
had
put
the
rest
neatly
back
in
the
waxed
paper
for
later
sure
richie
said
ppput
them
aaaway
they
looked
at
bill
questioningly
a
little
scared
it
was
his
abrupt
tone
more
than
what
he
had
said
pppuhhut
them
aaaawa
bill
repeated
his
face
contorting
with
the
effort
he
was
making
to
get
the
words
out
spit
flew
from
his
lips
sssuhhomething
gggonna
hh
happen
eddie
licked
his
lips
richie
shoved
his
glasses
up
the
sweaty
slope
of
his
nose
with
his
thumb
and
ben
moved
closer
to
beverly
without
even
thinking
about
it
stan
opened
his
mouth
to
say
something
and
then
there
was
another
smaller
explosion
another
cherry
bomb
ruhrock
bill
said
what
bil
stan
asked
ruhruh
rocks
aaammo
bill
began
to
pick
up
stones
stuffing
them
into
his
pockets
until
they
bulged
the
others
stared
at
him
as
though
he
had
gone
crazy
and
then
eddie
felt
sweat
break
on
his
forehead
all
of
a
sudden
he
knew
what
a
malaria
attack
felt
like
he
had
sensed
something
like
this
on
the
day
he
and
bill
had
met
ben
except
eddie
like
the
others
was
already
coming
to
think
of
ben
as
haystack
the
day
henry
bowers
had
casually
bloodied
his
nose
but
this
felt
worse
this
felt
like
maybe
it
was
going
to
be
hiroshima
time
in
the
barrens
ben
started
to
get
rocks
then
richie
moving
quickly
not
talking
now
his
glasses
slipped
all
the
way
off
and
clicked
to
the
gravelly
surface
of
the
ground
he
folded
them
up
absently
and
put
them
inside
his
shirt
why
did
you
do
that
richie
beverly
asked
her
voice
sounded
thin
too
taut
don't
know
kee
richie
said
and
went
on
picking
up
rocks
beverly
maybe
you
better
uh
go
back
toward
the
dump
for
awhile
ben
said
his
hands
were
full
of
rocks
shit
on
that
she
said
shit
all
over
that
ben
hanscom
she
bent
and
began
to
gather
rocks
herself
stan
looked
at
them
thoughtfully
as
they
grubbed
for
rocks
like
lunatic
farmers
then
he
began
to
gather
them
himself
his
lips
pressed
into
a
thin
and
prissy
line
eddie
felt
the
familiar
tightening
sensation
as
his
throat
began
to
close
up
to
a
pinhole
not
this
time
dammit
he
thought
suddenly
not
if
my
friends
need
me
like
bev
said
shit
all
over
that
he
also
began
to
gather
rocks
henry
bowers
had
gotten
too
big
too
fast
to
be
ether
quick
or
agile
under
ordinary
circumstances
but
these
circumstances
were
not
ordinary
he
was
in
a
frenzy
of
pain
and
rage
and
these
lent
him
an
ephemeral
unthinking
physical
genius
conscious
thought
was
gone
his
mind
felt
the
way
a
latesummer
grassfire
looks
as
dusk
comes
on
all
rosered
and
smokegray
he
took
after
mike
hanlon
like
a
bull
after
a
red
flag
mike
was
following
a
rudimentary
path
along
the
side
of
the
big
pit
a
path
which
would
eventually
lead
to
the
dump
but
henry
was
too
far
gone
to
bother
with
such
niceties
as
paths
he
slammed
through
the
bushes
and
the
brambles
on
a
straight
line
feeling
neither
the
tiny
cuts
inflicted
by
the
thorns
nor
the
slaps
of
limber
bushes
striking
his
face
neck
and
arms
the
only
thing
that
mattered
was
the
nigger
kinky
head
drawing
closer
henry
had
one
of
the
ms
in
his
right
hand
and
a
wooden
match
in
his
left
when
he
caught
the
nigger
he
was
going
to
strike
the
match
light
the
fuse
and
stuff
that
ashcan
right
down
the
front
of
his
pants
mike
knew
that
henry
was
gaining
and
the
others
were
close
on
his
heels
he
tried
to
push
himself
faster
he
was
badly
scared
now
keeping
panic
at
bay
only
by
a
grim
effort
of
will
he
had
turned
his
ankle
more
seriously
crossing
the
tracks
than
he
had
thought
at
first
and
now
he
was
limpskipping
along
the
crackle
and
crash
of
henry
goforbroke
progress
behind
him
called
up
unpleasant
images
of
being
chased
by
a
killer
dog
or
a
rogue
bear
the
path
opened
out
just
ahead
and
mike
more
fell
than
ran
into
the
gravelpit
he
rolled
to
the
bottom
got
to
his
feet
and
was
halfway
across
before
he
realized
that
there
were
kids
there
six
of
them
they
were
spread
out
in
a
straight
line
and
there
was
a
funny
look
on
their
faces
it
wasn't
until
hter
when
he'd
had
a
chance
to
sort
out
his
thoughts
that
he
realized
what
was
so
odd
about
that
look
it
was
as
if
they
had
been
expecting
him
help
mike
managed
as
he
limped
toward
them
he
spoke
instinctively
to
the
tall
boy
with
the
red
hair
kids
big
kids
that
was
when
henry
burst
into
the
gravelpit
he
saw
the
six
of
them
and
came
to
a
skidding
halt
for
a
moment
his
face
was
marked
with
uncertainty
and
he
looked
back
over
his
shoulder
he
saw
his
troops
and
when
henry
looked
back
at
the
losers
mike
was
now
standing
beside
and
slightly
behind
bill
denbrough
panting
rapidly
he
was
grinning
i
know
you
kid
he
said
speaking
to
bill
he
glanced
at
richie
i
know
you
too
where
your
glasses
foureyes
and
before
richie
could
reply
henry
saw
ben
well
son
of
a
bitch
the
jew
and
the
fatboy
are
here
too
that
your
girlfriend
fatboy
ben
jumped
a
little
as
if
goosed
just
then
peter
gordon
pulled
up
beside
henry
victor
arrived
and
stood
on
henry
other
side
belch
and
moose
sadler
arrived
last
they
flanked
peter
and
victor
and
now
the
two
opposing
groups
stood
facing
each
other
in
neat
almost
formal
lines
panting
heavily
as
he
spoke
and
still
sounding
more
than
a
little
like
a
human
bull
henry
said
i
got
bones
to
pick
with
a
lot
of
you
but
i
can
let
that
go
for
today
i
want

shits

belch
said
smartly
he
killed
my
dog
mike
cried
out
his
voice
shrill
and
breaking
he
said
so
you
come
on
over
here
right
now
henry
said
and
maybe
i
won't
kill
you
mike
trembled
but
did
not
move
speaking
softly
and
clearly
bill
said
the
bbarrens
are
ours
you
kkkids
get
out
of
here
henry
eyes
widened
it
was
as
if
he'd
been
slapped
unexpectedly
who
gonna
make
me
he
asked
you
horsefoo
uhuh
us
bill
said
we're
through
tt
taking
your
shit
b
b
bowers
get
owow
out
you
stuttering
freak
henry
said
he
lowered
his
head
and
charged
bill
had
a
handful
of
rocks
all
of
them
had
a
handful
except
mike
and
beverly
who
was
only
holding
one
bill
began
to
throw
at
henry
not
hurrying
his
throws
but
chucking
hard
and
with
fair
accuracy
the
first
rock
missed
the
second
struck
henry
on
the
shoulder
if
the
third
had
missed
henry
might
have
closed
with
bill
and
wrestled
him
to
the
ground
but
it
didn't
miss
it
struck
henry
lowered
head
henry
cried
out
in
surprised
pain
looked
up
and
was
hit
four
more
times
a
little
billet
doux
from
richie
tozier
on
the
chest
one
from
eddie
that
ricocheted
off
his
shoulder
blade
one
from
stan
uris
that
struck
his
shin
and
beverly
one
rock
which
hit
him
in
the
belly
he
looked
at
them
unbelievingly
and
suddenly
the
air
was
full
of
whizzing
missiles
henry
fell
back
that
same
bewildered
pained
expression
on
his
face
come
on
you
guys
he
shouted
help
me”
chchcharge
them
bill
said
in
a
low
voice
and
not
waiting
to
see
if
they
would
or
not
he
ran
forward
they
came
with
him
firing
rocks
not
only
at
henry
now
but
at
all
the
others
the
big
boys
were
grubbing
on
the
ground
for
ammunition
of
their
own
but
before
they
could
gather
much
they
had
been
peppered
peter
gordon
screamed
as
a
rock
thrown
by
ben
glanced
off
his
cheekbone
and
drew
blood
he
backed
up
a
few
steps
paused
threw
a
hesitant
rock
or
two
back
and
then
fled
he
had
had
enough
things
were
not
done
this
way
on
west
broadway
henry
grabbed
up
a
handful
of
rocks
in
a
savage
sweeping
gesture
most
of
them
fortunately
for
the
losers
were
pebbles
he
threw
one
of
the
larger
ones
at
beverly
and
it
cut
her
arm
she
cried
out
bellowing
ben
ran
for
henry
bowers
who
looked
around
in
time
to
see
him
coming
but
not
in
time
to
sidestep
henry
was
offbalance
ben
was
one
hundred
and
fifty
trying
for
one
sixty
the
result
was
no
contest
henry
did
not
go
sprawling
but
flying
he
landed
on
his
back
and
skidded
ben
ran
toward
him
again
and
was
only
vaguely
aware
of
a
warm
blooming
pain
in
his
ear
as
belch
huggins
nailed
him
with
a
rock
roughly
the
size
of
a
golf
ball
henry
was
getting
groggily
to
his
knees
as
ben
reached
him
and
kicked
him
hard
his
sneakered
foot
connecting
solidly
with
henry
left
hip
henry
rolled
over
heavily
on
his
back
his
eyes
blazed
up
at
ben
you
ain't
supposed
to
throw
rocks
at
girls
ben
shouted
he
could
not
remember
ever
in
his
life
feeling
so
outraged
you
aint
then
he
saw
a
flame
in
henry
hand
as
henry
popped
the
wooden
match
alight
he
touched
it
to
the
thick
fuse
of
the
m
which
he
then
threw
at
ben
face
acting
with
no
thought
at
all
ben
struck
the
ashcan
with
the
palm
of
his
hand
swinging
at
it
as
one
would
swing
a
racket
at
a
badminton
birdie
the
m
went
back
down
henry
saw
it
coming
his
eyes
widened
and
then
he
rolled
away
screaming
the
ashcan
exploded
a
splitsecond
later
blackening
the
back
of
henry
shirt
and
tearing
some
of
it
away
a
moment
later
ben
was
hit
by
moose
sadler
and
driven
to
his
knees
his
teeth
clicked
together
over
his
tongue
drawing
blood
he
blinked
around
dazed
moose
was
coming
toward
him
but
before
he
could
reach
the
place
where
ben
was
kneeling
bill
came
up
behind
him
and
began
pelting
the
big
kid
with
rocks
moose
wheeled
around
bellowing
you
hit
me
from
behind
yellowbelly
moose
screamed
you
fuckin
dirtyfighte
he
gathered
himself
to
charge
but
richie
joined
bill
and
also
began
to
fire
rocks
at
moose
richie
was
unimpressed
with
moose
rhetoric
on
the
subject
of
what
might
or
might
not
constitute
yellowbelly
behavior
he
had
seen
the
five
of
them
chasing
one
scared
kid
and
he
didn't
think
that
exactly
put
them
up
there
with
king
arthur
and
the
knights
of
the
round
table
one
of
richie
missiles
split
the
skin
above
moose
lef
eyebrow
moose
howled
eddie
and
stan
uris
moved
up
to
join
bill
and
richie
beverly
moved
in
with
them
her
arm
bleeding
but
her
eyes
wildly
alight
rocks
flew
belch
huggins
screamed
as
one
of
them
clipped
his
crazy
bone
he
began
to
dance
lumbersomely
rubbing
his
elbow
henry
got
to
his
feet
the
back
of
his
shirt
hanging
in
rags
the
skin
beneath
almost
miraculously
unmarked
before
he
could
turn
around
ben
hanscom
bounced
a
rock
off
the
back
of
his
head
and
drove
him
to
his
knees
again
it
was
victor
criss
who
did
the
most
damage
to
the
losers
that
day
partly
because
he
was
a
pretty
fair
fastball
pitcher
but
mostly
paradoxically
because
he
was
the
least
emotionally
involved
more
and
more
he
didn't
want
to
be
here
people
could
get
seriously
hurt
in
rockfights
a
kid
could
get
his
skull
split
a
mouthful
of
broken
teeth
could
even
lose
an
eye
but
since
he
was
in
it
he
was
in
it
he
intended
to
dish
out
some
trouble
that
coolness
had
allowed
him
to
take
an
extra
thirty
seconds
and
pick
up
a
handful
of
goodsized
rocks
he
threw
one
at
eddie
as
the
losers
reformed
their
rough
skirmish
line
and
it
struck
eddie
on
the
chin
he
fell
down
crying
the
blood
already
starting
to
flow
ben
turned
toward
him
but
eddie
was
already
getting
up
again
the
blood
gruesomely
bright
against
his
pallid
skin
his
eyes
slitted
victor
threw
at
richie
and
the
rock
thudded
off
richie
chest
richie
threw
back
but
vie
ducked
it
easily
and
threw
one
sidearm
at
bill
denbrough
bill
snapped
his
head
back
but
not
quite
quickly
enough
the
rock
cut
his
cheek
wide
open
bill
turned
toward
victor
their
eyes
locked
and
victor
saw
something
in
the
stuttering
kid
gaze
that
scared
the
hell
out
of
him
absurdly
the
words
i
take
it
back
trembled
behind
his
lips
except
that
was
nothing
you
said
to
a
little
kid
not
if
you
didn't
want
your
buddies
to
start
ranking
you
to
the
dogs
and
back
bill
started
to
walk
toward
victor
now
and
victor
began
to
walk
toward
bill
at
the
same
moment
as
if
by
some
telepathic
signal
they
began
to
throw
rocks
at
each
other
still
closing
the
distance
the
righting
flagged
around
them
as
the
others
turned
to
watch
even
henry
turned
his
head
victor
ducked
and
bobbed
but
bill
made
no
such
effort
victor
rocks
slammed
him
in
the
chest
the
shoulder
the
stomach
one
clipped
by
his
ear
apparently
unshaken
by
any
of
this
bill
threw
one
rock
after
another
pegging
them
with
murderous
force
the
third
one
struck
victor
knee
with
a
brittle
chipping
sound
and
victor
uttered
a
stifled
groan
he
was
out
of
ammunition
bill
had
one
rock
left
it
was
smooth
and
white
shot
with
quartz
roughly
the
size
and
shape
of
a
duck
egg
to
victor
criss
it
looked
very
hard
bill
was
less
than
five
feet
away
from
him
yyyou

of

he
said
or
i'm
ggoing
to

your

ooopen
i
m
mean
ihihit
looking
into
his
eyes
victor
saw
that
he
really
did
without
another
word
he
turned
and
headed
back
the
way
peter
gordon
had
gone
belch
and
moose
sadler
were
looking
around
uncertainly
blood
trickled
from
the
corner
of
the
sadler
boy
mouth
and
blood
from
a
scalpwound
was
sheeting
down
the
side
of
belch
face
henry
mouth
worked
but
no
sound
came
out
bill
turned
toward
henry
ggget
ou
he
said
what
if
i
won't
henry
was
trying
to
sound
tough
but
bill
could
now
see
a
different
thing
in
henry
eyes
he
was
scared
and
he
would
go
it
should
have
made
bill
feel
good
triumphant
even
but
he
only
felt
tired
lif
you
wwon't

joined
them
he
had
a
softballsized
rock
in
each
hand
just
try
me
bowers
i'd
love
to
you
fucking
nigger
henry
voice
broke
and
wavered
on
the
edge
of
tears
that
voice
took
the
last
of
the
fight
out
of
belch
and
moose
they
backed
away
their
remaining
rocks
dropping
from
relaxing
hands
belch
looked
around
as
if
wondering
exactly
where
he
might
be
get
out
of
our
place
beverly
said
shut
up
you
cunt
henry
said
you
four
rocks
flew
at
once
hitting
henry
in
four
different
places
he
screamed
and
scrambled
backward
over
the
weedraddled
ground
the
tatters
of
his
shirt
flapping
around
him
he
looked
from
the
grim
oldyoung
faces
of
the
little
kids
to
the
frantic
ones
of
belch
and
moose
there
was
no
help
there
no
help
at
all
moose
turned
away
embarrassed
henry
got
to
his
feet
sobbing
and
snuffling
through
his
broken
nose
ti
kill
you
all
he
said
and
suddenly
ran
for
the
path
a
moment
later
he
was
gone
gggo
o
bill
said
speaking
to
belch
get
owout
and
ddon't
¢ccome
down
irhere
anymore
the
bb
barrens

owowours
you're
gonna
wish
you
didn't
cross
henry
kid
belch
said
come
on
moose
they
started
away
heads
down
not
looking
back
the
seven
of
them
stood
in
a
loose
semicircle
all
of
them
bleeding
somewhere
the
apocalyptic
rockfight
had
lasted
less
than
four
minutes
but
bill
felt
as
if
he
had
fought
his
way
through
all
of
world
war
ii
both
theaters
without
so
much
as
a
single
timeout
the
silence
was
broken
by
eddie
kaspbrak
whooping
whining
struggle
for
air
ben
went
toward
him
felt
the
three
twinkies
and
four
dingdongs
he
had
eaten
on
his
way
down
to
the
barrens
begin
to
struggle
and
churn
in
his
stomach
and
ran
past
eddie
and
into
the
bushes
where
he
was
sick
as
privately
and
quietly
as
he
could
be
it
was
richie
and
bev
who
went
to
eddie
beverly
put
an
arm
around
the
thin
boy
waist
while
richie
dug
his
aspirator
out
of
his
pocket
bite
on
this
eddie
he
said
and
eddie
took
a
hitching
gasping
breath
as
richie
pulled
the
trigger
thank
eddie
managed
at
last
ben
came
back
out
of
the
bushes
blushing
wiping
a
hand
over
his
mouth
beverly
went
over
to
him
and
took
both
of
his
hands
in
hers
thanks
for
sticking
up
for
me
she
said
ben
nodded
looking
at
his
dirty
sneakers
any
time
kee
he
said
one
by
one
they
turned
to
look
at
mike
mike
with
his
dark
skin
they
looked
at
him
carefully
cautiously
thoughtfully
mike
had
felt
such
curiosity
before
there
had
not
been
a
time
in
his
life
when
he
had
not
felt
itand
he
looked
back
candidly
enough
bill
looked
from
mike
to
richie
richie
met
his
eyes
and
bill
seemed
almost
to
hear
the
click
some
final
part
fitting
neatly
into
a
machine
of
unknown
intent
he
felt
icechips
scatter
up
his
back
we're
all
together
now
he
thought
and
the
idea
was
so
strong
so
right
that
for
a
moment
he
thought
he
might
have
spoken
it
aloud
but
of
course
there
was
no
need
to
speak
it
aloud
he
could
see
it
in
richie
eyes
in
ben
in
eddie
in
beverly
in
stan
we're
all
together
now
he
thought
again
oh
god
help
us
now
it
really
starts
please
god
help
us
what
your
name
kid
beverly
asked
mike
hanlon
you
want
to
shoot
off
some
firecrackers
stan
asked
and
mike
grin
was
answer
enough
chapter
the
album
as
it
turns
out
bill
isn't
the
only
one
they
all
bring
booze
bill
has
bourbon
beverly
has
vodka
and
a
carton
of
orange
juice
richie
a
sixpack
ben
hanscom
a
bottle
of
wild
turkey
mike
has
a
sixpack
in
the
little
refrigerator
in
the
staff
lounge
eddie
kaspbrak
comes
in
last
holding
a
small
brown
bag
what
you
got
there
eddi
richie
asks
zarex
or
koolai
smiling
nervously
eddie
removes
first
a
bottle
of
gin
and
then
a
bottle
of
prune
juice
in
the
thunderstruck
silence
which
follows
richie
says
quietly
somebody
call
for
the
men
in
the
white
coats
eddie
kaspbrak’s
finally
gone
over
the
top
ginandprune
juice
happens
to
be
very
health
eddie
replies
defensively
and
then
they're
all
hughing
wildly
the
sound
of
their
mirth
echoing
and
reechoing
in
the
silent
library
rolling
up
and
down
the
glassedin
hall
between
the
adult
library
and
the
children
library
you
go
heado
ben
says
wiping
his
streaming
eyes
you
go
headon
eddie
i
bet
it
really
moves
the
mail
too
smiling
eddie
fills
a
paper
cup
threequarters
full
of
prune
juice
and
then
soberly
adds
two
capfuls
of
gin
oh
eddie
i
do
love
yo
beverly
says
and
eddie
looks
up
startled
but
smiling
she
gazes
up
and
down
the
table
love
all
of
you
bill
says
wwe
love
you
too
bbev
yes
ben
says
we
love
you
his
eyes
widen
a
little
and
he
laughs
think
we
still
all
love
each
other
do
you
know
how
rare
that
must
b
there
a
moment
of
silence
and
mike
is
really
not
surprised
to
see
that
rickie
is
wearing
his
glasses
my
contacts
started
to
burn
and
i
had
to
take
them
ou
richie
says
briefly
when
mike
asks
maybe
we
should
get
down
to
business
'
they
all
look
at
bill
then
as
they
had
in
the
gravelpit
and
mike
thinks
they
look
at
bill
when
they
need
a
leader
at
eddie
when
they
need
a
navigator
get
down
to
business
what
a
hell
of
a
phrase
that
is
do
i
tell
them
that
the
bodies
of
the
children
that
were
found
back
then
and
now
weren't
sexually
molested
not
even
precisely
mutilated
but
partially
eaten
do
i
tell
them
i've
got
seven
miner
helmets
the
kind
with
strong
electric
lights
set
into
the
front
stored
back
at
my
house
one
of
them
for
a
guy
named
stan
uris
who
couldn't
make
the
scene
as
we
used
to
say
or
is
it
maybe
enough
just
to
tell
them
to
go
home
and
get
a
good
night
sleep
because
it
ends
tomorrow
or
tomorrow
night
for
good
either
for
it
or
us
none
of
those
things
have
to
be
said
perhaps
and
the
reason
why
they
don't
has
already
been
stated
they
still
love
one
another
things
have
changed
over
the
last
twentyseven
years
but
that
miraculously
hasn't
it
is
mike
thinks
our
only
real
hope
the
only
thing
that
really
remains
is
to
finish
going
through
it
to
complete
the
job
of
catching
up
of
stapling
past
to
present
so
that
the
strip
of
experience
forms
some
halfassed
kind
of
wheel
yes
mike
thinks

still
smiling

and
punching
his
glasses
up
on

gesture
that
is
eerily
reminiscent
of
the
old
richie

says
sitting
suddenly
bolt
upright
and
the
pictures
richie
nods
grimly
the
same
trick
as
in
georgie
room
only
that
time
we
all
saw

remembered
what
happened
to

extra
silver

friend

quietly

i
couldn't

at

a
silver
slug

richie
agrees
but
in
the
end
we
got
ccold
fuhfeet
bill
nods
slowly
the
memory
has
fallen
naturally
into
its
place
and
he
hears
that
same
low
but
distinct
click
when
it
happens
we're
getting
closer
he
thinks
we
went
back
to
neibolt
stree
richie
says
all
of

life
big
bil
ben
says
suddenly
and
bill
shakes
his
head
you
did
thoug
ben
persists
and
this
time
bill
doesn't
shake
his
head
he
suspects
that
maybe
he
had
done
just
that
although
he
does
not
yet
remember
how
and
was
it
him
he
thinks
maybe
beverly
but
that
is
not
there
not
yet

secon

says

richie

mike
replies
especially
not
yours
trashmouth
beepbeep
mike
rickie
says
solemnly
and
mike
goes
to
get
his
beer
on
a
warm
wave
of
their
laughter
he
snaps
on
the
light
in
the
lounge
a
tacky
little
room
with
seedy
chairs
a
silex
badly
in
need
of
scrubbing
and
a
bulletin
board
covered
with
old
notices
wage
and
hour
information
and
a
few
new
yorker
cartoons
now
turning
yellow
and
curling
up
at
the
edges
he
opens
the
little
refrigerator
and
feels
the
shock
sink
into
him
bonedeep
and
icewhite
the
way
february
cold
sank
into
you
when
february
was
here
and
it
seemed
that
april
never
would
be
blue
and
orange
balloons
drift
out
in
a
flood
dozens
of
them
a
new
year
eve
bouquet
of
partyballoons
and
he
thinks
incoherently
in
the
midst
of
his
fear
all
we
need
is
guy
lombardo
tootling
away
on
auld
lang
syne
they
waft
past
his
face
and
rise
toward
the
lounge
ceiling
he
trying
to
scream
unable
to
scream
seeing
what
had
been
behind
the
balloons
what
it
had
popped
into
the
refrigerator
beside
his
beer
as
if
for
a
latenight
snack
after
his
worthless
friends
have
all
told
their
worthless
stones
and
gone
back
to
their
rented
beds
in
this
home
town
that
is
no
longer
home
mike
takes
a
step
backward
his
hands
going
to
his
face
shutting
the
vision
out
he
stumbles
over
one
of
the
chairs
almost
falls
and
takes
his
hands
away
it
is
still
there
stan
uris
severed
head
beside
mike
sixpack
of
bud
light
the
head
not
of
a
man
but
of
an
elevenyearold
boy
the
mouth
is
open
in
a
soundless
scream
but
mike
can
see
neither
teeth
nor
tongue
because
the
mouth
has
been
stuffed
full
of
feathers
the
feathers
are
a
light
brown
and
unspeakably
huge
he
knows
well
enough
what
bird
those
feathers
came
from
oh
yes
oh
yes
indeed
he
had
seen
the
bird
in
may
of
and
they
had
all
seen
it
in
early
august
of
and
then
years
later
while
visiting
his
dying
father
he
had
found
out
that
will
hanlon
had
seen
it
once
too
after
his
escape
from
the
fire
at
the
black
spot
the
blood
from
s
tan
tattered
neck
has
dripped
down
and
formed
a
coagulated
pool
on
the
fridge
bottom
shelf
it
glitters
dark
rubyred
in
the
uncompromising
glow
shed
by
the
fridge
bulb
uh...uh...uh
mike
manages
but
no
more
sound
than
that
can
he
make
then
the
head
opens
its
eyes
and
they
are
the
silverbright
eyes
of
pennywise
the
clown
those
eyes
roll
in
his
direction
and
the
head
lips
begin
to
squirm
around
the
mouthful
of
feathers
it
is
trying
to
speak
perhaps
trying
to
deliver
prophecy
like
the
oracle
in
a
greek
play
just
thought
i'd
join
you
mike
because
you
can't
win
without
me
you
can't
win
without
me
and
you
know
it
don't
you
you
might
have
had
a
chance
if
all
of
me
had
shown
up
but
i
just
couldn't
stand
the
strain
on
my
al
american
brain
if
you
see
what
i
mean
jellybean
ai
the
six
of
you
can
do
on
your
own
is
hash
over
some
old
times
and
then
get
yourselves
killed
so
i
thought
i'd
head
you
off
at
the
pass
head
you
off
get
it
mikey
get
it
old
pal
get
it
you
fucking
scumbag
nigger
you're
not
real
he
screams
but
no
sound
comes
out
he
is
like
a
tv
with
the
volume
control
turned
all
the
way
down
incredibly
grotesquely
the
head
winks
at
him
i'm
real
all
right
real
as
raindrops
and
you
know
what
i'm
talking
about
mikey
what
the
six
of
you
are
planning
to
try
is
like
taking
off
in
a
jet
plane
with
no
landing
gear
there
no
sense
in
going
up
if
you
can't
get
back
down
is
there
no
sense
in
going
down
if
you
can't
get
back
up
either
you'll
never
think
of
the
right
riddles
and
jokes
you'll
never
nake
me
laugh
mikey
you've
all
forgotten
how
to
turn
your
screams
upsidedown
beepbeep
mikey
what
do
you
say
remember
the
bird
nothing
but
a
sparrow
but
sayhey
it
was
a
lulu
wasn't
it
big
as
a
barn
big
as
one
of
those
silly
japanese
movie
monsters
that
used
to
scare
you
when
you
were
a
little
kid
the
days
when
you
knew
how
to
turn
that
bird
from
your
door
are
gone
forever
believe
it
mikey
if
you
know
how
to
use
your
head
you'll
get
out
of
here
out
of
derry
right
now
if
you
don't
know
how
to
use
it
it'll
end
up
just
like
this
one
here
today
guidepost
along
the
great
road
of
life
is
use
it
before
you
lose
it
my
good
man
the
head
rolls
over
on
its
face
the
feathers
in
its
mouth
make
a
horrid
crumpling
sound
and
falls
out
of
the
refrigerator
it
thuks
to
the
floor
and
rolls
toward
him
like
a
hideous
bowling
ball
its
bloodmatted
hair
changing
places
with
its
grinning
face
it
rolls
toward
him
leaving
a
gluey
trail
of
blood
and
dismembered
bits
of
feather
behind
its
mouth
working
around
its
clot
of
feathers
beepbeep
mikey
it
screams
as
mike
backs
madly
away
from
it
hands
held
out
in
a
wardingoff
gesture
beepbeep
beepbeep
beepfuckingbeep
then
there
is
a
sudden
loud
pop
the
sound
of
a
plastic
cork
thumbed
out
of
a
bottle
of
cheap
champagne
the
head
disappears
real
mike
thinks
sickly
there
was
nothing
supernatural
about
that
pop
anyway
that
was
the
sound
of
air
rushing
back
into
a
suddenly
vacated
space
real
oh
god
real
a
thin
net
of
blood
droplets
floats
up
and
then
patters
back
down
no
need
to
clean
the
lounge
though
carole
will
see
nothing
when
she
comes
in
tomorrow
not
even
if
she
has
to
plow
her
way
through
the
balloons
to
get
to
the
hotplate
and
make
her
first
cup
of
coffee
how
handy
he
giggles
shrilly
he
looks
up
and
yes
the
balloons
are
still
there
the
blue
ones
say
derry
niggers
get
the
bird
the
orange
ones
say
the
losers
are
still
losing
but
stanley
uris
is
finally
ahead
no
sense
going
up
if
you
can't
get
back
down
the
speaking
head
had
assured
him
no
sense
going
down
if
you
can't
get
back
up
this
latter
makes
him
think
again
of
the
stored
miner
helmets
and
was
it
true
suddenly
he
thinking
about
the
first
day
he
went
down
to
the
barrens
after
the
rockfight
july
th
that
had
been
two
days
after
he
had
marched
in
the
fourth
of
july
parade
two
days
after
he
had
seen
pennywise
the
clown
in
person
for
the
first
time
it
had
been
after
that
day
in
the
barrens
after
listening
to
their
stones
and
then
hesitantly
telling
his
own
that
he
had
gone
home
and
asked
his
father
if
he
could
look
at
his
photograph
album
why
exactly
had
he
gone
down
to
the
barrens
that
july
th
had
he
known
he
would
find
them
there
it
seemed
that
he
had
and
not
just
that
they
would
be
there
but
where
they
would
be
they
had
been
talking
about
a
clubhouse
of
some
sort
he
remembers
but
it
had
seemed
to
him
that
they
had
been
talking
about
that
because
there
was
something
else
that
they
didn't
know
how
to
talk
about
mike
looks
up
at
the
balloons
not
really
seeing
them
now
trying
to
remember
exactly
how
it
had
been
that
day
that
hot
hot
day
suddenly
it
seems
very
important
to
remember
just
what
had
happened
what
every
nuance
had
been
what
his
state
of
mind
had
been
because
that
was
when
everything
began
to
happen
before
that
the
others
had
talked
about
killing
it
but
there
had
been
no
forward
motion
no
plan
when
mike
had
come
the
circle
closed
the
wheel
began
to
roll
it
had
been
later
that
same
day
that
bill
and
richie
and
ben
went
down
to
the
library
and
began
to
do
serious
research
on
an
idea
that
bill
had
had
a
day
or
a
week
or
a
month
before
it
had
all
begun
to
mik
richie
calls
from
the
reference
room
where
the
others
are
gathered
did
you
die
in
ther
almost
mike
thinks
looking
at
the
balloons
the
blood
the
feathers
inside
the
fridge
he
calls
back
i
think
you
guys
better
come
in
here
he
hears
the
scrape
of
their
chairs
the
mutter
of
their
voices
he
hears
richie
saying
oh
jesus
what
up
no
and
another
ear
this
one
in
his
memory
hears
richie
saying
something
else
and
suddenly
he
remembers
what
it
is
he
has
been
searching
for
even
more
he
understands
why
it
has
seemed
so
elusive
the
reaction
of
the
others
when
he
stepped
into
the
clearing
in
the
darkest
deepest
and
most
overgrown
part
of
the
barrens
that
day
had
been
nothing
no
surprise
no
questions
about
how
he
had
found
them
no
big
deal
ben
had
been
eating
a
twinkie
he
remembers
beverly
and
richie
had
been
smoking
cigarettes
bill
had
been
lying
on
his
back
with
his
hands
behind
his
head
looking
at
the
sky
eddie
and
stan
were
looking
doubtfully
at
a
series
of
strings
which
had
been
pegged
into
the
ground
to
form
a
square
of
about
five
feet
on
a
side
no
surprise
no
questions
no
big
deal
he
had
simply
shown
up
and
been
accepted
it
was
as
if
without
even
knowing
it
they
had
been
waiting
for
him
and
in
that
third
ear
memory
ear
he
hears
richie
pickaninny
voice
raised
as
it
was
earlier
tonight
lawdy
miss
clawdy
here

to
look
at

there
nappy
haid
big
bill
bill
didn't
even
look
around
he
just
went
on
staring
dreamily
at
the
fat
summer
clouds
marching
across
the
sky
he
was
giving
an
important
question
his
most
careful
consideration
richie
was
not
offended
by
the
lack
of
attention
however
he
pushed
onward
jest
lookin
at
that
nappy
haid
makes
me
b'leeve

beep
beep
richie
ben
said
from
around
a
mouthful
of
twinkie
and
beverly
laughed
hi
mike
said
uncertainly
his
heart
was
beating
a
little
too
hard
but
he
vas
determined
to
go
on
with
this
he
owed
his
thanks
and
his
father
had
told
him
that
you
always
paid
what
you
owed
and
as
quick
as
you
could
before
the
interest
mounted
up
stan
looked
around
hi
he
said
and
then
looked
back
at
the
square
of
srings
pegged
into
the
center
of
the
clearing
ben
are
you
sure
this
is
going
to
work

ben
said
hi

took
a
deep
breath
and
said
i
wanted
to
thank

again
for
helping
me
the
other
day
those
guys
meant

dismissing

dddon't

he
sat
up
and
looked
at
mike
with
sudden
starry
interest
c
can
i
aask
you
sssomething
guess
so
mike
said
he
sat
down
gingerly
he
had
heard
such
prefaces
before
the
denbrough
kid
was
going
to
ask
him
what
it
was
like
to
be
a
negro
but
instead
bill
said
when
lllarsen
pitched
the
nmnohhitter
in
the
world
sseries
two
years
ago
ddo
you
think
that
was
just
lub
luck
richie
dragged
deep
on
his
cigarette
and
started
to
cough
beverly
pounded
nun
good
naturedly
on
the
back
you're
just
a
beginner
richie
you'll
learn
i
think

fall
in
ben
eddie
said
worriedly
looking
at
the
pegged
square
i
don't
know
how
cool
i
am
on
the
idea
of
getting
buried
alive
you're
not
gonna
get
buried
alive
ben
said
and
if
you
are
just
suck
your
damn
old
aspirator
until
someone
pulls
you
out
this
struck
stanley
uris
as
deliciously
funny
he
leaned
back
on
his
elbow
his
head
turned
up
to
the
sky
and
laughed
until
eddie
kicked
his
shin
and
told
him
to
shut
up
luc
mike
said
finally
i
think
any
nohitter
more
luck
than
skill
mmme
ttoo
bill
said
mike
waited
to
see
if
there
was
more
but
bill
seemed
satisfied
he
lay
down
again
laced
his
hands
behind
his
head
again
and
went
back
to
studying
the
clouds
as
they
floated
by
what
are
you
guys
up
to
mike
asked
looking
at
the
square
of
strings
pegged
just
above
the
ground
oh

is
haystack

idea
of

mike
said
well
it
pretty
simple
ben
said
they
wanted
a
treehouse
and
we
could
do
that
but

a
bad
habit
of
breaking
their
bones
when
they
fall
out
of
treehouses
kookie
kookie

stan
said
and
laughed
again
while
the
others
looked
at
him
puzzled
stan
did
not
have
much
sense
of
humor
and
the
bit
he
did
have
was
sort
of
peculiar

is

five
feet
in
the
square
i
pegged
out
there
we

go
much
deeper
than
that
or
we'll
hit
groundwater
i

pretty
close
to
the
surface
down
here
then
we'll
shore
up
the
sides
just
to
make
sure
they
don't
cave
in
he
looked
significantly
at
eddie
here
but
eddie
was
worried
then
wha
mike
asked

cap

the
top

the
top

beverly

up
from

richie
immediately
began
to
crawl
toward
her
on
his
hands
and
knees
i

he
said
making
dog
eyes
at
her

a
pinestudded
bungalow

what
beverly
asked
while
ben
watched

an
odd
mixture
of
anxiety
amusement
and
concentration
a
bungstudded
pinealo
richie
said
five
bucks

sweetie

beverly
laughed
and
blushed
and
moved
away
from
him
we
sh
share
the
eexpenses
bill
said
that
why
we
got
a
club
so
after
we
cap
the
hole
with
boards
ben
went
on
we
put
down
this
heavyduty
glue
tangletrack
they
call
it
and
put
the
sods
back
on
maybe
sprinkle
it
with
pine
needles
we
could
be
down
there
and
people
people
like
henry
bowers
could
walk
right
over
us
and
not
even
know
we
were
there
you
thought
of
that
mike
said
jeez
that
great
ben
smiled
it
was
his
turn
to
blush
bill
sat
up
suddenly
and
looked
at
mike
you
w
w
want
to
hehhel
well
sure
mike
said
that'd
be
fun
a
look
passed
among
the
others
mike
felt
it
as
well
as
saw
it
there
are
seven
of
us
here
mike
thought
and
for
no
reason
at
all
he
shivered
when
are
you
going
to
break
ground
pphretty
ssoo
bill
said
and
mike
knew
knew
that
it
wasn't
just
ben
underground
clubhouse
bill
was
talking
about
ben
knew
it
too
so
did
richie
beverly
and
eddie
stan
uris
had
stopped
smiling
wwe're
ggonna
start
this
pruhhuhhoject
pretty
suhsuhsoon
there
was
a
pause
then
and
mike
was
suddenly
aware
of
two
things
they
wanted
to
say
something
tell
him
something
and
he
was
not
entirely
sure
he
wanted
to
hear
it
ben
had
picked
up
a
stick
and
was
doodling
aimlessly
in
the
dirt
his
hair
hiding
his
face
richie
was
gnawing
at
his
already
ragged
fingermils
only
bill
was
looking
directly
at
mike
is
something
wrong
mike
asked
uneasily
speaking
very
slowly
bill
said
wwwe're
a
cluhclub
y
you
can
be
in
the
club
if
you
wwwant
but
y
y
you
have
to
keekeep
our
seesee
secrets
you
mean
like
the
clubhouse
mike
asked
now
more
uneasy
than
ever
well
sure
we've
got
another
secret
kid
richie
said
still
not
looking
at
mike
and
big
bill
says
we've
got
something
more
important
to
do
this
summer
than
digging
underground
clubhouses
he
right
to
ben
added
there
was
a
sudden
whistling
gasp
mike
jumped
it
was
only
eddie
blasting
off
eddie
looked
at
mike
apologetically
shrugged
and
then
nodded
well
mike
said
finally
don't
keep
me
in
suspense
tell
me
bill
was
looking
at
the
others
his
there
aaanyone
who
ddoesn't
want
him
in
the
cluh
club
no
one
spoke
or
raised
a
hand
w
who
wants
to
ttel
bill
asked
there
was
another
long
pause
and
this
time
bill
didn't
break
it
at
last
beverly
sighed
and
looked
up
at
mike
the
kids
who
have
been
killed
she
said
we
know
who
been
doing
it
and
it
not
human
they
told
him
one
by
one
the
clown
on
the
ice
the
leper
under
the
porch
the
blood
and
voices
from
the
drain
the
dead
boys
in
the
standpipe
richie
told
about
what
had
happened
when
he
and
bill
went
back
to
neibolt
street
and
bill
spoke
last
telling
about
the
school
photo
that
had
moved
and
the
picture
he
had
stuck
his
hand
into
he
finished
by
explaining
that
it
had
killed
his
brother
georgie
and
that
the
loser
club
was
dedicated
to
killing
the
monster
whatever
the
monster
really
was
mike
thought
later
going
home
that
night
that
he
should
have
listened
with
disbelief
mounting
into
horror
and
finally
run
away
as
fast
as
he
could
not
looking
back
convinced
either
that
he
was
being
put
on
by
a
bunch
of
white
kids
who
didn't
like
black
folks
or
that
he
was
in
the
presence
of
six
authentic
lunatics
who
had
in
some
way
caught
their
lunacy
from
each
other
the
way
everyone
in
the
same
class
could
catch
a
particularly
virulent
cold
but
he
didn't
run
because
in
spite
of
the
horror
he
felt
a
strange
sense
of
comfort
comfort
and
something
else
something
more
elemental
a
feeling
of
coming
home
there
are
seven
of
us
here
he
thought
again
as
bill
finally
finished
speaking
he
opened
his
mouth
not
sure
of
what
he
was
going
to
sy
tve
seen
the
clow
he
said
wha
richie
and
stan
asked
together
and
beverly
turned
her
head
so
quickly
that
her
ponytail
flipped
from
her
left
shoulder
to
her
right
saw
him
on
the
fourth
mike
said
slowly
speaking
to
bill
mostly
bill
eyes
sharp
and
utterly
concentrated
were
on
his
demanding
that
he
go
on
yes
on
the
fourth
df
july
he
trailed
off
momentarily
thinking
but
i
knew
him
i
knew
him
because
that
wasn't
the
first
time
i
saw
him
and
it
wasn't
the
first
time
i
saw
something
something
wrong
he
thought
of
the
bird
then
the
first
time
he'd
really
alowed
himself
to
think
of
it
except
in
nightmares
since
may
he
had
thought
he
was
going
crazy
it
was
a
relief
to
find
out
he
wasn't
crazy
but
it
was
still
a
scary
relief
he
wet
his
lips
go
o
bev
said
impatiently
hurry
up
well
the
thing
is
i
was
in
the
parade
i
i
saw
you
eddie
said
you
were
playing
the
saxophone
well
it
actually
a
trombone
mike
said
i
play
with
the
neibolt
church
school
band
anyway
i
saw
the
clown
he
was
handing
out
balloons
to
kids
on
the
threeway
corner
downtown
he
was
just
like
ben
and
bill
said
silver
suit
orange
buttons
white
makeup
on
his
face
big
red
smile
i
don't
know
if
it
was
lipstick
or
makeup
but
it
looked
like
blood
the
others
were
nodding
excited
now
but
bill
only
went
on
looking
at
mike
closely
o
oorange
tufts
of
hhhair
he
asked
mike
making
them
unconsciously
over
his
own
head
with
his
fingers
mike
nodded
seeing
him
like
that
it
scared
me
and
while
i
was
looking
at
him
he
turned
around
and
waved
at
me
like
he'd
read
my
mind
or
my
feelings
or
whatever
you
call
it
and
that
like
scared
me
worse
i
didn't
know
why
then
but
he
scared
me
so
bad
for
a
couple
of
seconds
i
couldn't
play
my
bone
anymore
all
the
spit
in
my
mouth
dried
up
and
i
felt
he
glanced
briefly
at
beverly
he
remembered
it
all
so
clearly
now
how
the
sun
had
suddenly
seemed
intolerably
dazzling
on
the
brass
of
his
horn
and
the
chrome
of
the
cars
the
music
too
loud
the
sky
too
blue
the
clown
had
raised
one
white
gloved
hand
the
other
was
full
of
balloon
strings
and
had
waved
slowly
back
and
forth
his
bloody
grin
too
red
and
too
wide
a
scream
turned
upsidedown
he
remembered
how
the
flesh
of
his
testicles
had
begun
to
crawl
how
his
bowels
had
suddenly
felt
all
loose
and
hot
as
if
he
might
suddenly
drop
a
casual
load
of
shit
into
his
pants
but
he
couldn't
say
any
of
that
in
front
of
beverly
you
didn't
say
stuff
like
that
in
front
of
girls
even
if
they
were
the
sort
of
girls
you
could
say
things
like
bitch
and
bastard
in
front
of.'
i
felt
scared
he
finished
feeling
that
was
too
weak
but
not
knowing
how
to
say
the
rest
but
they
were
nodding
as
if
they
understood
and
he
felt
an
indescribable
relief
wash
through
him
somehow
that
clown
looking
at
him
smiling
his
red
smile
his
white
gloved
hand
penduluming
slowly
back
and
forth
that
had
been
worse
than
having
henry
bowers
and
the
rest
after
him
ever
so
much
worse
then
we
were
past
mike
went
on
we
marched
up
main
street
hill
and
i
saw
him
again
handing
out
balloons
to
kids
except
a
lot
of
them
didn't
want
to
take
them
some
of
the
little
ones
were
crying
i
couldn't
figure
out
how
he
could
have
gotten
up
there
so
fast
i
thought
to
myself
that
there
must
be
two
of
them
you
know
both
of
them
dressed
the
same
way
a
team
but
then
he
turned
around
and
waved
to
me
again
and
i
knew
it
was
him
it
was
the
same
man
he
not
a
man
richie
said
and
beverly
shuddered
bill
put
his
arm
around
her
for
a
moment
and
she
looked
at
him
gratefully
he
waved
to
me
and
then
he
winked
like
we
had
a
secret
or
like
like
maybe
he
knew
i'd
recognized
him
bill
dropped
his
arm
from
beverly
shoulders
you
rehrehrehrecognized
him
think
so
mike
said
i
have
to
check
something
before
i
say
it
for
sure
my
father
got
some
pictures
he
collects
them
listen
you
guys
play
down
here
a
lot
don't
you
sure
ben
said
that
why
we're
building
a
clubhouse
mike
nodded
til
check
and
see
if
i'm
right
if
i
am
i
can
bring
the
pictures
oo
old
pic
pictures
bill
asked
yes
w
w
what
else
bill
asked
mike
opened
his
mouth
and
then
closed
it
again
he
looked
around
at
them
uncertainly
and
then
said
you'd
think
i
was
crazy
crazy
or
lying
ddo
yyyou
ththink
we're
cruhcruhcraz
mike
shook
his
head
you
bet
we're
not
eddie
said
i
got
a
lot
wrong
with
me
but
i'm
not
bughouse
i
don't
think
n
mike
said
i
don't
think
you're
crazy
well
we
we
won't
ththink
you're
cruhcruh
nuts
eeeither
bill
said
mike
looked
them
all
over
cleared
his
throat
and
said
i
saw
a
bird
couple
three
months
ago
i
saw
a
bird
stan
uris
looked
at
mike
what
kind
of
a
bird
speaking
more
reluctantly
than
ever
mike
said
it
looked
like
a
sparrow
sort
of
but
it
also
looked
like
a
robin
it
had
an
orange
chest
well
what
so
special
about
a
bird
ben
asked
there
are
lots
of
birds
in
derry
but
he
felt
uneasy
and
looking
at
stan
he
felt
sure
that
stan
was
remembering
what
had
happened
in
the
standpipe
and
how
he
had
somehow
stopped
it
from
happening
by
shouting
out
the
names
of
birds
but
he
forgot
all
about
that
and
everything
else
when
mike
spoke
again
this
bird
was
bigger
than
a
housetrailer
he
said
he
looked
at
their
shocked
amazed
faces
he
waited
for
their
laughter
but
none
came
stan
looked
as
if
someone
had
clipped
him
with
a
brick
his
face
had
gone
so
pale
it
was
the
color
of
muted
november
sunlight
swear
it
true
mike
said
it
was
a
giant
bird
like
one
of
those
birds
in
the
monster
movies
that
are
supposed
to
be
prehistoric
yeah
like
in
the
giant
cla
richie
said
he
thought
the
bird
in
that
had
been
sort
of
fakelooking
but
by
the
time
it
got
to
new
york
he
had
still
been
excited
enough
to
spill
his
popcom
over
the
balcony
railing
at
the
aladdin
foxy
foxworth
would
have
kicked
him
out
but
the
movie
was
over
by
then
anyway
sometimes
you
got
the
shit
kicked
out
of
you
but
as
big
bill
said
sometimes
you
won
one
too
but
it
didn't
look
prehistoric
mike
said
and
it
didn't
look
like
one
of
those
whatdoyoucallums
the
greeks
and
romans
made
up
stories
about
ruhruh
rocs
bill
suggested
right
i
guess
so
it
wasn't
like
those
either
it
was
just
like
a
combination
robin
and
sparrow
the
two
most
common
birds
you
see
he
laughed
a
little
wildly
w
w
where
bill
began
tell
us
beverly
said
simply
and
after
a
moment
to
collect
his
thoughts
mike
did
and
telling
it
watching
their
faces
grow
concerned
and
scared
but
not
disbelieving
or
derisive
he
felt
an
incredible
weight
lift
from
his
chest
like
ben
with
his
mummy
or
eddie
with
his
leper
and
stan
with
the
drowned
boys
he
had
seen
a
thing
that
would
have
driven
an
adult
insane
not
just
with
terror
but
with
the
walloping
force
of
an
unreality
too
great
to
be
explained
away
or
lacking
any
rational
explanation
simply
ignored
elijah
face
had
been
burned
black
by
the
light
of
god
love
or
so
mike
had
read
but
elijah
had
been
an
old
man
when
it
happened
and
maybe
that
made
a
difference
hadn't
one
of
those
other
bible
fellows
this
one
little
more
than
a
kid
actually
wrestled
an
angel
to
a
draw
he
had
seen
it
and
he
had
gone
on
with
his
life
he
had
integrated
the
memory
into
his
view
of
the
world
he
was
still
young
enough
so
that
view
was
tremendously
wide
but
what
had
happened
that
day
had
nonetheless
haunted
his
mind
darker
corners
and
sometimes
in
his
dreams
he
ran
from
that
grotesque
bird
as
it
printed
its
shadow
on
him
from
above
some
of
these
dreams
he
remembered
and
some
he
did
not
but
they
were
there
shadows
which
moved
by
themselves
how
little
of
it
he
had
forgotten
and
how
greatly
it
had
troubled
him
as
he
went
about
his
daily
round
helping
his
father
going
to
school
riding
his
bike
doing
errands
for
his
mother
waiting
for
the
black
groups
to
come
on
american
bandstand
after
school
was
perhaps
measurable
in
only
one
way
the
relief
he
felt
in
sharing
it
with
the
others
as
he
did
he
realized
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
even
allowed
himself
to
think
of
it
fully
since
that
early
morning
by
the
canal
when
he
had
seen
those
odd
grooves
and
the
blood
mike
told
the
story
of
the
bird
at
the
old
ironworks
and
how
he
had
run
into
the
pipe
to
escape
it
later
on
that
afternoon
three
of
the
losers
ben
richie
bill
walked
toward
the
derry
public
library
ben
and
richie
were
keeping
a
close
watch
for
bowers
and
company
but
bill
only
looked
at
the
sidewalk
frowning
lost
in
thought
about
an
hour
after
telling
them
his
story
mike
had
left
them
saying
his
father
wanted
him
home
by
four
to
pick
peas
beverly
had
to
do
some
marketing
and
fix
dinner
for
her
father
she
said
both
eddie
and
stan
had
their
own
things
to
do
but
before
they
broke
up
for
the
day
they
began
digging
what
was
to
become
if
ben
was
right
their
underground
clubhouse
to
bill
and
to
all
of
them
he
suspected
the
groundbreaking
had
seemed
an
almost
symbolic
act
they
had
begun
whatever
it
was
they
were
supposed
to
do
as
a
group
as
a
unit
they
had
begun
ben
asked
bill
if
he
believed
like
hanlon
story
they
were
passing
derry
community
house
and
the
library
was
just
ahead
a
stone
oblong
comfortably
shaded
by
elms
a
century
old
and
as
yet
untouched
by
the
dutch
elm
disease
that
would
later
plague
and
thin
them
yeah
bill
said
i
ththink
it
was
the
truhhooth
gccrazy
but
true
what
about
you
rub
ruh
richie
richie
nodded
yeah
i
hate
to
believe
it
if
you
know
what
i
mean
but
i
guess
i
do
you
remember
what
he
said
about
the
bird
tongue
bill
and
ben
nodded
orange
fluffs
on
it
that
the
kicker
richie
said
it
like
some
comicbook
villain
lex
luthor
or
the
joker
or
someone
like
that
it
always
leaves
a
trademark
bill
nodded
thoughtfully
it
was
like
some
comicbook
villain
because
they
saw
it
that
way
thought
of
it
that
way
yes
perhaps
so
it
was
kid
stuff
but
it
seemed
that
was
what
this
thing
thrived
on
kid
stuff
they
crossed
the
street
to
the
library
side
aaasked
stuhstuhstan
tif
he
eever
bhheard
of
a
buhbird
[like
that
bill
said
nuhnuh
not
mnecessarily
a
bbbig
wuhwuhone
but
j
just
aaa
a
real
one
richie
suggested
bill
nodded
hhe
suhsaid
there
nammight
be
a
buhbird
like
that
in
suhhouth
america
or
aaaafrica
but
nuhnuhnot
aaround
hi+
here
he
didn't
believe
it
then
ben
asked
hhhe
buhbelieved
ii
it
bill
said
and
then
he
told
them
something
else
stan
had
suggested
when
bill
walked
with
him
back
to
where
stan
had
left
his
bike
stan
idea
was
that
nobody
else
could
have
seen
that
bird
before
mike
told
them
that
story
something
else
maybe
but
not
that
bird
because
the
bird
was
mike
hanlon
personal
monster
but
now
why
now
that
bird
was
the
property
of
the
whole
losers
club
wasn't
it
any
of
them
might
see
it
it
might
not
look
exactly
the
same
bill
might
see
it
as
a
crow
richie
as
a
hawk
beverly
as
a
golden
eagle
for
all
stan
knew
but
it
could
be
a
bird
to
all
of
them
now
bill
told
stan
that
if
that
was
true
then
any
of
them
might
see
the
leper
the
mummy
or
possibly
the
dead
boys
which
means
we
ought
to
do
something
pretty
soon
if
we're
going
to
do
anything
at
all
stan
had
replied
it
knows
wuh
what
bill
had
asked
sharply
eheverything
we
nub
know
man
if
it
knows
that
we're
sunk
stan
had
answered
but
you
can
bet
it
knows
we
know
about
/f
i
think
it'll
try
to
get
us
are
you
still
thinking
about
what
we
talked
about
yesterday
yes
i
wish
i
could
go
with
you
buhbuhben
and
rihrichie
wwwill
ben
really
sssmart
and
rihrihrichie
is
too
when
he
ihisn't
fucking
o
off
now
standing
outside
the
library
richie
asked
bill
exactly
what
it
was
he
had
in
mind
bill
told
them
speaking
slowly
so
he
wouldn't
stutter
too
badly
the
idea
had
been
circling
in
his
mind
for
the
last
two
weeks
but
it
had
taken
mike
story
of
the
bird
to
crystallize
it
what
did
you
do
if
you
wanted
to
get
rid
of
a
bird
well
shooting
it
was
pretty
goddam
final
what
did
you
do
if
you
wanted
to
get
rid
of
a
monster
well
the
movies
suggested
that
shooting
it
with
a
silver
bullet
was
pretty
goddam
final
ben
and
richie
listened
to
this
respectfully
enough
then
richie
asked
how
do
you
get
a
silver
bullet
big
bill
send
away
for
it
very
fuhfuhfunny
we'll
have
to
mmmake
it
ho
i
guess
that
what
we're
at
the
library
to
find
out
ben
said
richie
nodded
and
pushed
his
glasses
up
on
his
nose
behind
them
his
eyes
were
sharp
and
thoughtful
but
doubtful
bill
thought
he
felt
doubtful
himself
at
least
there
was
no
foolishness
in
rchie
eyes
and
that
was
a
step
in
the
right
direction
you
thinking
about
your
dad
walther
richie
asked
the
one
we
took
to
neibolt
street
ye
bill
said
even
if
we
could
really
make
silver
bullets
richie
said
where
would
we
get
the
silver
let
me
worry
about
that
ben
said
quietly
well
okay
richie
said
we'll
let
haystack
worry
about
that
then
what
neibolt
street
again
bill
nodded
neeneeneibolt
street
aaagain
and
then
we
buhblow
its
fucking
hh
head
o
off
the
three
of
them
stood
there
a
moment
longer
looking
at
each
other
solemnly
and
then
they
went
into
the
library
sure
an
begorrah
it
that
black
feller
again
richie
cried
in
his
irish
cop
voice
a
week
had
passed
it
was
nearly
mid
july
and
the
underground
clubhouse
was
almost
finished
top
o
the
mornin
to
ye
mr
o'hanlon
sor
and
a
foine
foine
day
it
promises
to
be
foine
as
pertaters
a
growin
as
me
old
mither
used
to
so
far
as
i
know
noon
is
the
top
of
the
morning
richie
ben
said
popping
up
in
the
hole
and
noon
was
two
hours
ago
he
and
richie
had
been
putting
in
shoring
around
the
sides
of
the
hole
ben
had
taken
off
his
sweatshirt
because
the
day
was
hot
and
the
work
was
hard
his
tee
shit
was
gray
with
sweat
and
stuck
to
his
chest
and
pouch
of
a
stomach
he
seemed
remarkably
unselfconscious
of
the
way
he
looked
but
mike
guessed
that
if
ben
heard
beverly
coming
he
would
be
inside
that
baggy
sweatshirt
again
before
you
could
say
puppy
love
don't
be
so
picky
you
sound
like
stan
the
man
richie
said
he
had
gotten
out
of
the
hole
five
minutes
before
because
he
told
ben
it
was
time
for
a
cigarette
break
i
thought
you
said
you
didn't
have
any
cigarettes
ben
had
said
i
don't
richie
had
replied
but
the
principle
remains
the
same
mike
had
his
father
photograph
album
under
his
arm
where
is
everybody
he
asked
he
knew
bill
had
to
be
somewhere
around
because
he
had
left
his
own
bike
parked
under
the
bridge
near
silver
bill
and
eddie
went
down
to
the
dump
about
half
an
hour
ago
to
liberate
some
more
boards
richie
said
stanny
and
bev
went
down
to
reynolds
hardware
to
get
hinges
i
don't
know
what
the
frock
haystack
up
to
down
there
up
to
down
there
haha
you
get
it
but
it
probably
no
good
boy
needs
someone
to
keep
an
eye
on
him
you
know
by
the
way
you
owe
us
twentythree
cents
if
you
still
want
to
be
in
this
club
your
share
of
the
hinges
mike
switched
the
album
from
his
right
arm
to
his
left
and
dug
into
his
pocket
he
counted
out
twentythree
cents
leaving
a
grand
total
of
one
dime
in
his
own
personal
treasury
and
handed
it
over
to
richie
then
he
walked
over
to
the
hole
and
looked
in
except
it
really
wasn't
a
hole
anymore
the
sides
had
been
neatly
squared
off
each
side
had
been
shored
up
the
boards
were
all
mongrels
but
ben
bill
and
stan
had
done
a
good
job
of
sizing
them
with
tools
from
zack
denbrough
shop
and
bill
had
been
at
great
pains
to
make
sure
every
tool
was
returned
every
night
and
in
the
same
condition
as
when
it
was
taken
ben
and
beverly
had
nailed
crosspieces
between
the
supports
the
hole
still
made
eddie
a
little
nervous
but
that
was
eddie
nature
piled
carefully
to
one
side
were
squares
of
sod
which
would
later
be
glued
to
the
top
i
think
you
guys
know
what
you're
doing
mike
said
sure
ben
said
and
pointed
to
the
album
what
you
got
my
father
derry
album
mike
said
he
collects
old
pictures
and
clippings
about
the
town
it
his
hobby
i
was
looking
through
it
a
couple
of
days
ago
i
told
you
i
thought
i'd
seen
that
clown
before
and
i
did
in
here
so
i
brought
it
down
he
was
too
ashamed
to
add
that
he
had
not
dared
to
ask
his
father
permission
to
do
this
afraid
of
the
questions
to
which
such
a
request
might
lead
he
had
taken
it
from
the
house
like
a
thief
while
his
father
planted
potatoes
in
the
west
field
and
his
mother
hung
clothes
in
the
back
yard
i
thought
you
guys
ought
to
take
a
look
too
well
let
see
richie
said
td
like
to
wait
until
everybody
here
it
might
be
better
okay
richie
was
in
truth
not
that
anxious
to
look
at
more
pictures
of
derry
in
this
or
any
other
album
not
after
what
had
happened
in
georgie
room
you
want
to
help
me
and
ben
with
the
rest
of
the
shoring
you
bet
mike
put
his
father
album
down
carefully
far
enough
from
the
hole
so
it
wouldn't
be
pelted
with
flying
dirt
and
took
ben
shovel
dig
right
here
ben
said
showing
mike
the
spot
go
down
about
a
foot
then
i'll
set
a
board
in
and
hold
it
flush
against
the
side
while
you
shovel
the
dirt
back
in
good
plan
ma
richie
said
sagely
from
where
he
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
excavation
with
his
sneakers
dangling
down
what
wrong
with
you
mike
asked
got
a
bone
in
my
leg
richie
said
comfortably
how
your
project
with
bill
going
mike
stopped
long
enough
to
strip
off
his
shirt
and
then
began
to
dig
it
was
hot
down
here
even
in
the
barrens
crickets
hummed
sleepily
like
summer
clocks
in
the
brush
well
not
too
bad
richie
said
and
mike
thought
he
flashed
ben
a
mildly
warning
look
i
guess
why
don't
you
play
your
radio
richie
ben
asked
he
slipped
a
board
into
the
hole
mike
had
dug
and
held
it
there
richie
transistor
was
hung
by
the
strap
in
its
accustomed
place
on
the
thick
branch
of
a
nearby
shrub
batteries
are
worn
out
richie
said
you
had
to
have
my
last
twentyfive
cents
for
hinges
remember
cruel
haystack
very
cruel
after
all
the
things
i've
done
for
you

all
i

mcghee
they
were
looking
at
him
with
such
amazement
that
mike
laughed
you
lost
me
after
little
richard
richie
said
he
liked
little
richard
but
if
he
had
a
secret
rockandroll
hero
that
summer
it
was
jerry
lee
lewis
his
mom
had
happened
to
come
into
the
living
room
while
jerry
lee
was
performing
on
american
bandstand
this
was
at
the
point
in
his
act
where
jerry
lee
actually
climbed
onto
his
piano
and
played
it
upside
down
with
his
hair
hanging
in
his
face
he
had
been
singing
high
school
confidential
for
a
moment
richie
believed
his
mom
was
going
to
faint
she
didn't
but
she
was
so
traumatized
by
what
she
had
seen
that
she
talked
at
dinner
that
night
about
sending
richie
to
one
of
those
militarytype
camps
for
the
rest
of
the
summer
now
richie
shook
his
hair
down
over
his
eyes
and
began
to
sing
come
on
over
baby
all
the
cats
are
at
the
high
school
rockin
ben
began
to
stagger
around
the
hole
grasping
his
large
belly
and
pretending
to
puke
mike
held
his
nose
but
he
was
laughing
so
hard
tears
squirted
out
of
his
eyes
what
wrong
richie
demanded
i
mean
what
ails
you
guys
that
was
good
i
mean
that
was
really
good”
oh

mike
said
and
now
he
was
laughing
so
hard
he
could
barely
talk
that
was
priceless
i
mean
that
was
really
priceless
negroes
have
no
taste
richie
said
i
think
it
even
says
so
in
the
bible
yo
mamma
mike
said
laughing
harder
than
ever
when
richie
asked
with
honest
bewilderment
what
that
meant
mike
sat
down
with
a
thump
and
rocked
back
and
forth
howling
and
holding
his
stomach
you
probably
think
i'm
jealous
richie
said
you
probably
think
i
want
to
be
a
negro
now
ben
also
fell
down
laughing
wildly
his
whole
body
rippled
and
quaked
alarmingly
his
eyes
bulged
no
more
richie
he
managed
tm
gonna
shit

dddie

pawnshop
and
ell
people
switchblades
and
plastic
dog
puke
and
used
guitars
ben
and
mike
were
now
actually
screaming
with
laughter
their
laughter
echoed
through
the
green
and
jungly
ravine
that
was
the
misnamed
barrens
causing
birds
to
take
wing
and
squirrels
to
freeze
momentarily
on
limbs
it
was
a
young
sound
penetrating
lively
vital
unsophisticated
free
almost
every
living
thing
within
range
of
that
sound
reacted
to
it
in
some
way
but
the
thing
which
had
tumbled
out
of
a
wide
concrete
drain
and
into
the
upper
kenduskeag
was
not
living
the
previous
afternoon
there
had
been
a
sudden
driving
thunderstorm
the
clubhousetobe
had
not
been
much
affected
since
digging
operations
had
begun
ben
had
covered
the
hole
carefully
each
evening
with
a
ragged
piece
of
tarpaulin
eddie
had
scrounged
from
behind
wally
spa
it
smelled
painty
but
it
did
the
job
and
the
stormdrains
under
derry
had
run
with
violent
water
for
two
or
three
hours
it
was
that
spate
of
water
that
had
pushed
this
unpleasant
baggage
into
the
sun
for
the
flies
to
find
it
was
the
body
of
a
nineyear
old
named
jimmy
cullum
except
for
the
nose
his
face
was
gone
there
was
a
churned
and
featureless
mess
where
it
had
been
this
raw
meat
was
dotted
with
deep
black
marks
that
perhaps
only
stan
uris
would
have
recognized
for
what
they
were
pecks
pecks
made
by
a
very
large
beak
water
rilled
over
jimmy
cullum
muddy
chino
pants
his
white
hands
floated
like
dead
fish
they
had
also
been
pecked
although
not
as
badly
his
paisley
shirt
ballooned
out
and
collapsed
back
ballooned
out
and
collapsed
back
like
a
bladder
bill
and
eddie
loaded
down
with
boards
scrounged
from
the
dump
crossed
the
kenduskeag
by
steppingstones
less
than
forty
yards
from
the
body
they
heard
richie
ben
and
mike
laughing
smiled
a
little
themselves
and
hurried
past
the
unseen
ruin
of
jimmy
cullum
to
see
what
was
so
funny
they
were
still
laughing
as
bill
and
eddie
came
into
the
clearing
sweating
under
their
load
of
lumber
even
eddie
usually
as
pale
as
cheese
had
some
color
in
his
face
they
dropped
the
new
boards
on
the
almost
depleted
supplypile
ben
climbed
out
of
the
hole
to
inspect
them
good
deal
he
said
wow
great
bill
collapsed
to
the
ground

i
khave
my
heart
aaattack

or

have
to
wub

he
had
brought
a
few
tools
of
his
own
down
to
the
barrens
and
was
now
going
over
the
new
boards
carefully
pounding
out
nails
and
removing
screws
he
tossed
one
aside
because
it
was
splintered
rapping
on
another
returned
a
dull
punky
sound
in
at
least
three
places
and
he
also
tossed
that
one
aside
eddie
sat
on
a
pile
of
dirt
watching
him
he
took
a
honk
on
his
aspirator
as
ben
pulled
a
rusty
nail
from
a
board
with
the
claw
end
of
his
hammer
the
nail
squealed
like
some
small
unpleasant
animal
that
had
been
stepped
on
and
didn't
like
it
you
can
get
tetanus
if
you
cut
yourself
on
a
rusty
nail
eddie
informed
ben
yea
richie
said
what
titnuss
sounds
like
a
woman
disease
you're
a
bird
eddie
said
it
tetanus
not
titnuss
and
it
means
lock
jaw
there
these
special
microbes
that
grow
in
rust
see
and
if
you
cut
yourself
they
can
get
inside
your
body
and
um
fuck
up
your
nerves
eddie
wert
an
even
darker
red
and
took
another
fast
honk
on
his
aspirator
lock
jaw
jesu
richie
said
impressed
that
sounds
mean
you
bet
first
your
jaw
locks
up
so
tight
you
can't
open
your
mouth
not
even
to
eat
they
have
to
cut
a
hole
in
your
cheek
and
feed
you
liquids
through
a
tube
oh
man
mike
said
standing
up
in
the
hole
his
eyes
were
wide
the
corneas
very
white
in
his
brown
face
for
sure
my
mom
told
me
eddie
said
then
your
throat
locks
up
and
you
can't
eat
anymore
ad
you
starve
to
death
they
contemplated
this
horror
in
silence
there
no
cur
eddie
amplified
more
silence
so
eddie
said
briskly
i
always
watch
out
for
rusty
nails
and
shit
like
that
i
had
to
have
a
tetanus
shot
once
and
it
really
hurt
so
why'd
you
go
to
the
dump
with
bill
and
bring
all
this
crap
back
richie
asked
eddie
glanced
briefly
at
bill
who
was
looking
into
the
clubhouse
and
there
was
all
the
love
and
heroworship
in
that
gaze
needed
to
answer
such
a
question
but
eddie
said
softly
some
stuff
has
to
be
done
even
if
there
is
a
risk
that
the
first
important
thing
i
ever
found
out
i
didn't
find
out
from
my
mother
a
further
silence
not
quite
uncomfortable
followed
then
ben
went
back
to
pounding
out
rusty
nails
and
after
awhile
mike
hanlon
joined
him
richie
transistor
robbed
of
its
voice
at
least
until
richie
allowance
came
in
or
he
found
a
lawn
to
mow
swung
from
its
low
branch
in
a
mild
breeze
bill
had
time
to
reflect
upon
how
odd
all
this
was
how
odd
and
how
perfect
that
they
should
all
be
here
this
summer
there
were
kids
he
knew
visiting
relatives
kids
he
knew
who
were
off
on
vacations
at
disney
land
in
california
or
on
cape
cod
or
in
the
case
of
one
chum
an
unimaginably
distantsounding
place
with
the
queer
but
somehow
evocative
name
of
gstaad
there
were
kids
at
church
camp
kids
at
scout
camp
kids
at
rich
kid
camps
where
you
could
learn
to
swim
and
play
golf
camps
where
you
learned
to
say
hey
good
one
instead
of
fuck
you
when
your
opponent
got
a
killer
serve
past
you
at
tennis
kids
whose
parents
had
simply
taken
them
away
bill
could
understand
that
he
knew
some
kids
who
wanted
to
go
away
frightened
by
the
boogeyman
stalking
derry
this
summer
but
suspected
there
were
more
parents
frightened
by
that
boogeyman
people
who
had
planned
to
take
their
vacations
at
home
suddenly
decided
to
go
away
gstaad
was
that
in
sweden
argentina
spain
instead
it
was
a
little
like
the
polio
scare
of
when
four
kids
who
went
swimming
in
the
o'brian
memorial
pool
had
gotten
the
disease
grownups
word
absolutely
synonymous
in
bill
mind
with
mothers
and
fathers
had
decided
then
as
now
that
away
was
better
safer
anyone
able
to
clear
out
had
cleared
bill
understood
away
and
he
could
muse
over
a
word
of
such
fabulous
wonder
as
gstaad
but
wonder
was
cold
comfort
compared
with
desire
gstaad
was
away
derry
was
desire
and
none
of
us
have
gone
away
he
thought
watching
as
ben
and
mike
pounded
used
nails
out
of
used
boards
as
eddie
strolled
off
into
the
bushes
to
take
a
whiz
you
had
to
go
as
soon
as
you
could
in
order
to
avoid
seriously
straining
your
bladder
he
told
bill
once
but
you
also
had
to
watch
out
for
poison
ivy
because
who
needed
a
case
of
that
on
your
pecker
we're
all
here
in
derry
no
camp
no
relatives
no
vacations
no
away
all
right
here
present
and
accounted
for
there
a
door
down
ther
eddie
said
zipping
his
fly
as
he
came
back
hope
you
shook
off
eds
richie
said
if
you
don't
shake
off
each
time
you
can
get
cancer
my
mom
told
me
so
eddie
looked
startled
thinly
worried
and
then
saw
richie
grin
he
withered
him
or
tried
to
with
a
babiesmustplay
look
and
then
said
it
was
too
big
for
us
to
carry
but
bill
said
if
all
of
us
went
down
we
could
get
it
up
here
of
course
you
can
never
shake
off
completely
richie
went
on
you
want
to
know
what
a
wise
man
once
told
me
eds
n
eddie
said
and
i
don't
want
you
to
call
me
eds
anymore
richie
i
mean
i'm
sincere
i
don't
call
you
dick
as
in
you
got
any
gum
on
ya
dick
so
i
don't
see
why
this
wise
man
richie
said
told
me
this
no
matter
how
much
you
squirm
and
dance
the
last
two
drops
go
in
your
pants
and
that
why
there
so
much
cancer
in
the
world
eddie
my
love
the
reason
there
so
much
cancer
in
the
world
is
because
nerds
like
you
and
beverly
marsh
smoke
cigarettes
eddie
said
beverly
is
not
a
nerd
ben
said
in
a
forbidding
voice
you
just
watch
what
you
say
trashmouth
beepbeep
you
gguys
bill
said
absently
and
speaking
of
bbbeverly
she
pretty
struhstruhstrong
she
could
hhhelp
get
that
duhdoor
ben
asked
what
kind
of
door
it
was
muhmuh
hogany
i
thhink
somebody
threw
out
a
mahogany
door
ben
asked
surprised
but
not
unbelieving
people
throw
out
everything
mike
said
that
dump
it
kills
me
to
go
down
there
i
mean
it
kills
me
yeah
ben
agreed
a
lot
of
that
stuff
could
be
fixed
up
easy
and
there
are
people
in
china
and
south
america
with
nothing
that
what
my
mother
says
there
people
with
nothing
right
here
in
maine
sunny
ji
richie
said
grimly
wwwhat
ththis
bill
asked
noticing
the
album
mike
had
brought
mike
told
him
saying
he
would
show
them
the
picture
of
the
clown
when
stan
and
beverly
got
back
with
the
hinges
bill
and
richie
exchanged
a
look
what
wrong
mike
asked
is
it
what
happened
in
your
brother
room
bill
yyea
bill
said
and
would
say
no
more
they
took
turns
working
on
the
hole
until
stan
and
beverly
came
back
each
with
a
brown
paper
bag
containing
hinges
as
mike
talked
ben
sat
crosslegged
tailorfashion
and
made
glassless
windows
that
would
swing
open
and
shut
in
two
of
the
long
boards
perhaps
only
bill
noticed
how
quickly
and
easily
his
fingers
moved
how
adept
and
knowing
they
were
like
surgeon
fingers
bill
admired
that
some
of
these
pictures
go
back
a
hundred
years
my
dad
said
mike
told
them
holding
the
album
on
his
lap
he
gets
them
at
those
sales
people
have
in
their
yards
and
at
secondhand
shops
sometimes
he
buys
them
or
trades
other
collectors
for
them
some
of
them
are
stereoscopes
there
two
of
them
just
the
same
on
a
long
card
md
when
you
look
at
them
through
this
thing
like
binoculars
it
looks
like
one
picture
only
in
d
like
house
of
wax
or
the
creature
from
the
black
lagoon
why
does
he
like
all
that
stuff
beverly
asked
she
was
wearing
ordinary
levi
but
she
had
done
something
amusing
to
the
cuffs
blousing
them
out
with
a
bright
paisley
material
for
the
final
four
inches
so
that
they
looked
like
pants
out
of
some
sailor
whimsy
yea
eddie
said
most
of
the
time
derry
pretty
boring
well
i
don't
know
for
sure
but
i
think
it
because
he
wasn't
born
here
mike
said
diffidently
it
like
i
don't
know
like
it
all
new
to
him
or
like
you
know
if
you
came
in
during
the
middle
of
a
movie
shshsure
you'd
want
to
see
the
sstar
bill
said
yeah
mike
said
there
a
lot
of
history
lying
around
in
derry
i
kind
of
like
it
and
i
think
some
of
it
has
to
do
with
this
thing
this
it
if
you
want
to
call
it
that
he
looked
at
bill
and
bill
nodded
his
eyes
thoughtful
so
i
was
looking
through
it
after
the
fourth
of
july
parade
because
i
knew
i'd
seen
that
clown
before
i
knew
it
and
look
he
opened
the
book
thumbed
through
it
then
handed
it
to
ben
who
was
sitting
on
his
right
dddon't
tttouch
the
puhpuhpages
bill
said
and
there
was
such
urgency
in
his
voice
that
they
all
jumped
he
had
fisted
the
hand
he
had
cut
reaching
into
georgie
album
richie
saw
fisted
it
into
a
tight
protective
knot
bill
right
richie
said
and
that
subdued
totally
unrichielike
voice
was
a
powerful
convincer
be
careful
it
like
stan
said
if
we
saw
it
happen
you
guys
could
see
it
happen
too
feel
it
bill
added
grimly
the
album
went
from
hand
to
hand
each
of
them
holding
the
book
gingerly
by
the
edges
as
if
it
were
old
dynamite
sweating
big
beads
of
nitro
it
came
back
to
mike
he
opened
it
to
one
of
the
first
pages
daddy
says
there
no
way
to
date
that
one
but
it
probably
from
the
early
or
mid
seventeerhundred
mike
said
he
repaired
a
guy
handsaw
for
a
box
of
old
books
and
pictures
that
was
one
of
them
he
says
it
might
be
worth
forty
bucks
or
even
more
the
picture
was
a
woodcut
the
size
of
a
large
postcard
when
bill
turn
came
to
look
at
it
he
was
relieved
to
see
that
mike
father
had
the
land
of
album
where
the
pictures
were
under
a
protective
plastic
sheet
he
looked
fascinated
and
he
thought
there
i'm
seeing
him
or
it
really
seeing
that
the
face
of
the
enemy
the
picture
showed
a
funny
felow
juggling
oversized
bowling
pins
in
the
middle
of
a
muddy
street
there
were
a
few
houses
on
either
side
of
the
street
and
a
few
huts
that
bill
guessed
were
stores
or
trading
posts
or
whatever
they
called
them
back
then
it
didn't
look
like
derry
at
all
except
for
the
canal
it
was
there
neatly
cobbled
on
both
sides
in
the
upper
background
bill
could
see
a
team
of
mules
on
a
towpath
dragging
a
barge
there
was
a
group
of
maybe
half
a
dozen
kids
gathered
around
the
funny
fellow
one
of
them
was
wearing
a
pastoral
straw
hat
another
had
a
hoop
and
a
stick
to
roll
it
with
not
the
sort
of
stick
that
would
come
with
a
hoop
that
you
bought
today
in
a
woolworth
it
was
a
branch
from
a
tree
bill
could
see
the
bare
knobs
on
it
where
smaller
branches
had
been
lopped
off
with
a
knife
or
a
hatchet
that
baby
wasn't
made
in
taiwan
or
korea
he
thought
fascinated
by
this
boy
who
could
have
been
him
if
he'd
been
born
four
or
five
generations
before
the
funny
fellow
had
a
huge
grin
on
his
face
he
wore
no
makeup
except
to
bill
his
whole
face
looked
like
makeup
but
he
was
bald
except
for
two
tufts
of
hair
that
stuck
up
like
horns
over
his
ears
and
bill
had
no
trouble
recognizing
their
clown
two
hundred
years
ago
or
more
he
thought
and
felt
a
crazy
surge
of
terror
anger
and
excitement
rush
through
him
twentyseven
years
later
sitting
in
the
derry
public
library
and
remembering
his
first
look
into
mike
father
album
he
realized
he
had
felt
the
way
a
hunter
might
feel
coming
upon
the
first
fresh
spoor
of
an
old
killer
tiger
two
hundred
years
ago
that
long
and
only
god
knows
how
much
longer
this
led
him
to
wonder
just
how
long
the
spirit
of
pennywise
had
been
here
in
derry
but
he
found
that
was
a
thought
he
did
not
really
want
to
pursue
gimme
bill
richie
was
saying
but
bill
held
the
album
a
moment
longer
staring
fixedly
at
the
woodcut
sure
it
would
begin
to
move
the
bowling
pins
if
that
what
they
were
which
the
funny
fellow
was
juggling
would
rise
and
fall
rise
and
fall
the
kids
would
laugh
and
applaud
except
maybe
they
wouldn't
all
laugh
and
applaud
some
of
them
might
scream
and
run
instead
the
muleteam
pulling
the
barge
would
move
beyond
the
borders
of
the
picture
it
didn't
happen
and
he
passed
the
book
on
to
richie
when
the
album
came
back
to
mike
he
turned
some
more
pages
hunting
here
he
said
this
one
is
from
four
years
before
lincoln
was
elected
president
the
book
went
around
again
this
was
a
color
picture
a
sort
of
cartoon
which
showed
a
bunch
of
drunks
standing
in
front
of
a
saloon
while
a
fat
politician
with
muttonchop
whiskers
declaimed
from
a
board
that
had
been
set
between
two
hogsheads
he
held
a
foamy
pitcher
of
beer
in
one
hand
the
board
upon
which
he
stood
was
considerably
bowed
with
his
weight
some
distance
off
a
group
of
bonneted
women
were
looking
at
this
show
of
mingled
buffoonery
and
intemperance
with
disgust
the
caption
below
the
picture
read
politics
is
thirsty
work
sez
senator
garner
daddy
says
pictures
like
this
were
really
popular
for
about
twenty
years
before
the
civil
war
mike
said
they
called
them
foolcards
and
people
used
to
send
them
to
each
other
they
were
like
some
of
the
jokes
in
mad
i
guess
suh
subh
satire
bill
said
yea
mike
said
but
now
look
down
in
the
corner
of
this
one
the
picture
was
like
mad
in
another
way
it
had
as
many
details
and
little
sidejokes
as
a
big
mort
drucker
panel
in
a
mad
magazine
movie
takeoff
there
was
a
grinning
fat
man
pouring
a
glass
of
beer
down
a
spotted
dog
throat
there
was
a
woman
who
had
fallen
on
her
prat
in
a
mudpuddle
there
were
two
street
urchins
slyly
sticking
sulphurheaded
matches
into
the
soles
of
a
prosperouslooking
businessman
shoes
and
a
girl
swinging
from
her
heels
in
an
elm
tree
so
that
her
underpants
showed
but
despite
this
bewildering
intaglio
of
detail
none
of
them
really
needed
mike
to
point
the
clown
out
dressed
in
a
loud
checked
vestbusting
drummer
suit
he
was
playing
the
shell
game
with
a
bunch
of
drunken
loggers
he
was
winking
at
a
lumber
jack
who
had
to
judge
by
the
gapemouthed
look
of
surprise
on
his
face
just
picked
the
wrong
nutshell
the
drummer/clown
was
taking
a
coin
from
him
him
again
ben
said
what
a
hundred
years
later
just
about
mike
said
and
here
one
from
it
was
a
clipping
from
the
front
page
of
the
derry
news
huzzah
the
headline
proclaimed
exuberantly
ironworks
opens
just
below
this
town
turns
out
for
gala
picnic
the
picture
showed
a
woodcut
of
the
ribboncutting
ceremony
at
the
kitchener
ironworks
its
style
reminded
bill
of
the
currier
and
ives
prints
his
mother
had
in
the
dining
room
although
this
was
nowhere
near
as
polished
a
fellow
tricked
out
in
a
morning
coat
and
tophat
was
holding
a
large
pair
of
openjawed
scissors
above
the
ironworks
ribbon
while
a
crowd
of
perhaps
five
hundred
watched
off
to
the
left
was
a
clown
their
clown
tuming
a
handspring
for
a
group
of
children
the
artist
had
caught
him
upside
down
turning
his
smile
into
a
scream
he
passed
the
book
on
quickly
to
richie
the
next
picture
was
a
photograph
under
which
will
hanlon
had
written
repeal
in
derry
although
none
of
the
boys
knew
much
about
either
the
volstead
act
or
its
repeal
the
picture
made
the
salient
facts
clear
the
photo
was
of
wally
spa
down
in
hell
half
acre
the
place
was
almost
literally
filled
to
the
rafters
with
men
wearing
opencollared
white
shirts
straw
boaters
lumbermen
shirts
teeshirts
banker
suits
all
of
them
were
holding
glasses
and
bottles
victoriously
aloft
there
were
two
big
signs
in
the
window
welcome
back
john
barleycorn
one
read
the
other
said
free
beer
tonight
the
clown
dressed
like
the
biggest
dandy
you
ever
saw
white
shoes
spats
gangster
pants
had
his
foot
on
the
running
board
of
a
reo
auto
and
was
drinking
champagne
from
a
lady
highheeled
shoe
mike
said
the
derry
news
again
the
headline
japan
surrenders
it
over
thank
god
it
over
a
parade
was
snakedancing
its
way
along
main
street
toward
upmile
hill
and
there
was
the
clown
in
the
background
wearing
his
silver
suit
with
the
orange
buttons
frozen
in
the
matrix
of
dots
that
made
up
the
grainy
newsprint
photo
seeming
to
suggest
at
least
to
bill
that
nothing
was
over
no
one
had
surrendered
nothing
was
won
nil
was
still
the
rule
zilch
still
the
custom
seeming
to
suggest
above
all
that
all
was
still
lost
bill
felt
cold
and
dry
and
scared
suddenly
the
dots
in
the
picture
disappeared
and
it
began
to
move
that
what
mike
began
llloo
bill
said
the
word
dropped
out
of
his
mouth
like
a
partially
melted
icecube
aa
all
of
you
luhlook
at
ththi
they
crowded
around
oh
my
god
beverly
whispered
awed
that
it
richie
nearly
screamed
pounding
bill
on
the
back
in
his
excitement
he
looked
around
at
eddie
white
drawn
face
and
stan
uris
frozen
one
that
what
we
saw
in
george
room
that
exactly
what
we
shhh
ben
said
listen
and
almost
sobbing
you
can
hear
them
christ
you
can
hear
them
in
there
and
in
the
silence
that
was
only
broken
by
the
mild
stir
of
the
summer
breeze
they
all
realized
they
could
the
band
was
playing
a
martial
marching
tune
made
faint
and
tinny
by
distance
or
the
passage
of
time
or
whatever
it
was
the
cheering
of
the
crowd
was
like
sounds
that
might
come
through
on
a
badly
tuned
radio
station
there
were
popping
noises
also
faint
like
the
muffled
sound
of
snapping
fingers
firecrackers
beverly
whispered
and
rubbed
at
her
eyes
with
hands
that
shook
those
are
firecrackers
aren't
they
no
one
answered
they
watched
the
picture
their
eyes
eating
up
their
faces
the
parade
wiggled
its
way
toward
them
but
just
lefore
the
marchers
reached
the
extreme
foreground
at
the
point
where
it
seemed
they
must
march
right
out
of
the
picture
and
into
a
world
thirteen
years
later
they
dropped
from
sight
as
if
on
some
kind
of
unknowable
curve
the
world
war
i
soldiers
first
their
faces
strangely
old
under
their
pieplate
helmets
with
their
sign
which
read
the
derry
vfw
welcomes
home
our
brave
boys
then
the
boy
scouts
the
kiwanians
the
home
nursing
corps
the
derry
christian
marching
band
then
the
derry
world
war
ii
vets
themselves
with
the
highschool
band
behind
them
the
crowd
moved
and
shifted
tickertape
and
confetti
fluttered
down
from
the
second
and
_thirdfloor
windows
of
the
business
buildings
that
lined
the
streets
the
clown
pranced
along
the
sidelines
doing
splits
and
cartwheels
miming
a
sniper
miming
a
salute
and
bill
noticed
for
the
first
time
that
people
were
turning
from
him
but
not
as
if
they
saw
him
exactly
it
was
more
as
if
they
felt
a
draft
or
smelled
something
bad
only
the
children
really
saw
him
and
they
shrank
away
ben
stretched
his
hand
out
to
the
picture
as
bill
had
done
in
george
room
nuhnuhnuhno
bill
cried
i
think
it
all
right
bill
ben
said
look
and
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
protective
plastic
over
the
picture
for
a
moment
and
then
took
it
back
but
if
you
stripped
off
that
cover
beverly
screamed
the
clown
had
left
off
its
antics
when
ben
withdrew
his
hand
it
rushed
toward
them
its
paintbloody
mouth
gibbering
and
laughing
bill
winced
back
but
held
onto
the
book
all
the
same
thinking
it
would
drop
out
of
sight
as
the
parade
had
done
and
the
marching
band
and
the
boy
scouts
and
the
cadillac
convertible
carrying
miss
derry
of
but
the
clown
did
not
disappear
along
that
curve
that
seemed
to
define
the
edge
of
that
old
existence
instead
it
leaped
with
a
scary
nimble
grace
onto
a
lamppost
that
stood
in
the
extreme
left
foreground
of
the
picture
it
shinnied
up
like
a
monkey
on
a
stick
and
suddenly
its
face
was
pressed
against
the
tough
plastic
sheet
will
hanlon
had
put
over
each
of
the
pages
in
his
book
beverly
screamed
again
and
this
time
eddie
joined
her
although
his
scream
was
faint
and
bluebreathless
the
plastic
bulged
out
later
they
would
all
agree
they
saw
it
bill
saw
the
bulb
of
the
clown
red
nose
flatten
the
way
your
nose
will
flatten
when
you
press
it
against
a
windowpane
kill
you
al
the
clown
was
laughing
and
screaming
try
to
stop
me
and
i'll
kill
you
all
drive
you
crazy
and
then
kill
you
all
you
can't
stop
me
i'm
the
gingerbread
man
i'm
the
teenage
werewol
and
for
a
moment
it
was
the
teenage
werewolf
the
moonsilvered
face
of
the
lycanthrope
peering
out
at
them
from
over
the
collar
of
the
silver
suit
white
teeth
bared
can't
stop
me
i'm
the
lepe
now
the
leper
face
haunted
and
peeling
rotting
with
sores
stared
at
them
with
the
eyes
of
the
living
dead
can't
stop
me
i'm
the
mummy
the
leper
face
aged
and
ran
with
sterile
cracks
ancient
bandages
swam
halfway
out
of
its
skin
and
solidified
there
ben
turned
away
his
face
as
white
as
curds
one
hand
plastered
over
his
neck
and
ear
can't
stop
me
i'm
the
dead
boy
no
stan
uris
screamed
his
eyes
bulged
above
braisedlooking
crescents
of
skin
shockflesh
bill
thought
randomly
and
it
was
a
word
he
would
use
in
a
novel
twelve
years
later
with
no
idea
where
it
had
come
from
simply
taking
it
as
writers
take
the
right
word
at
the
right
time
as
a
simple
gift
from
that
outer
space
otherspace
where
the
good
words
come
from
sometimes
stan
snatched
the
album
from
his
hands
and
slammed
it
shut
he
held
it
closed
with
both
hands
the
tendons
standing
out
along
the
inner
surfaces
of
his
wrists
and
forearms
he
looked
around
at
the
others
with
eyes
that
were
nearly
insane
n
he
said
rapidly
no
no
no
and
suddenly
bill
found
he
was
more
concerned
with
stan
repeated
denials
than
with
the
clown
and
he
understood
that
this
was
exactly
the
sort
of
reaction
the
clown
had
hoped
to
provoke
because
because
maybe
it
scared
us
really
scared
for
the
first
time
in
its
long
long
life
he
grabbed
stan
and
shook
him
twice
hard
holding
onto
his
shoulders
stan
teeth
clicked
together
and
he
dropped
the
album
mike
picked
it
up
and
put
it
aside
in
a
hurry
not
liking
to
touch
it
after
what
he
had
seen
but
it
was
still
his
fathers
and
he
understood
intuitively
that
his
father
would
never
see
in
it
what
he
had
just
seen
no
stan
said
softly
ye
bill
said
n
stan
said
again

ye
eddie
managed
gasping
it
out
of
his
rapidly
closing
throat
bill
looked
at
stan
demanding
with
his
eyes
that
stan
look
back
at
him
duhdon't
let

bill
said

wailed

stood
out
on
his
brow
in
an
oily
sheen
but
y
yyou
duhduhdid
stan
looked
at
the
others
one
by
one
he
ran
his
hands
through
his
short
hair
and
fetched
up
a
great
shuddering
sigh
his
eyes
seemed
to
clear
of
that
lowering
madness
that
had
so
disturbed
bill
ye
he
said
yes
okay
yes
that
what
you
want
yes
bill
thought
we're
still
all
together
it
didn't
stop
us
we
can
still
kill
it
we
can
still
kill
it
if
we're
brave
bill
looked
around
at
the
others
and
saw
in
each
pair
of
eyes
some
measure
of
stan
hysteria
not
quite
as
bad
but
there
yyyea
he
said
and
smiled
at
stan
after
a
moment
stan
smiled
back
and
some
of
that
horrible
shocked
look
left
his
face
that
what
i
wuh
wuhwanted
you
wehwehwet
end
beepbeep
dumbo
stan
said
and
they
all
laughed
it
was
hysterical
screaming
laughter
but
better
than
no
laughter
at
all
bill
reckoned
cccome
on
he
said
because
someone
had
to
say
something
let
fffinish
the
clubhouse
what
do
you
ss
say
he
saw
the
gratitude
in
their
eyes
and
felt
a
measure
of
gladness
for
them
but
their
gratitude
did
little
to
heal
his
own
horror
in
fact
there
was
something
in
their
gratitude
which
made
him
want
to
hate
them
would
he
never
be
able
to
express
his
own
terror
lest
the
fragile
welds
that
made
them
into
one
thing
should
let
go
and
even
to
think
such
a
thing
wasn't
really
fair
was
it
because
in
some
measure
at
least
he
was
using
them
using
his
friends
risking
their
lives
to
settle
the
score
for
his
dead
brother
and
was
even
that
the
bottom
no
because
george
was
dead
and
if
revenge
could
be
exacted
at
all
bill
suspected
it
could
only
be
exacted
on
behalf
of
the
living
and
what
did
that
make
him
a
selfish
little
shit
waving
a
tin
sword
and
trying
to
make
himself
look
like
king
arthur
oh
christ
he
groaned
to
himself
if
this
is
the
stuff
adults
have
to
think
about
i
never
want
to
grow
up
his
resolve
was
still
strong
but
it
was
a
bitter
resolve
bitter
chapter
the
smokehole
richie
tozier
pushes
his
glasses
up
on
his
nose
already
the
gesture
feels
perfectly
familiar
although
he
has
worn
contact
lenses
for
twenty
years
and
thinks
with
some
amazement
that
the
atmosphere
has
changed
in
the
room
while
mike
recalled
the
incident
with
the
bird
out
at
the
ironworks
and
reminded
them
about
his
father
photograph
album
and
the
picture
that
had
moved
richie
had
felt
a
mad
exhilarating
kind
of
energy
growing
in
the
room
he
had
done
cocaine
nine
or
ten
times
over
the
last
couple
of
years
at
parties
mostly
coke
wasn't
something
you
wanted
just
lying
around
your
house
if
you
were
a
biggatime
disc
jockey
and
the
feel
was
something
like
that
but
not
exactly
this
feeling
was
purer
more
of
a
mainline
high
he
thought
he
recognized
the
feeling
from
his
childhood
when
he
had
felt
it
every
day
and
had
come
to
take
it
merely
as
a
matter
of
course
he
supposed
that
if
he
had
ever
thought
about
that
deeprunning
aquifer
of
energy
as
a
kid
he
could
not
recall
that
he
ever
had
he
would
have
simply
dismissed
it
as
a
fact
of
life
something
that
would
always
be
there
like
the
color
of
his
eyes
or
his
disgusting
hammertoes
well
that
hadn't
turned
out
to
be
true
the
energy
you
drew
on
so
extravagantly
when
you
were
a
kid
the
energy
you
thought
would
never
exhaust
itself
that
slipped
away
somewhere
between
eighteen
and
twentyfour
to
be
replaced
by
something
much
duller
something
as
bogus
as
a
coke
high
purpose
maybe
or
goals
or
whatever
rahrah
junior
chamber
of
commerce
word
you
wanted
to
use
it
was
no
big
deal
it
didn't
go
all
at
once
with
a
bang
and
maybe
richie
thought
that
the
scary
part
how
you
don't
stop
being
a
kid
all
at
once
with
a
big
explosive
bang
like
one
of
that
clown
trick
balloons
with
the
burma
shave
slogans
on
the
sides
the
kid
in
you
just
leaked
out
like
the
air
out
of
a
tire
and
one
day
you
looked
in
the
mirror
and
there
was
a
grownup
looking
back
at
you
you
could
go
on
wearing
bluejeans
you
could
keep
going
to
springsteen
and
seger
concerts
you
could
dye
your
hair
but
that
was
a
grownup
face
in
the
mirror
just
the
same
it
all
happened
while
you
were
asleep
maybe
like
a
visit
from
the
tooth
fairy
no
he
thinks
not
the
tooth
fairy
the
age
fairy
he
laughs
aloud
at
the
stupid
extravagance
of
thisimage
and
when
beverly
looks
at
him
questioningly
he
waves
a
hand
at
her
nothing
babe
he
says
just
thinkin
me
thinks
but
now
that
energy
is
back
no
not
all
the
way
back
not
yet
anyway
but
coming
back
and
it
not
just
him
he
can
feel
it
filling
the
room
mike
looks
okay
to
richie
for
the
first
time
since
they
all
got
together
for
that
hideous
lunch
out
by
the
mall
when
richie
walked
into
the
lobby
and
saw
mike
sitting
there
with
ben
and
eddie
he
thought
shocked
there
a
man
who
going
crazy
getting
ready
to
commit
suicide
maybe
but
that
look
is
gone
now
not
just
sublimated
gone
richie
has
sat
right
here
and
watched
the
last
of
it
slip
out
of
mike
face
while
he
relived
the
experience
of
the
bird
and
the
album
he
been
energised
and
it
is
the
same
with
all
of
them
its
in
their
faces
their
voices
their
gestures
eddie
pours
himself
another
ginandprune
juice
bill
knocks
back
some
bourbon
and
mike
cracks
another
beer
beverly
glances
up
at
the
balloons
bill
has
tethered
to
the
microfilm
recorder
at
the
main
desk
and
finishes
her
third
screwdriver
in
a
hurry
they
have
all
been
drinking
pretty
enthusiastically
but
none
of
them
are
drunk
richie
doesn't
know
where
that
energy
he
feels
is
coming
from
but
its
not
out
of
a
liquor
bottle
derry
niggers
get
the
bird
blue
the
losers
are
still
losing
but
stanley
uris
is
finally
ahead
ori
ange
richie
thinks
opening
a
fresh
beer
for
himself
it
isn't
bad
enough
it
can
be
any
damn
monster
it
wants
to
be
and
it
isn't
bad
enough
that
it
can
feed
off
our
fears
it
also
turns
out
to
be
rodney
dangerfield
in
drag
it
eddie
who
breaks
the
silence
how
much
do
you
think
it
knows
about
what
we're
doing
now
he
asks
tt
was
here
wasn't
it
ben
says
t'm
not
sure
that
means
muc
eddie
replies
bill
nods
those
are
just
image
he
says
i'm
not
sure
that
means
it
can
see
us
or
know
what
we're
up
to
you
can
see
a
news
commentator
on
tv
but
he
can't
see
you
those
balloons
aren't
just
images
beverly
says
and
jerks
a
thumb
over
her
shoulder
at
them
they're
real
that
not
true
thoug
richie
says
and
they
all
look
at
him
images
are
real
sure
they
are
they
and
suddenly
something
else
clicks
into
place
something
new
it
clicks
into
place
with
such
firm
force
that
he
actually
puts
his
hands
to
his
ears
his
eyes
widen
behind
his
glasses
oh
my
god
he
cries
suddenly
he
gropes
for
the
table
halfstands
then
falls
back
into
his
chair
with
a
boneless
thud
he
knocks
his
can
of
beer
over
reaching
for
it
picks
it
up
and
drinks
what
left
he
looks
at
mike
while
the
others
look
at
him
startled
and
concerned
the
burning
he
almost
shouts
the
burning
in
my
eyes
mike
the
burning
in
my
eyes
mike
is
nodding
smiling
a
little
rrichie
'
bill
asks
what
iis
i
but
richie
barely
hears
him
the
force
of
the
memory
sweeps
through
him
like
a
tide
turning
him
alternately
hot
and
cold
and
he
suddenly
understands
why
these
memories
have
come
back
one
at
a
time
if
he
had
remembered
everything
at
once
the
force
would
have
been
like
a
psychological
shotgun
blast
let
off
an
inch
from
his
temple
it
would
have
torn
off
the
whole
top
of
his
head
we
saw
it
come
he
says
to
mike
we
saw
it
come
didn't
we
you
and
me
or
was
it
just
m
he
grabs
mike
hand
which
lies
on
the
table
did
you
see
it
too
mikey
or
was
it
just
me
did
you
see
it
the
forest
fire
the
crate
saw
it
mike
says
quietly
and
squeezes
richie
hand
richie
closes
his
eyes
for
a
moment
thinking
he
has
never
felt
such
a
warm
and
powerful
wave
of
relief
in
his
life
not
even
when
the
psa
jet
he
had
taken
from
la
to
san
francisco
skidded
off
the
runway
and
just
stopped
there
nobody
killed
nobody
even
hurt
some
luggage
had
fallen
out
of
the
overhead
bins
and
that
was
all
he
had
jumped
onto
the
yellow
emergency
slide
and
helped
a
woman
away
from
the
plane
the
woman
had
turned
her
ankle
on
a
hummock
concealed
in
the
high
grass
she
was
laughing
and
saying
i
can't
believe
i'm
not
dead
i
can't
believe
it
i
just
can't
believe
it
so
richie
who
was
halfcarrying
the
woman
with
one
arm
and
waving
with
the
other
to
the
firemen
who
were
making
frantic
comeon
gestures
to
the
deplaning
passengers
said
okay
you're
dead
you're
dead
you
feel
better
no
and
they
both
laughed
crazily
that
had
been
relieflaughter
but
this
relief
is
greater
what
are
you
guys
talking
abou
eddie
asks
looking
from
one
to
the
other
richie
looks
at
mike
but
mike
shakes
his
head
you
go
ahead
richie
i've
had
my
say
for
the
evening
the
rest
of
you
don't
know
or
maybe
don't
remember
because
you
lef
richie
tells
them
me
and
mikey
we
were
the
last
two
injuns
in
the
smokehole
the
smokehol
bill
muses
his
eyes
are
far
and
blue
the
burning
sensation
in
my
eye
richie
says
under
my
contact
lenses
i
felt
it
for
the
first
time
right
after
mike
called
me
in
california
i
didn't
know
what
it
was
then
but
i
do
now
it
was
smoke
smoke
that
was
twentyseven
years
old
he
looks
at
mike
psychological
would
you
say
psychosomatic
something
from
the
subconscious
'
would
say
no
mike
answers
quietly
i
would
say
that
what
you
felt
was
as
real
as
those
balloons
or
the
head
i
saw
in
the
icebox
or
the
corpse
of
tony
tracker
that
eddie
saw
tell
them
richie
richie
says
it
was
four
or
five
days
after
mike
brought
his
dad
album
down
to
the
barrens
sometime
just
after
the
middle
of
july
i
guess
the
clubhouse
was
done
but
the
smokehole
thing
that
was
your
idea
haystack
you
got
it
out
of
one
of
your
books
smiling
a
little
ben
nods
richie
thinks
it
was
overcast
that
day
no
breeze
thunder
in
the
air
like
the
day
a
month
or
so
later
when
we
stood
in
the
stream
and
made
a
circle
and
stan
cut
our
hands
with
that
chunk
of
coke
bottle
the
air
was
just
sitting
there
waiting
for
something
to
happen
and
later
bill
said
that
was
why
it
got
so
bad
in
there
so
quick
because
there
was
no
draft
july
th
yes
that
was
it
that
had
been
the
day
of
the
smokehole
july
th
almost
a
month
after
summer
vacation
began
and
the
nucleus
of
the
losers
bill
eddie
and
ben
had
formed
down
in
the
barrens
let
me
look
up
the
weather
forecast
for
that
day
almost
twentyseven
years
ago
richie
thinks
and
i'll
tell
you
what
it
said
before
i
even
read
it
richard
tozier
aka
the
great
mentalizer
hot
humid
chance
of
thundershowers
and
watch
out
for
the
visions
that
may
come
while
you're
down
in
the
smokehole

it
had
been
two
days
after
the
body
of
jimmy
cullum
was
discovered
the
day
after
mr
nell
had
come
down
to
the
barrens
again
and
sat
right
on
the
clubhouse
without
knowing
it
was
there
because
by
then
they
had
capped
it
off
and
ben
himself
had
carefully
overseen
the
replacement
of
the
sods
unless
you
got
right
down
on
your
hands
and
knees
and
crawled
around
you'd
have
no
idea
anything
was
there
like
the
dam
ben
clubhouse
had
been
a
roaring
success
but
this
time
mr
nell
didn't
know
anything
about
it
he
had
questioned
them
carefully
officially
taking
down
their
answers
in
his
black
notebook
but
there
had
been
little
they
could
tell
him
at
least
about
jimmy
cullum
and
mr
nell
had
gone
away
again
after
reminding
them
once
more
that
they
were
not
to
play
in
the
barrens
alone
ever
richie
guessed
that
mr
nell
would
have
told
them
simply
to
get
out
if
anyone
in
the
derry
police
department
had
really
believed
that
the
cullum
boy
or
any
of
the
others
had
actually
been
killed
in
the
barrens
but
they
knew
better
because
of
the
sewer
and
stormdrain
system
that
was
simply
where
the
remains
tended
to
finish
up
mr
nell
had
come
on
the
th
yes
a
hot
and
humid
day
also
but
sunny
the
th
had
been
overcast
are
you
going
to
talk
to
us
or
not
richi
bev
asks
she
is
smiling
a
little
her
lips
full
and
a
pale
rosered
her
eyes
alight
t'm
just
thinking
about
where
to
star
richie
says
he
takes
his
glasses
off
wipes
them
on
his
skirt
and
suddenly
he
knows
where
with
the
ground
opening
up
at
his
and
bill
feet
of
course
he
knew
about
the
clubhouse
so
did
bill
and
the
rest
of
them
but
it
still
freaked
him
out
seeing
the
ground
suddenly
open
on
a
slit
of
darkness
like
that
he
remembers
bill
riding
him
double
on
the
back
of
silver
to
the
usual
place
on
kansas
street
and
then
stowing
his
bike
under
the
little
bridge
he
remembers
the
two
of
them
walking
along
the
path
toward
the
clearing
sometimes
having
to
turn
sideways
because
the
brush
was
so
thick
it
was
midsummer
now
and
the
barrens
was
at
that
year
apogee
oflushness
he
remembers
swatting
at
the
mosquitoes
that
hummed
maddeningly
close
to
their
ears
he
even
remembers
bill
saying
oh
how
clearly
it
all
comes
back
not
as
if
it
happened
yesterday
but
as
if
it
is
happening
now
hhhold
it
a
sss
econd
ruhrichie
there
a
damn
guh
guhhood
one
on
the
bback
of
your
nehneck
oh
christ
richie
said
he
hated
mosquitoes
little
flying
vampires
that
all
they
were
when
you
got
right
down
to
the
facts
kill
it
big
bill
bill
swatted
the
back
of
richie
neck
ouch
sub
sub
see
bill
held
his
hand
in
front
of
richie
face
there
was
a
broken
mosquito
body
in
the
center
of
an
irregular
patch
of
blood
my
blood
richie
thought
which
was
shed
for
you
and
for
many
yeeic
he
said
ddon't
w
worry
bill
said
li'l
fucker'll
neh
never
dance
the
tuhtuh
tango
again
they
walked
on
slapping
at
mosquitoes
waving
at
the
clouds
of
noseeums
attracted
by
something
in
the
smell
of
their
sweat
something
which
would
years
later
be
identified
as
pheromones
whatever
they
were
bill
when
you
gonna
tell
the
rest
of
em
about
the
silver
bullets
richie
asked
as
they
approached
the
clearing
in
this
case
the
rest
of
the
meant
bev
eddie
mike
and
stan
although
richie
guessed
stan
already
had
a
good
idea
of
what
they
were
studying
up
on
down
at
the
public
library
stan
was
sharp
too
sharp
for
his
own
good
richie
sometimes
thought
the
day
mike
brought
his
father
album
down
to
the
barrens
stan
had
almost
flipped
out
richie
had
in
fact
been
nearly
convinced
that
they
wouldn't
see
stan
again
and
the
loser
club
would
become
a
sextet
a
word
richie
liked
a
lot
always
with
the
emphasis
on
the
first
syllable
but
stan
had
been
back
the
next
day
and
richie
had
respected
him
all
the
more
for
that
you
going
to
tell
them
today
nuhnot
ttoday
bill
said
you
don't
think
they'll
work
do
you
bill
shrugged
and
richie
who
maybe
understood
bill
denbrough
better
than
anyone
ever
would
until
audra
phillips
suspected
all
the
things
bill
might
have
said
if
not
for
the
roadblock
of
his
speech
impediment
that
kids
making
silver
bullets
was
boy
book
stuff
comicbook
stuff
in
a
word
it
was
crap
dangerous
crap
they
could
try
it
yeah
ben
hanscom
might
even
be
able
to
bring
it
off
yeah
in
a
movie
it
would
work
yeah
but
so
i
got
an
++iidea
bill
said
simpler
but
only
if
beh
behbeverly
if
beverly
what
nehhever
mind
and
bill
would
say
no
more
on
the
subject
they
came
into
the
clearing
if
you
looked
closely
you
might
have
thought
that
the
grass
there
had
a
slightly
matted
look
a
slightly
used
look
you
might
even
have
thought
that
there
was
something
a
bit
artificial
almost
arranged
about
the
scatter
of
leaves
and
pine
needles
on
top
of
the
sods
bill
picked
up
a
ringding
wrapper
ben
almost
certainly
and
put
it
absently
in
his
pocket
the
boys
crossed
to
the
center
of
the
clearing
and
a
piece
of
ground
about
ten
inches
long
by
three
inches
wide
swung
up
with
a
dirty
squall
of
hinges
revealing
a
black
eyelid
eyes
looked
out
of
that
blackness
giving
richie
a
momentary
chill
but
they
were
only
eddie
kaspbrak
eyes
and
it
was
eddie
whom
he
would
visit
in
the
hospital
a
week
later
who
intoned
hollowly
who
that
trip
trapping
on
my
bridge
giggles
from
below
and
a
flashlight
flicker
thees
ees
the
rurales
senhorr
richie
said
squatting
down
twirling
an
invisible
mustache
and
speaking
in
his
pancho
vanilla
voice
yea
beverly
asked
from
below
let
see
your
badges
batches
richie
cried
delighted
we
dean
need
no
stinkin
batches
go
to
hell
pancho
eddie
replied
and
slammed
the
big
eyelid
closed
there
were
more
muffled
giggles
from
below
come
out
with
your
hands
up
bill
cried
in
a
low
commanding
adult
vore
he
began
to
tramp
back
and
forth
across
the
sodcovered
cap
of
the
clubhouse
he
could
see
the
ground
springing
up
and
down
with
his
backandforth
passage
but
just
barely
they
had
built
well
you
haven't
got
a
chance
he
bellowed
seeing
himself
æ
fearless
joe
friday
of
the
lapd
in
his
mind
eye
come
on
out
of
there
punks
or
we'll
come
in
shootin
he
jumped
up
and
down
once
to
emphasize
his
point
screams
and
giggles
from
below
bill
was
smiling
unaware
that
richie
was
looking
at
him
wisely
looking
at
him
not
as
one
child
looks
at
another
but
in
that
brief
moment
as
an
adult
looks
at
a
child
he
doesn't
know
that
he
doesn't
always
richie
thought
let
them
in
ben
before
they
crash
the
roof
in
bev
said
a
moment
later
a
trapdoor
flopped
open
like
the
hatch
of
a
submarine
ben
looked
out
he
was
flushed
richie
knew
at
once
that
ben
had
been
sitting
next
to
beverly
bill
and
richie
dropped
down
through
the
hatch
and
ben
closed
it
again
then
there
they
all
were
sitting
snug
against
board
walls
with
their
legs
drawn
up
their
faces
dimly
revealed
in
the
beam
of
ben
flashlight
ssso
whwhat
gggoing
oon
bill
asked
not
too
much
ben
said
he
was
indeed
sitting
next
to
beverly
and
his
face
looked
happy
as
well
as
flushed
we
were
just
tell
em
ben
eddie
interrupted
tell
em
the
story
see
what
they
think
wouldn't
do
much
for
your
asthma
stan
told
eddie
in
his
best
someonehastobe
practicak
here
tone
of
voice
richie
sat
between
mike
and
ben
holding
his
knees
in
his
linked
hands
it
was
delightfully
cool
down
here
delightfully
secret
following
the
gleam
of
the
flashlight
as
it
moved
from
face
to
face
he
temporarily
forgot
what
had
so
astounded
him
outside
only
a
minute
ago
what
are
you
talkin
about
oh
ben
was
telling
us
a
story
about
this
indian
ceremony
bev
said
but
stan
right
it
wouldn't
be
very
good
for
your
asthma
eddie
tt
might
not
bother
it
eddie
said
sounding
to
his
credit
richie
thought
only
a
little
uneasy
usually
it
only
when
i
get
upset
anyway
i'd
like
to
try
it
try
w
w
what
bill
asked
him
the
smokehole
ceremony
eddie
said
w
w
what
th
that
the
beam
of
ben
flashlight
drifted
upward
and
richie
followed
it
with
his
eyes
it
tracked
aimlessly
across
the
wooden
roof
of
their
clubhouse
as
ben
explained
it
crossed
the
gouged
and
splintered
panels
of
the
mahogany
door
the
seven
of
them
had
carried
back
here
from
the
dump
three
days
ago
the
day
before
the
body
of
jimmy
cullum
was
discovered
the
thing
richie
remembered
about
jimmy
cullum
a
quiet
little
boy
who
also
wore
spectacles
was
that
he
liked
to
play
scrabble
on
rainy
days
not
going
to
be
playing
scrabble
anymore
richie
thought
and
shivered
a
little
in
the
dimness
no
one
saw
the
shiver
but
mike
hanlon
sitting
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
him
glanced
at
him
curiously
well
i
got
this
book
out
of
the
library
last
week
ben
was
saying
ghosts
of
the
great
plains
it
called
and
it
all
about
the
indian
tribes
that
lived
out
west
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
ago
the
paiutes
and
the
pawnees
and
the
kiowas
and
the
otoes
and
the
comanches
it
was
really
a
good
book
i'd
love
to
go
out
there
sometime
to
where
they
lived
iowa
nebraska
colorado
utah
shut
up
and
tell
about
the
smokehole
ceremony
beverly
said
elbowing
him
sure
he
said
right
and
richie
believed
his
response
would
have
been
the
same
if
beverly
had
given
him
the
elbow
and
said
drink
the
poison
now
ben
okay
see
almost
all
those
indians
had
a
special
ceremony
and
our
clubhouse
made
me
think
of
it
whenever
they
had
to
make
a
big
decision
whether
to
move
on
after
the
buffalo
herds
or
to
find
fresh
water
or
whether
or
not
to
fight
their
enemies
they'd
dig
a
big
hole
in
the
ground
and
cover
it
up
with
branches
except
for
a
little
vent
in
the
top
the
smuhsmuhsmokehol
bill
said
your
quick
mind
never
ceases
to
amaze
me
big
bill
richie
said
gravely
you
ought
to
go
on
twentyone
i'll
bet
you
could
even
beat
ole
charlie
van
doren
bill
made
as
if
to
hit
him
and
richie
recoiled
bumping
his
head
a
pretty
good
one
on
a
piece
of
shoring
ouch
you
ddeserved
it
bill
said
i
keel
you
rotten
gringo
sumbees
richie
said
we
doan
need
no
stinkin
will
you
guys
stop
it
beverly
asked
this
is
interesting
and
she
favored
ben
with
such
a
warm
look
that
richie
believed
steam
would
start
curling
out
of
haystack
ears
in
a
couple
of
minutes
okay
bbbe
bill
said
go
on
sure
ben
said
the
word
came
out
in
a
croak
he
had
to
clear
his
throat
and
start
again
when
the
smokehole
was
finished
they'd
start
a
fire
down
there
they'd
use
green
wood
so
it
would
be
a
really
smoky
fire
then
all
the
braves
would
go
down
there
and
sit
around
the
fire
the
place
would
fill
up
with
smoke
the
book
said
this
was
a
religious
ceremony
but
it
was
also
kind
of
a
contest
you
know
after
half
a
day
or
so
most
of
the
braves
would
bug
out
because
they
couldn't
stand
the
smoke
anymore
and
only
two
or
three
would
be
left
and
they
were
supposed
to
have
visions
yeah
if
i
breathed
smoke
for
five
or
six
hours
i'd
probably
have
some
visions
all
right
mike
said
and
they
all
laughed
the
visions
were
supposed
to
tell
the
tribe
what
to
do
ben
said
and
i
don't
know
if
this
part
is
true
or
not
but
the
book
said
that
most
times
the
visions
were
right
a
silence
fell
and
richie
looked
at
bill
he
was
aware
that
they
were
all
looking
at
bill
and
he
had
the
feeling
again
that
ben
story
of
the
smokehole
was
more
than
a
thing
you
read
about
in
a
book
and
then
had
to
try
for
yourself
like
a
chemistry
experiment
or
a
magic
trick
he
knew
it
they
all
knew
it
perhaps
ben
knew
it
most
of
all
this
was
something
they
were
supposed
to
do
they
were
supposed
to
have
visions
most
times
the
visions
were
right
richie
thought
ti
bet
if
we
asked
him
haystack
would
tell
us
that
book
practically
jumped
into
his
hand
like
something
wanted
him
to
read
that
one
particular
book
and
then
tell
us
about
the
smokehole
ceremony
because
there
a
tribe
right
here
isn't
there
yeah
us
and
yeah
i
guess
we
do
need
to
know
what
happens
next
this
thought
led
to
another
was
this
supposed
to
happen
from
the
time
ben
got
the
idea
for
an
underground
clubhouse
instead
of
a
treehouse
was
this
supposed
to
happen
how
much
of
this
are
we
thinking
up
ourselves
and
how
much
is
being
thought
up
for
us
in
a
way
he
supposed
such
an
idea
should
have
been
almost
comforting
it
was
nice
to
imagine
that
something
bigger
than
you
smarter
than
you
was
doing
your
thinking
for
you
like
the
adults
that
planned
your
meals
bought
your
clothes
and
managed
your
time
and
richie
was
convinced
that
the
force
that
had
brought
them
together
the
force
that
had
used
ben
as
its
messenger
to
bring
them
the
idea
of
the
smokehole
that
force
wasn't
the
same
as
the
one
killing
the
children
this
was
some
kind
of
counterforce
to
that
other
to
oh
well
you
might
as
well
say
it
it
but
all
the
same
he
didn't
like
this
feeling
of
not
being
in
control
of
his
own
actions
of
being
managed
of
being
run
they
all
looked
at
bill
they
all
waited
to
see
what
bill
would
say
yyou
nuhnuhkno
he
said
that
sounds
rihreally
nneat
beverly
sighed
and
stan
stirred
uncomfortably
that
was
all
rihnhreally
nuhneat
bill
repeated
looking
down
at
his
hands
and
perhaps
it
was
only
the
uneasy
flashlight
beam
in
ben
hands
or
his
own
imagination
but
richie
thought
bill
looked
a
little
pale
and
a
lot
scared
although
he
was
smiling
maybe
we
could
wuse
a
vib
hision
to
tell
us
what
to
dddo
about
oour
pruh
pruhhoblem
and
if
anyone
has
a
vision
richie
thought
it
will
be
bill
but
about
that
he
was
wrong
well
ben
said
it
probably
only
works
for
indians
but
it
might
be
flippy
to
try
it
yeah
we'll
probably
all
pass
out
from
the
smoke
and
die
in
here
stan
said
gloomily
that'd
be
really
flippy
all
right
you
don't
want
to
stan
eddie
asked
well
i
sort
of
d
stan
said
he
sighed
i
think
you
guys
are
making
me
crazy
you
know
i
he
looked
at
bill
whe
bill
said
w
well
nun
no
ttime
like
the
puhpuhpuhhresent
+is
there
there
was
a
startled
thoughtful
silence
then
richie
got
to
his
feet
straightarming
the
trapdoor
open
and
letting
in
the
muted
light
of
that
still
summer
day
i
got
my
hatchet
ben
said
following
him
out
who
wants
to
help
ne
cut
some
green
wood
in
the
end
they
all
helped
it
took
them
about
an
hour
to
get
ready
they
cut
four
or
five
armloads
of
small
green
branches
from
which
ben
had
stripped
the
twigs
and
leaves
they'll
smoke
all
right
he
said
i
don't
even
know
if
we'll
be
able
to
get
them
going
beverly
and
richie
went
down
to
the
bank
of
the
kenduskeag
and
brought
back
a
collection
of
goodsized
stones
using
eddie
jacket
his
mother
always
made
him
take
a
jacket
even
if
it
was
eighty
degrees
it
might
rain
mrs
kaspbrak
said
and
if
you
have
a
jacket
to
put
on
your
skin
won't
get
soaked
if
it
does
as
a
makeshift
sling
carrying
the
rocks
back
to
the
clubhouse
richie
said
you
can't
do
this
bev
you're
a
girl
ben
said
it
was
just
the
braves
that
went
down
in
the
smokehole
not
the
squaws
beverly
paused
looking
at
richie
with
mixed
amusement
and
irritation
a
lock
of
hair
had
escaped
from
her
ponytail
she
pushed
out
her
lower
lip
and
blew
it
off
her
forehead
i
could
wrestle
you
to
a
fall
any
day
richie
and
you
know
it
dat
doan
mattuh
miss

his
eyes
at
her

you

always
goan

sho

lawksamussy
miss
scawlett
i

richie
screeched
and
beverly
laughed
so
hard
she
dropped
her
end
of
eddie
jacket
and
all
the
stones
fell
out
she
scolded
richie
all
the
time
they
were
picking
them
up
again
and
richie
joked
and
screeched
in
many
voices
and
thought
to
himself
how
beautiful
she
was
although
richie
had
not
been
serious
when
he
spoke
of
excluding
her
from
the
smoke
hole
on
the
basis
of
her
sex
bill
denbrough
apparently
was
she
stood
facing
him
her
hands
on
her
hips
her
cheeks
flushed
with
anger
you
can
just
take
that
and
stuff
it
with
a
long
pole
stuttering
bill
im
in
on
this
too
or
aren't
i
a
member
of
your
lousy
club
anymore
patiently
bill
said
fit
not
hike
that
bbbev
and
yyou
nunknow
tit
somebody
has
to
stay
uuhup
here
why
bill
tried
but
the
roadblock
was
in
again
he
looked
at
eddie
for
help
its
what
stan
said
eddie
told
her
quietly
about
the
smoke
bill
says
that
might
really
happen
we
could
pass
out
down
there
then
we'd
die
bill
says
that
what
happens
to
most
people
in
housefires
they
don't
burn
up
they
choke
to
death
on
the
smoke
they
now
she
turned
to
eddie
well
okay
he
wants
somebody
to
stay
up
on
top
in
case
there
trouble
miserably
eddie
nodded
well
what
about
you
you're
the
one
with
the
asthma
eddie
said
nothing
she
turned
back
to
bill
the
others
stood
around
hands
in
their
pockets
looking
at
their
sneakers
tt
because
i'm
a
girl
isn't
it
that
really
it
isn't
it
behbeh
beb
beh
you
don't
have
to
talk
she
snapped
just
nod
your
head
or
shake
it
your
head
doesn't
stutter
does
it
is
it
because
i'm
a
girl
reluctantly
bill
nodded
his
head
she
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
her
lips
trembling
and
richie
thought
she
would
cry
instead
she
exploded
well
fuck
you
she
whirled
around
to
look
at
the
others
and
they
flinched
from
her
gaze
so
hot
it
was
nearly
radioactive
fuck
all
of
you
if
you
think
the
same
thing
she
turned
back
to
bill
and
began
to
talk
fast
rapping
him
with
words
this
is
something
more
than
sone
diddlyshit
kid
game
like
tag
or
guns
or
hideandgoseek
and
you
know
it
bill
we're
supposed
to
do
this
that
part
of
it
and
you're
not
going
to
cut
me
out
just
because
i'm
a
girl
do
you
understand
you
better
or
i'm
leaving
right
now
and
if
i
go
i'm
gone
for
good
you
understand
she
stopped
bill
looked
at
her
he
seemed
to
have
regained
his
calm
but
richie
felt
afraid
he
felt
that
any
chance
they
had
of
winning
of
finding
a
way
to
get
to
the
thing
that
had
killed
georgie
denbrough
and
the
other
kids
getting
to
it
and
killing
it
was
now
in
jeopardy
seven
richie
thought
that
the
magic
number
there
has
to
be
seven
of
us
that
the
way
it
supposed
to
be
a
bird
sang
somewhere
stopped
sang
again
aa
rright
bill
said
and
richie
let
his
breath
out
but
suhsuhsomebody
has
to
s
stay
tuhhopside
who
ww
wants
to
ddo
it
richie
thought
eddie
or
stan
would
surely
volunteer
for
this
duty
but
eddie
said
nothing
stan
stood
pale
and
thoughtful
and
silent
mike
had
his
thumbs
hooked
into
his
belt
like
steve
mcqueen
in
wanted
dead
or
alive
nothing
moving
but
his
eyes
cuhcuhcome
oo
bill
said
and
richie
realized
that
all
pretense
had
gone
out
of
the
thing
now
bev
impassioned
speech
and
bill
grave
tooold
face
had
seen
to
that
this
was
a
part
of
it
perhaps
as
dangerous
as
the
expedition
he
and
bill
had
made
to
the
house
at
neibolt
street
they
knew
it
and
no
one
was
backing
down
suddenly
he
was
very
proud
of
them
very
proud
to
be
with
them
after
all
the
years
of
being
counted
out
he
was
counted
in
finally
counted
in
he
didn't
know
if
they
were
still
losers
or
not
but
he
knew
they
were
together
they
were
friends
damn
good
friends
richie
took
his
glasses
off
and
rubbed
them
vigorously
with
the
tail
of
his
shirt
i
know
how
to
do
it
bev
said
and
took
a
book
of
matches
from
her
pocket
on
the
front
so
tiny
you'd
need
a
magnifying
glass
to
get
a
really
good
look
at
them
were
pictures
of
that
year
candidates
for
the
title
of
miss
rheingold
beverly
lit
a
match
and
then
blew
it
out
she
tore
out
six
more
and
added
the
burned
match
she
turned
away
from
them
and
when
she
turned
back
the
white
ends
of
the
seven
matches
poked
out
of
her
closed
fist
pick
she
said
holding
the
matches
out
to
bill
the
one
who
picks
the
match
with
the
burned
head
stays
up
here
and
pulls
the
rest
out
if
they
go
flippy
bill
looked
at
her
levelly
ththis
is
hhhow
you
w
want
rit
she
smiled
at
him
then
and
her
smile
made
her
face
radiant
yeah
you
big
dummy
this
is
how
i
want
it
what
about
you
luhluh
love
you
bbbe
he
said
and
color
rose
in
her
cheeks
like
hasty
flames
bill
did
not
appear
to
notice
he
studied
the
matchtails
sucking
out
of
her
fist
and
at
length
he
picked
one
its
head
was
blue
and
unburned
she
turned
to
ben
and
offered
the
remaining
six
love
you
too
ben
said
hoarsely
his
face
was
plumcolored
he
looked
like
he
was
on
the
verge
of
a
stroke
but
no
one
laughed
somewhere
deeper
in
the
barrens
the
bird
sang
again
stan
would
know
what
it
was
richie
thought
randomly
thank
you
she
said
smiling
and
ben
picked
a
match
its
head
was
unburned
she
offered
them
to
eddie
next
eddie
smiled
a
shy
smile
that
was
incredibly
sweet
and
almost
heartbreakingly
vulnerable
i
guess
i
love
you
too
bev
he
said
and
then
picked
a
match
blindly
its
head
was
blue
beverly
now
offered
the
four
matchtails
in
her
hand
to
richie
ah
loves
yuh
miss
scawlet
richie
screamed
at
the
top
of
his
voice
and
made
exaggerated
kissing
gestures
with
his
lips
beverly
only
looked
at
him
smiling
a
little
and
richie
suddenly
felt
ashamed
i
do
love
you
bev
he
said
and
touched
her
hair
you're
cool
thank
you
she
said
he
picked
a
match
and
looked
at
it
positive
he'd
picked
the
burned
one
but
he
hadn't
she
offered
them
to
stan
love
you
stan
said
and
plucked
one
of
the
matches
from
her
fist
unburned
you
and
me
mike
she
said
and
offered
him
his
pick
of
the
two
left
he
stepped
forward
i
don't

well
enough
to
love
yo
he
said
but
i
love
you
anyway
you
could
give
my
mother
shoutin
lessons

guess
they
all
laughed
and
mike
took
a
match

head
was
also
unburned
i
guess
it
yy
you
aafter
all
bev
bill
said
looking
disgusted
all
that
flash
and
fire
for
nothing
beverly
opened
her
hand

head
of
the
remaining
match
was
also
blue
and
unburned
yyyou
jihjigjiggered
them
bill
accused

i
didn't
her
tone
was
not
one
of
angry
protest
which
would
have
been
suspect
but
flabbergasted
surprise
honest
to
god
i
didn't
then
she
showed
them
her
palm
they
all
saw
the
faint
mark
of
soot
from
the
burned
match
head
there
bill
i
swear
on
my
mother
name
bill
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
and
then
nodded
by
common
unspoken
consent
they
all
handed
the
matches
back
to
bill
seven
of
them
their
heads
intact
stan
and
eddie
began
to
crawl
around
on
the
ground
but
there
was
no
burned
match
there
i
didn't
beverly
said
again
to
no
one
in
particular
so

because

the
bird
sang
again
ben
and
richie
went
down
first
and
the
others
handed
the
rocks
down
one
by
one
richie
passed
them
on
to
ben
who
made
a
small
stone
circle
in
the
middle
of
the
dirt
clubhouse
floor
oka
he
said
that
enough
the
others
came
down
each
with
a
handful
of
the
green
twigs
they'd
cut
with
ben
hatchet
bill
came
last
he
closed
the
trapdoor
and
opened
the
narrow
hinged
window
th
thther
he
said
th
there
our
smuhsmokehole
do
we
hhave
any
kihkihkindling
you
can
use
this
if
you
want
mike
said
and
took
a
battered
archie
funnybook
out
of
his
hip
pocket
i
read
it
already
bill
tore
the
pages
out
of
the
funnybook
one
by
one
working
slowly
and
gravely
the
others
sat
around
the
walls
knee
to
knee
and
shoulder
to
shoulder
watching
not
speaking
the
tension
was
thick
and
still
bill
laid
small
twigs
and
branches
over
the
paper
and
then
looked
at
beverly
yyyou
g
got
the
muh
matches
he
said
she
lit
one
a
tiny
yellow
flare
in
the
gloom
darn
thing
probably
won't
catch
anywa
she
said
in
a
slightly
uneven
voice
and
touched
a
light
to
the
paper
in
several
places
when
the
matchflame
got
close
to
her
fingers
she
tossed
it
into
the
center
the
flames
blazed
up
yellow
crackling
throwing
their
faces
into
sharp
relief
and
in
that
moment
richie
had
no
trouble
believing
ben
indian
story
and
he
thought
it
must
have
been
like
this
back
in
those
old
days
when
the
idea
of
white
men
was
still
no
more
than
a
rumor
or
a
tall
tale
to
those
indians
who
followed
buffalo
herds
so
big
they
could
cover
the
earth
from
horizon
to
horizon
herds
so
big
that
their
passing
shook
the
ground
like
an
earthquake
in
that
moment
richie
could
picture
those
indians
kiowas
or
pawnees
or
whatever
they
were
down
in
their
smokehole
knee
to
knee
and
shoulder
to
shoulder
watching
as
the
flames
guttered
and
sank
into
the
green
wood
like
hot
sores
listening
to
the
faint
and
steady
ssssss
of
sap
oozing
out
of
the
damp
wood
waiting
for
the
vision
to
descend
yeah
sitting
here
now
he
could
believe
it
all
and
looking
at
their
somber
faces
as
they
studied
the
flames
and
the
charring
pages
of
mike
archie
funny
book
he
could
see
that
they
believed
it
too
the
branches
were
catching
the
clubhouse
began
to
fill
up
with
smoke
some
of
it
white
as
cotton
smokesignals
in
a
saturdaymatinee
movie
starring
randolph
scott
or
audie
murphy
escaped
from
the
smokehole
but
with
no
moving
air
outside
to
create
a
draft
most
of
it
stayed
below
it
had
an
acrid
bite
that
made
eyes
sting
and
throats
throb
richie
heard
eddie
cough
twice
a
flat
sound
like
dry
boards
being
whacked
together
and
then
fall
silent
again
he
shouldn't
be
down
here
he
thought
but
something
else
apparently
felt
otherwise
bill
tossed
another
handful
of
green
twigs
on
the
smoldering
fire
and
asked
in
a
thin
voice
that
was
not
much
like
his
usual
speaking
voice
anyone
having
a
any
vih
vihvision
visions
of
getting
out
of
here
stan
uris
said
beverly
laughed
at
this
but
her
laughter
turned
into
a
fit
of
coughing
and
choking
richie
leaned
his
head
back
against
the
wall
and
looked
up
at
the
smokehole
a
thin
rectangle
of
mellow
white
light
he
thought
about
the
paul
bunyan
statue
that
day
in
march
but
that
had
only
been
a
mirage
a
hallucination
a
vision
smoke
killin
m
ben
said
who
so
leave
richie
murmured
not
taking
his
eyes
off
the
smokehole
he
felt
as
if
he
was
getting
a
handle
on
this
he
felt
as
if
he
had
lost
ten
pounds
and
he
sure
as
shit
felt
as
if
the
clubhouse
had
gotten
bigger
damn
straight
on
that
last
he
had
been
sitting
with
ben
hanscom
fat
right
leg
squashed
against
his
left
one
and
bill
denbrough
bony
left
shoulder
socked
into
his
right
arm
now
he
was
touching
neither
of
them
he
glanced
lazily
to
his
right
and
left
to
verify
that
his
perception
was
true
and
it
was
ben
was
a
foot
or
so
to
his
left
on
his
right
bill
was
even
farther
away
place
is
bigger
friends
and
neighbors
he
said
he
took
a
deeper
breath
and
coughed
hard
it
hurt
hurt
deep
in
his
chest
the
way
a
cough
hurt
when
you
had
the
flu
or
the
grippe
or
something
for
awhile
he
thought
it
would
never
pass
that
he
would
just
go
on
coughing
until
they
had
to
pull
him
out
zf
they
still
can
he
thought
but
the
thought
was
really
too
dim
to
be
frightening
then
bill
was
pounding
him
on
the
back
and
the
coughing
fit
passed
you
don't
know
you
don't
always
richie
said
he
was
looking
at
the
smokehole
again
instead
of
at
bill
how
bright
it
seemed
when
he
closed
his
eyes
he
could
still
see
the
rectangle
floating
there
in
the
dark
but
bright
green
instead
of
bright
white
whuh
whuhwhat
do
you
mmean
bill
asked
stutter
he
paused
aware
that
someone
else
was
coughing
but
not
sure
who
it
was
you
ought
to
do
the
voices
not
me
big
bill
you
the
coughing
got
louder
suddenly
the
clubhouse
was
flooded
with
daylight
so
sudden
and
so
bright
richie
had
to
squint
against
it
he
could
just
make
out
stan
uris
climbing
and
clawing
his
way
out
sorry
stan
managed
through
his
spasmodic
coughing
sorry
can't
all
right
richie
heard
himself
say
you
doan
need
no
stinkin
batches
his
voice
sounded
as
if
it
were
coming
from
a
different
body
the
trapdoor
slammed
shut
a
moment
later
but
enough
fresh
air
had
come
in
to
clear
his
head
a
little
before
ben
moved
over
a
little
to
fill
the
space
stan
had
vacated
richie
became
aware
of
ben
leg
again
pressing
his
how
had
he
gotten
the
idea
that
the
clubhouse
had
gotten
bigger
mike
hanlon
threw
more
sticks
on
the
smoky
fire
richie
resumed
taking
shallow
breaths
and
looking
up
at
the
smokehole
he
had
no
sense
of
real
time
passing
but
he
was
vaguely
aware
that
in
addition
to
the
smoke
the
clubhouse
was
getting
good
and
hot
he
looked
around
looked
at
his
friends
they
were
hard
to
see
halfswallowed
in
shadowsmoke
and
still
white
summerlight
bev
head
was
tilted
back
against
a
piece
of
shoring
her
hands
on
her
knees
her
eyes
closed
tears
trickling
down
her
cheeks
toward
her
earlobes
bill
was
sitting
crosslegged
his
chin
on
his
chest
ben
was
but
suddenly
ben
was
getting
to
his
feet
pushing
the
trapdoor
open
again
there
goes
ben
mike
said
he
was
sitting
indianfashion
directly
across
from
richie
his
eyes
as
red
as
a
weasel
comparative
coolness
struck
them
again
the
air
freshened
as
smoke
swirled
up
through
the
trap
ben
was
coughing
and
dryretching
he
pulled
himself
out
with
stan
help
and
before
either
of
them
could
close
the
trapdoor
eddie
was
staggering
to
his
feet
his
face
a
deadly
pale
except
for
the
bruisedlooking
patches
under
his
eyes
and
traced
just
below
his
cheekbones
his
thin
chest
was
hitching
up
and
down
in
quick
shallow
spasms
he
groped
weakly
for
the
edge
of
the
escape
hatch
and
would
have
fallen
if
ben
had
not
grabbed
hand
and
stan
the
other
sorry
eddie
managed
in
a
squeaky
little
whisper
and
then
they
hauled
him
up
the
trapdoor
banged
down
again
there
was
a
long
quiet
period
the
smoke
built
up
until
it
was
a
thick
still
fog
in
the
clubhouse
looks
like
a
peasouper
to
me
watson
richie
thought
and
for
a
moment
he
imagined
himself
as
sherlock
holmes
a
holmes
who
looked
a
great
deal
like
basil
rathbone
and
who
was
totally
black
and
white
moving
purposefully
along
baker
street
moriarty
was
somewhere
near
a
hansom
cab
awaited
and
the
game
was
afoot
the
thought
was
amazingly
clear
amazingly
solid
it
seemed
almost
to
have
weight
as
if
it
were
not
a
little
pocketdaydream
of
the
sort
he
had
all
the
time
batting
cleanup
for
the
bosox
bottom
of
the
ninth
bases
loaded
and
there
it
goes
it
up
its
gone
home
run
tozier
and
that
breaks
the
babe
record
but
something
that
was
almost
real
there
was
still
enough
of
the
wiseacre
in
him
to
think
that
if
all
he
was
getting
out
of
this
was
a
vision
of
basil
rathbone
as
sherlock
holmes
then
the
whole
idea
of
visions
was
pretty
overrated
except
of
course
it
isn't
moriarty
that
out
there
it
out
there
some
itand
it
real
itthen
the
trapdoor
opened
again
and
beverly
was
struggling
her
way
out
coughing
dryly
one
hand
cupped
over
her
mouth
ben
got
one
hand
and
stan
grabbed
her
under
the
other
arm
half
pulled
halfscrambling
under
her
own
power
she
was
up
and
gone
ibib
it
iis
bihigger
bill
said
richie
looked
around
he
saw
the
circle
of
stones
with
the
fire
smoldering
within
fuming
out
clouds
of
smoke
across
the
way
he
saw
mike
sitting
crosslegged
like
a
totem
carved
from
mahogany
staring
at
him
through
the
fire
with
his
smokereddened
eyes
except
mike
was
better
than
twenty
yards
away
and
bill
was
even
farther
away
on
richie
right
the
underground
clubhouse
was
now
at
least
the
size
of
a
ballroom
doesn't
matter
mike
said
it
gonna
come
pretty
quick
somethin
is
yyyea
bill
said
but
i
i
i
he
began
to
cough
he
fried
to
conio
it
but
the
cough
worsened
a
dry
rattling
dimly
richie
saw
bill
stumble
to
his
feet
lunge
for
the
trapdoor
and
shove
it
open
gubguhgood
luh
luhluh
and
then
he
was
gone
dragged
up
by
the
others
looks
like
it
you
and
me
ole
mikey
richie
said
and
then
he
began
to
cough
himself
i
thought
for
sure
that
it
would
be
bill
the
cough
worsened
he
doubled
over
hacking
dryly
unable
to
get
his
breath
his
head
was
thudding
whacking
like
a
tumip
filled
with
blood
his
eyes
teared
behind
his
glasses
from
far
away
he
heard
mike
saying
go
on
up
if
you
have
to
richie
don't
go
flippy
don't
kill
yourself
he
raised
a
hand
toward
mike
and
flapped
it
at
him
no
stinkin
batches
in
a
negative
gesture
little
by
little
he
began
to
get
the
coughing
under
control
again
mike
was
right
something
was
going
to
happen
and
soon
he
wanted
to
still
be
here
when
it
did
he
tilted
his
head
back
and
looked
up
at
the
smokehole
again
the
coughing
fit
had
left
him
feeling
light
headed
and
now
he
seemed
to
be
floating
on
a
cushion
of
air
it
was
a
pleasant
feeling
he
took
shallow
breaths
and
thought
someday
i'm
going
to
be
a
rockand
roll
star
that
it
yes
i'll
be
famous
i'll
make
records
and
albums
and
movies
i'll
have
a
black
sportcoat
and
white
shoes
and
a
yellow
cadillac
and
when
i
come
back
to
derry
they'll
all
eat
their
hearts
out
even
bowers
i
wear
glasses
but
what
the
fuck
buddy
holly
wears
glasses
i'll
bop
till
i'm
blue
and
dance
till
fm
black
i'll
be
the
first
rockandroll
star
to
ever
come
from
maine
i'll
the
thought
drifted
away
it
didn't
matter
he
found
that
now
he
didnt
need
to
take
shallow
breaths
his
lungs
had
adapted
he
could
breathe
as
much
smoke
as
he
wanted
maybe
he
was
from
venus
mike
threw
more
sticks
on
the
fire
not
to
be
outdone
richie
tossed
on
another
handful
himself
how
you
feeling
rich
mike
asked
richie
smiled
better
good
almost
you
mike
nodded
and
smiled
back
i
feel
okay
have
you
been
having
some
funny
thoughts
yeah
thought
i
was
sherlock
holmes
for
a
minute
there
then
i
thought
i
could
dance

dovells
your
eyes
are
so
red
you
wouldn't
believe
it

wanna
say

got
the
word

it
mikey
yeah
okay
they
grinned
at
each
other
and
then
richie
let
his
head
tilt
back
against
the
wall
again
and
looked
up
at
the
smokehole
shortly
he
began
to
drift
away
no
not
away
up
he
was
drifting
up
like
float
down
here
we
all
a
balloon
yuhyuh
you
ggguys
all
rright
bill
voice
coming
down
through
the
smokehole
coming
from
venus
worried
richie
felt
himself
thud
back
down
inside
himself
all
righ
he
heard
his
voice
distant
irritated
all
right
we
said
all
right
be
quiet
bill
let
us
get
the
word
we
wanna
say
we
got
the
world
word
the
clubhouse
was
bigger
than
ever
floored
now
in
some
polished
wood
the
smoke
was
fogthick
and
it
was
hard
to
see
the
fire
that
floor
jesuscomepleaseus
it
was
as
big
as
a
ballroom
floor
in
an
mgm
musical
extravaganza
mike
looked
at
him
from
the
other
side
a
shape
almost
lost
in
the
fog
you
coming
ale
mikey
right
here
with
you
richie
you
still
want
to
say
all
right
yeah
but
hold
my
hand
can
you
catch
hold
i
think
so
richie
held
his
hand
out
and
although
mike
was
on
the
far
side
of
this
enormous
room
he
felt
those
strong
brown
fingers
close
over
his
wrist
oh
and
that
was
good
that
was
a
good
touch
good
to
find
desire
in
comfort
to
find
comfort
in
desire
to
find
substance
in
smoke
and
smoke
in
substance
he
tilted
his
head
back
and
looked
at
the
smokehole
so
white
and
wee
it
was
farther
up
now
miles
up
venusian
skylight
it
was
happening
he
began
to
float
come
on
then
he
thought
and
began
to
rise
faster
through
the
smoke
the
fog
the
mist
whatever
it
was
they
weren't
inside
anymore
the
two
of
them
were
standing
together
in
the
middle
of
the
barrens
and
it
was
nearly
dusk
it
was
the
barrens
he
knew
that
but
everything
was
different
the
foliage
was
lusher
deeper
savagely
fragrant
there
were
plants
he
had
never
seen
before
and
richie
realized
some
of
the
things
he
had
first
taken
for
trees
were
really
gant
ferns
there
was
the
sound
of
running
water
but
it
was
much
louder
than
it
should
have
been
this
water
sounded
not
like
the
leisurely
flow
of
the
kenduskeag
stream
but
more
the
way
he
imagined
the
colorado
river
would
sound
as
it
cut
its
way
through
the
grand
canyon
it
was
hot
too
not
that
it
didn't
get
hot
in
maine
during
the
summer
and
humid
enough
so
that
sometimes
you
felt
sticky
just
lying
in
your
bed
at
night
but
this
was
more
heat
and
more
humidity
than
he
had
ever
felt
in
his
whole
life
a
low
mist
smoky
and
thick
lay
in
the
hollows
of
the
land
and
crept
around
the
boys
legs
it
had
a
thin
acrid
smell
like
burning
green
wood
he
and
mike
began
to
move
toward
the
sound
of
the
running
water
without
speaking
pushing
their
way
through
the
strange
foliage
thick
ropy
lianas
lay
between
some
of
the
trees
like
spidery
hammocks
and
once
richie
heard
something
go
crashing
off
through
the
underbrush
it
sounded
bigger
than
a
deer
he
stopped
long
enough
to
look
around
turning
in
acircle
studying
the
horizon
he
knew
where
the
standpipe’s
thick
white
cylinder
should
have
been
but
it
wasn't
there
neither
was
the
railroad
trestle
going
over
to
the
trainyards
at
the
end
of
neibolt
street
or
the
old
cape
housing
development
low
bluffs
and
red
sandstone
outcroppings
of
rock
bulged
out
of
thick
stands
of
giant
fern
and
pine
trees
where
the
old
cape
should
have
been
there
was
a
flapping
noise
overhead
the
boys
ducked
as
a
squadron
of
bats
flapped
by
they
were
the
biggest
bats
rchie
had
ever
seen
and
for
a
moment
he
was
more
terrified
than
he
had
been
even
when
bill
was
trying
to
get
silver
rolling
and
he
had
heard
the
werewolf
closing
in
on
them
from
behind
the
stillness
and
the
alienness
of
this
land
were
both
terrible
but
its
awful
familiarity
was
somehow
worse
no
need
to
be
scared
he
told
himself
remember
that
this
is
just
a
dream
or
a
vision
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
me
and
ole
mikey
are
really
back
in
the
clubhouse
goofed
up
on
smoke
pretty
soon
big
bill
is
gonna
get
noivous
from
the
soivice
because
we're
not
answering
anymore
and
he
and
ben
will
come
down
and
haul
us
out
it
just
like
conway
twitty
says
only
makebelieve
but
he
could
see
how
one
of
the
bat
wings
was
so
ragged
the
hazy
sun
shone
through
it
and
when
they
passed
beneath
one
of
the
giant
ferns
he
could
see
a
fat
yellow
caterpillar
trundling
across
a
wide
green
frond
leaving
its
shadow
behind
it
there
were
tiny
black
mites
jumping
and
sizzling
on
the
caterpillar
body
if
this
was
a
dream
it
was
the
clearest
one
he
had
ever
had
they
went
on
toward
the
sound
of
the
water
and
in
the
thick
kneehigh
groundmist
richie
was
unable
to
tell
if
his
feet
were
touching
the
ground
or
not
they
came
to
a
place
where
both
the
mist
and
the
ground
stopped
richie
looked
unbelieving
this
was
not
the
kenduskeag
and
yet
it
was
the
stream
boiled
and
roiled
through
a
narrow
watercourse
cut
through
that
same
crumbly
rock
looking
across
to
the
far
side
he
could
see
ages
cut
into
those
stacked
layers
of
stone
red
and
then
orange
and
then
red
again
you
couldn't
walk
across
this
stream
on
steppingstones
you'd
need
a
rope
bridge
and
if
you
fell
in
you
would
be
swept
away
at
once
the
sound
of
the
water
was
the
sound
of
bitter
foolish
ager
and
as
richie
watched
slackjawed
he
saw
a
pinkishsilver
fish
jump
in
an
impossibly
high
arc
snapping
at
the
bugs
that
made
shifting
clouds
just
above
the
surface
of
the
water
it
splashed
down
again
giving
richie
just
time
enough
to
register
its
presence
and
to
realize
he
had
never
seen
a
fish
exactly
like
that
in
his
whole
life
not
even
in
a
book
birds
flocked
across
the
sky
squalling
harshly
not
a
dozen
or
two
dozen
for
a
moment
the
sky
was
so
dark
with
birds
that
they
blotted
out
the
sun
something
else
crashed
through
the
bushes
and
then
more
things
richie
wheeled
his
heart
thudding
painfully
in
his
chest
and
saw
something
that
looked
like
an
antelope
flash
by
heading
southeast
something
going
to
happen
and
they
know
it
the
birds
passed
presumably
alighting
somewhere
en
masse
farther
south
another
animal
crashed
by
them
and
another
then
there
was
silence
except
for
the
steady
rumble
of
the
kenduskeag
the
silence
had
a
waiting
quality
about
it
a
pregnant
quality
richie
didn't
like
he
felt
the
hairs
shifting
and
trying
to
stand
up
on
the
back
of
his
neck
and
he
groped
for
mike
hand
again
do
you
know
where
we
are
he
shouted
at
mike
you
got
the
word
jesus
yes
mike
shouted
back
j
got
it
this
is
ago
richie
ago
richie
nodded
ago
as
in
once
upon
a
time
long
long
ago
when
we
all
lived
in
the
forest
and
nobody
lived
anywhere
else
they
were
in
the
barrens
as
they
had
been
god
knew
how
many
thousands
of
years
ago
they
were
in
some
unimaginable
past
before
the
ice
age
when
new
england
had
been
as
tropical
as
south
america
was
today
if
there
still
was
a
today
he
looked
around
again
nervously
almost
expecting
to
see
a
brontosaurus
raise
its
cranelike
neck
against
the
sky
and
stare
down
at
them
its
mouth
full
of
mud
and
dripping
uprooted
plants
or
a
saber
toothed
tiger
come
stalking
out
of
the
undergrowth
but
there
was
only
that
silence
as
in
the
five
or
ten
minutes
before
a
vicious
thundersquall
strikes
when
the
purple
heads
stack
up
and
up
in
the
sky
overhead
and
the
light
turns
a
queer
bruised
purpleyellow
and
the
wind
dies
completely
and
you
can
smell
a
thick
aroma
like
overcharged
car
batteries
in
the
air
we're
in
the
ago
a
million
years
back
maybe
or
ten
million
or
eighty
million
but
here
we
are
and
something
going
to
happen
i
don't
know
what
but
something
and
i'm
scared
i
want
it
to
end
i
want
to
be
back
and
bill
please
bill
please
pull
us
out
it
like
we
fell
into
the
picture
some
picture
please
please
help
mike
hand
tightened
on
his
and
he
realized
that
now
the
silence
had
been
broken
there
was
a
steady
low
vibration
he
could
feel
it
more
than
hear
it
working
against
the
tight
flesh
of
his
eardrums
buzzing
the
tiny
bones
that
conducted
the
sound
it
grew
steadily
it
had
no
tone
it
simply
was
the
word
in
the
beginning
was
the
word
the
world
the
a
tuneless
soulless
sound
he
groped
for
the
tree
they
stood
near
and
as
his
hand
touched
it
cupped
the
curve
of
the
bole
he
could
feel
the
vibration
caught
inside
at
the
same
moment
he
realized
he
could
feel
it
in
his
feet
a
steady
tingling
that
went
up
his
ankles
and
calves
to
his
knees
turning
his
tendons
into
tuning
forks
it
grew
and
grew
it
was
coming
out
of
the
sky
not
wanting
to
but
unable
to
help
himself
richie
turned
his
face
up
the
sun
was
a
molten
coin
burning
a
circle
in
the
lowhanging
overcast
surrounded
by
a
fairyring
of
moisture
below
it
the
verdant
green
slash
that
was
the
barrens
lay
utterly
still
richie
thought
he
understood
what
this
vision
was
they
were
about
to
see
the
coming
of
it
the
vibration
took
on
a
voice
a
rumbling
roar
that
built
to
a
shattering
crescendo
of
sound
he
clapped
his
hands
to
his
ears
and
screamed
and
could
not
hear
himself
scream
beside
him
mike
hanlon
was
doing
the
same
and
richie
saw
that
mike
nose
was
bleeding
alittle
the
clouds
in
the
west
lit
with
a
bloom
of
red
fire
it
traced
its
way
toward
them
widening
from
an
artery
to
a
stream
to
a
river
of
ominous
color
and
then
as
a
burning
falling
object
broke
through
the
cloud
cover
the
wind
came
it
was
hot
and
searing
smoky
and
suffocating
the
thing
in
the
sky
was
gigantic
a
flaming
matchhead
that
was
nearly
too
bright
to
look
at
arcs
of
electricity
bolted
from
it
blue
bullwhips
that
flashed
out
from
it
and
left
thunder
in
their
wake
a
spaceship
richie
screamed
falling
to
his
knees
and
covering
his
eyes
oh
my
god
it
a
spaceship
but
he
believed
and
would
tell
the
others
later
as
best
he
could
that
it
was
not
a
spaceship
although
it
might
have
come
through
space
to
get
here
whatever
came
down
on
that
longago
day
had
come
from
a
place
much
farther
away
than
another
star
or
another
galaxy
and
if
spaceship
was
the
first
word
to
come
into
his
mind
perhaps
that
was
only
because
his
mind
had
no
other
way
of
grasping
what
his
eyes
were
seeing
there
was
an
explosion
then
a
roar
of
sound
followed
by
a
rolling
concussion
that
knocked
them
both
down
this
time
it
was
mike
who
groped
for
nchie
hand
there
was
another
explosion
richie
opened
his
eyes
and
saw
a
glare
of
fire
and
a
pillar
of
smoke
rising
into
the
sky
it
he
screamed
at
mike
in
an
ecstasy
of
terror
now
never
in
his
life
before
or
after
would
he
feel
any
emotion
so
deeply
be
so
overwhelmed
by
feeling
jt
it
it
mike
dragged
him
to
his
feet
and
they
ran
along
the
high
bank
of
the
young
kenduskeag
never
noticing
how
close
they
were
to
the
drop
once
mike
stumbled
and
went
skidding
to
his
knees
then
it
was
richie
turn
to
go
down
barking
his
shin
and
tearing
his
pants
the
wind
had
come
up
and
it
was
pushing
the
smell
of
the
burning
forest
toward
them
the
smoke
grew
thicker
and
richie
became
dimly
aware
that
he
and
mike
were
not
running
alone
the
animals
were
on
the
move
again
fleeing
from
the
smoke
the
fire
the
death
in
the
fire
running
from
it
perhaps
the
new
arrival
in
their
world
richie
began
to
cough
he
could
hear
mike
beside
him
also
coughing
the
smoke
was
thicker
washing
out
the
greens
and
grays
and
reds
of
the
day
mike
fell
again
and
richie
lost
his
hand
he
groped
for
it
and
could
not
find
it
mike
he
screamed
panicked
coughing
mike
where
are
you
mike
mike
but
mike
was
gone
mike
was
nowhere
richie
richie
riche
whacko
richie
richie
richie
are
you
all
right
his
eyes
fluttered
open
and
he
saw
beverly
kneeling
beside
him
wiping
his
mouth
with
a
handkerchief
the
others
bill
eddie
stan
and
ben
stood
behind
her
their
faces
solemn
and
scared
the
side
of
richie
face
hurt
like
hell
he
tried
to
speak
to
beverly
and
could
only
croak
he
tried
to
clear
his
throat
and
almost
vomited
his
throat
and
lungs
felt
as
if
they
had
somehow
been
lined
with
smoke
at
last
he
managed
did
you
slap
me
beverly
lit
was
all
i
could
think
of
to
do
she
said
whack
richie
muttered
i
didn't
think
you
were
going
to
be
all
right
is
all
bev
said
and
suddenly
burst
into
tears
richie
patted
her
clumsily
on
the
shoulder
and
bill
put
a
hand
on
the
back
of
her
neck
she
reached
around
at
once
took
it
squeezed
it
richie
managed
to
sit
up
the
world
began
to
swim
in
waves
when
it
steadied
down
he
saw
mike
leaning
against
a
tree
nearby
his
face
dazed
and
ashypale
did
i
puke
richie
asked
bev
she
nodded
still
crying
in
a
croaking
stumbling
irish
cop
voice
he
asked
get
any
on
ye
darlin
bev
laughed
through
her
tears
and
shook
her
head
i
turned
you
on
your
side
i
was
afraid
aaafraid
you'd
chchchoke
on
it
she
began
to
cry
hard
again
nuhnuhno
ffair
bill
said
still
holding
her
hand
ii'm
the
one
who
stuhhuhhutters
a
around
there
not
bad
big
bill
richie
said
he
tried
to
get
to
his
feet
and
sat
down
again
heavily
the
world
was
still
swimming
he
began
to
cough
and
turned
his
head
away
aware
that
he
was
going
to
retch
again
only
a
moment
before
it
happened
he
threw
up
a
mess
of
green
foam
and
thick
saliva
that
mostly
came
out
in
ropes
he
closed
his
eyes
tight
and
croaked
anyone
want
a
snack
oh
shit
ben
cried
disgusted
and
laughing
at
the
same
time
looks
more
like
puke
to
me
richie
said
although
in
truth
his
eyes
were
still
tightly
shut
the
shit
usually
comes
out
the
other
end
at
least
for
me
i
dunno
about
you
haystack
when
he
opened
his
eyes
at
last
he
saw
the
clubhouse
about
twenty
yards
away
both
the
window
and
the
big
trapdoor
were
thrown
open
smoke
thinning
now
puffed
from
both
this
time
richie
was
able
to
get
to
his
feet
for
a
moment
he
was
quite
sure
he
was
going
to
retch
again
or
faint
or
both
whacko
he
murmured
watching
the
world
waver
and
warp
in
front
of
his
eyes
when
the
feeling
passed
he
made
his
way
over
to
where
mike
was
mike
eyes
were
still
weaselred
and
from
the
dampness
on
his
pants
cuffs
richie
thought
that
maybe
ole
mikey
had
taken
a
ride
on
the
stomach
elevator
too
for
a
white
boy
you
did
pretty
good
mike
croaked
and
punched
richie
weakly
on
the
shoulder
richie
was
at
a
loss
for
words
a
condition
of
exquisite
rarity
bill
came
over
the
others
came
with
him
you
pulled
us
out
richie
asked
mme
and
buhben
yyou
were
scuhscuhrheaming
bboth
of
yyyou
bbbut
he
looked
over
at
ben
ben
said
it
must
have
been
the
smoke
bill
but
there
was
no
conviction
in
the
big
boy
voice
at
all
flatly
richie
said
you
mean
what
i
think
you
mean
bill
shrugged
w
wwhat
ththat
rih
richie
mike
answered
we
weren't
there
at
first
were
we
you
went
down
because
you
heard
us
screaming
but
at
first
we
weren't
there
tt
was
really
smoky
ben
said
hearing
you
both
screaming
that
way
that
was
scary
enough
but
the
screaming
it
sounded
well
it
sssounded
very
ffffar
aaway
bill
said
stuttering
badly
he
told
them
that
when
he
and
ben
had
gone
down
they
hadn't
been
able
to
see
either
richie
or
mike
they
had
gone
plunging
around
in
the
smoky
clubhouse
panicked
scared
that
if
they
didn't
act
quickly
the
two
boys
might
die
of
smoke
poisoning
at
last
bill
had
gripped
a
hand
richie
he
had
given
a
huhhuhhell
of
a
yuhyan
and
richie
had
come
flying
out
of
the
gloom
only
about
onequarter
conscious
when
bill
turned
around
he
had
seen
ben
with
mike
in
a
bearhug
both
of
them
coughing
ben
had
thrown
mike
up
and
out
through
the
trapdoor
ben
listened
to
all
this
nodding
kept
grabbing
you
know
really
not
doing
anything
except
jabbing
my
hand
out
like
i
wanted
to
shake
hands
you
grabbed
it
mike
damn
good
thing
you
grabbed
it
when
you
did
i
think
you
were
just
about
gone
you
guys
make
the
clubhouse
sound
a
lot
bigger
than
it
is
richie
said
talking
about
stumbling
around
in
it
and
all
it
only
five
feet
on
every
side
there
was
a
moment
silence
while
they
all
looked
at
bill
who
stood
in
frowning
concentration
it
wwwas
bbigge
he
said
at
last
w
wwasn't
it
ben
ben
shrugged
it
sure
seemed
like
it
unless
it
was
the
smoke
it
wasn't
the
smoke
richie
said
just
before
it
happened
before
we
went
out
i
remember
thinking
it
was
at
least
as
big
as
a
ballroom
in
a
movie
like
one
of
those
musicals
seven
brides
for
seven
brothers
something
like
that
i
could
barely
see
mike
against
the
other
wall
before
you
went
ou
beverly
asked
well
what
i
mean
like
she
grabbed
richie
arm
it
happened
didn't
it
it
really
happened
you
had
a
vision
just
like
in
ben
book
her
face
was
glowing
it
really
happened
richie
looked
down
at
himself
and
then
at
mike
one
of
the
knees
of
mike
corduroy
pants
was
out
and
both
the
knees
of
his
own
jeans
were
torn
he
could
look
through
the
holes
and
see
bleeding
scrapes
on
both
his
knees
if
it
was
a
vision
i
never
want
to
have
another
on
he
said
i
don't
know
about
de
kingfish
over
there
but
when
i
went
down
there
i
didn't
have
any
holes
in
my
pants
they're
practically
new
for
gosh
sakes
my
mom
gonna
give
me
hell
what
happened
ben
and
eddie
asked
together
richie
and
mike
exchanged
a
glance
and
then
richie
said
bevvie
you
got
a
smoke
she
had
two
wrapped
in
a
piece
of
tissue
richie
put
one
of
them
in
his
mouth
and
when
she
lit
it
the
first
drag
made
him
cough
s
badly
that
he
handed
it
back
to
her
can't
he
said
sorry
it
was
the
past
mike
said
shit
on
that
richie
said
it
wasn't
just
the
past
it
was
ago
yeah
right
we
were
in
the
barrens
but
the
kenduskeag
was
going
a
mile
a
minute
it
was
deep
it
was
fuckin
wild
sorry
bevvie
but
it
was
and
there
were
fish
in
it
salmon
i
think
mmy
dddad
ssays
th
there
haven't
been
aaany
fuhfish
in
the
k
kenduskkkeag
for
a
lhlong
tuhhime
bbecause
of
the
suhsewage
this
was
a
long
time
all
right
richie
said
he
looked
around
at
them
uncertainly
i
think
it
was
a
million
years
ago
at
least
a
thunderstruck
silence
greeted
this
beverly
broke
it
at
last
but
what
happened
'
richie
felt
the
words
in
his
throat
but
he
had
to
struggle
to
bring
them
out
it
felt
almost
like
vomiting
again
we
saw
it
come
he
said
at
last
i
think
that
was
it
christ
stan
muttered
oh
christ
there
was
a
sharp
hiss
gasp
as
eddie
used
his
aspirator
it
came
out
of
the
sky
mike
said
i
never
want
to
see
anything
like
that
again
in
my
whole
life
it
was
burning
so
hot
you
couldn't
really
look
at
it
and
it
was
thowin
off
electricity
and
makin
thunder
the
noise
he
shook
his
head
and
looked
at
richie
it
sounded
like
the
end
of
the
world
and
when
it
hit
it
started
a
forest
fire
that
was
at
the
end
of
it
was
it
a
spaceship
ben
asked
ye
richie
said
n
mike
said
they
looked
at
each
other
well
i
guess
it
was
mike
said
and
at
the
same
time
richie
said
no
it
really
wasn't
a
spaceship
you
know
but
they
paused
again
while
the
others
looked
at
them
perplexed
you
tell
richie
said
to
mike
we
mean
the
same
thing
i
think
but
they're
not
getting
it
mike
coughed
into
his
fist
and
then
looked
up
at
the
others
almost
apologetically
i
don't
know
just
how
to
tell
yo
he
said
tttr
bill
said
urgently
tt
came
out
of
the
sky
mike
repeated
but
it
wasn't
a
spaceship
exactly
it
wasn't
a
meteor
either
it
was
more
like
well
like
the
ark
of
the
covenant
in
the
bible
that
was
supposed
to
have
the
spirit
of
god
inside
of
it
except
this
wasn't
god
just
feeling
it
watching
it
come
you
knew
it
meant
bad
that
it
was
bad
he
looked
at
them
richie
nodded
it
came
from
outside
i
got
that
feeling
from
outside
outside
where
richie
eddie
asked
outside
everything
richie
said
and
when
it
came
down
it
made
the
biggest
damn
hole
you
ever
saw
in
your
life
it
turned
this
big
hill
into
a
doughnut
just
about
it
landed
right
where
the
downtown
part
of
derry
is
now
he
looked
at
them
do
you
get
it
beverly
dropped
the
cigarette
halfsmoked
and
crushed
it
out
under
one
shoe
mike
said
it
always
been
here
since
the
beginning
of
time
since
before
there
were
men
anywhere
unless
maybe
there
were
just
a
few
of
them
in
africa
somewhere
swinging
through
the
trees
or
living
in
caves
the
crater
gone
now
and
he
ice
age
probably
scraped
the
valley
deeper
and
changed
some
stuff
around
and
filled
the
crater
in
but
it
was
here
then
sleeping
maybe
waiting
for
the
ice
to
melt
waiting
for
the
people
to
come
that
why
it
uses
the
sewers
and
the
drains
richie
put
in
they
must
be
regular
freeways
for
it
you
didn't
see
what
it
looked
like
stan
uris
asked
abruptly
and
a
little
hoarsely
they
shook
their
heads
can
we
beat
i
eddie
said
in
the
silence
a
thing
like
that
no
one
answered
chapter
eddie
bad
break
by
the
time
richie
finishes
they're
all
nodding
eddie
is
nodding
along
with
them
remembering
along
with
them
when
the
pain
suddenly
races
up
his
left
arm
races
up
no
rips
through
it
feels
as
if
someone
is
trying
to
sharpen
a
rusty
saw
on
the
bone
in
there
he
grimaces
and
reaches
into
the
pocket
of
his
sport
jacket
sorts
through
a
number
of
bottles
by
feel
and
takes
out
the
excedrin
he
swallows
two
with
a
gulp
of
ginandprune
juice
the
arm
has
been
paining
him
off
and
on
all
day
at
first
he
dismissed
it
as
the
twinges
of
bursitis
he
sometimes
gets
when
the
weather
is
damp
but
halfway
through
richie
story
a
new
memory
clicks
into
place
for
him
and
he
understands
the
pain
this
isn't
memory
lane
we're
wandering
down
anymore
he
thinks
it
getting
more
and
more
like
the
long
island
expressway
five
years
ago
during
a
routine
checkup
eddie
has
a
routine
check
up
every
six
weeks
the
doctor
said
matteroffactly
there
an
old
break
here
ed
did
you
fall
out
of
a
tree
when
you
were
a
ki
something
like
tha
eddie
agreed
not
bothering
to
tell
dr
robbins
that
his
mother
undoubtedly
would
have
fallen
down
dead
of
a
brain
hemorrhage
if
she
had
seen
or
heard
of
her
eddie
climbing
trees
the
truth
was
he
hadn't
been
able
to
remember
exactly
how
he
broke
the
arm
it
didn't
seem
important
although
eddie
thinks
now
that
lack
of
interest
was
in
itself
very
odd
he
is
after
all
a
man
who
attaches
importance
to
a
sneeze
or
a
slight
change
in
the
color
of
his
stools
but
it
was
an
old
break
a
minor
irritation
something
that
happened
a
long
time
ago
in
a
boyhood
he
could
barely
remember
and
didn't
care
to
recall
it
pained
him
a
little
when
he
had
to
drive
long
hours
on
rainy
days
a
couple
of
aspirin
took
care
of
it
nicely
no
big
deal
but
now
it
is
not
just
a
minor
irritation
it
is
some
madman
sharpening
that
rusty
saw
playing
bonetunes
and
he
remembers
that
was
how
it
felt
in
the
hospital
especially
late
at
night
in
the
first
three
or
four
days
after
it
happened
lying
there
in
bed
sweating
in
the
summer
heat
waiting
for
the
nurse
to
bring
him
a
pill
tears
running
silently
down
his
cheeks
into
the
bowls
of
his
ears
thinking
it
like
some
kook
sharpening
a
saw
in
there
if
this
is
memory
lane
eddie
thinks
i'd
trade
it
for
one
great
big
brain
enema
a
mental
high
colonic
unaware
he
is
going
to
speak
he
says
it
was
henry
bowers
who
broke
my
arm
do
you
remember
tha
mike
nods
that
was
just
before
patrick
hockstetter
disappeared
i
don't
remember
the
date
d
eddie
says
flatly
tt
was
the
th
of
july
the
hockstetter
kid
was
reported
missing
on
what
the
twentysecon
beverly
rogan
says
although
she
doesn't
tell
them
why
she
is
so
sure
of
the
date
it
is
because
she
saw
it
take
hockstetter
nor
does
she
tell
them
that
she
believed
then
and
believes
now
that
patrick
hockstetter
was
crazy
perhaps
even
crazier
than
henry
bowers
she
will
tell
them
but
this
is
eddie
turn
she
will
speak
next
and
then
she
supposes
that
ben
will
narrate
the
climax
of
that
july
events
the
silver
bullet
they
had
never
quite
dared
to
make
a
nightmare
agenda
if
ever
there
was
one
she
thinks
but
that
crazy
exhilaration
persists
when
did
she
last
feel
this
young
she
can
hardly
sit
still
the
th
of
jul
eddie
muses
rolling
his
aspirator
along
the
table
from
one
hand
to
the
other
three
or
four
days
after
the
smokehole
thing
i
spent
the
rest
of
the
summer
in
a
cast
remembe
richie
slaps
his
forehead
in
a
gesture
they
all
remember
from
the
old
days
and
bill
thinks
with
a
mixture
of
amusement
and
unease
that
for
a
moment
there
richie
looked
just
like
beaver
cleaver
sure
of
course
you
were
in
a
cast
when
we
went
to
the
house
on
neibolt
street
weren't
you
and
later
in
the
dark
but
now
richie
shakes
his
head
a
little
puzzled
what
rrichie
'
bill
asks
can't
remember
that
part
ye
richie
admits
can
yo
bill
shakes
his
head
slowly
hockstetter
was
with
them
that
da
eddie
says
it
was
the
last
time
i
ever
saw
him
alive
maybe
he
was
a
replacement
for
peter
gordon
i
guess
bowers
didn't
want
peter
around
anymore
after
he
ran
the
day
of
the
rockfight
they
all
died
didn't
the
beverly
asks
quietly
after
jimmy
cullum
the
only
ones
who
died
were
henry
bowers
friends
or
his
exfriends
all
but
bowers
mike
agrees
glancing
toward
the
balloons
tethered
to
the
microfilm
recorder
and
he
in
juniper
hill
a
private
insane
asylum
in
augusta
bill
says
wwwhat
about
when
they
broke
your
arm
eeeddie
'
your
stutter
getting
worse
big
bill
eddie
says
solemnly
and
finishes
his
drink
in
one
gulp
never
mind
tha
bill
says
ttell
us
tell
us
beverly
repeats
and
puts
her
hand
lightly
on
his
arm
the
pain
flares
there
again
all
right
eddie
says
he
pours
himself
a
fresh
drink
studies
it
and
says
it
was
a
couple
of
days
after
i
came
home
from
the
hospital
that
you
guys
came
over
to
the
house
and
showed
me
those
silver
ballbearings
you
remember
bil
bill
nods
eddie
looks
at
beverly
bill
asked
you
if
you'd
shoot
them
if
it
came
to
that
because
you
had
the
best
eye
i
think
you
said
you
wouldn't
that
you'd
be
too
afraid
and
you
told
us
something
else
but
i
just
can't
remember
what
it
was
it
like
eddie
sticks
his
tongue
out
and
plucks
the
end
of
it
as
if
something
were
stuck
there
richie
and
ben
both
grin
was
it
something
about
hockstetter
'
ye
beverly
says
t'll
tell
when
you're
done
go
ahead
tt
was
after
that
after
all
you
guys
left
that
my
mother
came
in
and
we
had
a
big
fight
she
didn't
want
me
to
hang
around
with
any
of
you
guys
again
and
she
might
have
gotten
me
to
agree
she
had
a
way
a
way
of
working
on
a
guy
you
know
bill
nods
again
he
remembers
mrs
kaspbrak
a
huge
woman
with
a
strange
schizophrenic
face
a
face
capable
of
looking
stony
and
furious
and
miserable
and
frightened
all
at
the
same
time
yeah
she
might
have
gotten
me
to
agree
eddie
says
but
something
else
happened
the
same
day
bowers
broke
my
arm
something
that
really
shook
me
up
he
utters
a
little
laugh
thinking
it
shook
me
up
all
right
is
that
all
you
can
say
what
good
talking
when
you
can
never
tell
people
how
you
really
feel
in
a
book
or
a
movie
what
i
found
out
that
day
before
bowers
broke
my
arm
would
have
changed
my
life
forever
and
nothing
would
have
happened
the
way
it
did
in
a
book
or
a
movie
it
would
have
set
me
free
in
a
book
or
a
movie
i
wouldn't
have
a
whole
suitcase
full
of
pills
back
in
my
room
at
the
town
house
i
wouldn't
be
married
to
myra
i
wouldn't
have
this
stupid
fucking
aspirator
here
right
now
in
a
book
or
a
movie
because
suddenly
as
they
all
watch
eddie
aspirator
rolls
across
the
table
by
itself
as
it
rolls
it
makes
a
dry
rattling
sound
a
little
like
maracas
a
little
like
bones
a
little
like
laughter
as
it
reaches
the
far
side
between
richie
and
ben
it
flips
itself
up
into
the
air
and
falls
on
the
floor
richie
makes
a
startled
halfgrab
and
bill
cries
sharply
don't
tttouch
i
the
balloons
ben
yells
and
they
all
turn
both
balloons
tethered
to
the
microfilm
recorder
now
read
asthma
medicine
gives
you
cancer
below
the
slogan
are
grinning
skulls
they
explode
with
twin
bangs
eddie
looks
at
this
mouth
dry
the
familiar
sensation
of
suffocation
starting
to
tighten
down
in
his
chest
like
locking
bolts
bill
looks
back
at
him
who
ttold
you
and
wwwhat
did
they
tell
yo
eddie
licks
his
lips
wanting
to
go
after
his
aspirator
not
quite
daring
to
who
knew
what
might
be
in
itnow
he
thinks
about
that
day
the
th
about
how
it
was
hot
abouthow
his
mother
gave
him
a
check
all
filled
out
except
for
the
amount
and
a
dollar
in
cash
for
himself
his
allowance
mr
keene
he
says
and
his
voice
sounds
distant
to
his
own
ears
without
power
it
was
mr
keene
not
exactly
the
nicest
man
in
derr
mike
says
but
eddie
lost
in
his
thoughts
barely
hears
him
yes
it
was
hot
that
day
but
cool
inside
the
center
street
drug
the
wooden
fans
turning
leisurely
below
the
pressedtin
ceiling
and
there
was
that
comforting
smell
of
mixed
powders
and
nostrums
this
was
the
place
where
they
sold
health
that
was
his
mother
unstated
but
clearly
communicated
conviction
and
with
his
bodyclock
set
at
halfpast
eleven
eddie
had
no
suspicion
that
his
mother
might
be
wrong
about
that
or
anything
else
well
mr
keene
sure
put
an
end
to
that
he
thinks
now
with
a
kind
of
sweet
anger
he
remembers
standing
at
the
comic
rack
for
awhile
spinning
it
idly
to
see
if
there
were
any
new
batmans
or
superboys
or
his
own
favorite
plastic
man
he
had
given
his
mother
list
she
sent
him
to
the
drugstore
as
other
boy
mothers
might
send
them
to
the
comer
grocery
and
his
mother
check
to
mr
keene
he
would
fill
the
order
and
then
write
in
the
amount
on
the
check
giving
eddie
the
receipt
so
she
ould
deduct
the
amount
from
her
checking
balance
this
was
all
sop
for
eddie
three
different
kinds
of
prescription
for
his
mother
plus
a
bottle
of
geritol
because
she
told
him
mysteriously
it
full
of
iron
eddie
and
women
need
more
iron
than
men
also
there
would
be
his
vitamins
a
bottle
of
dr
swett
elixir
for
children
and
of
course
his
asthma
medicine
it
was
always
the
same
later
he
would
stop
in
the
costello
avenue
market
with
his
dollar
and
get
two
candybars
and
a
pepsi
he
would
eat
the
candy
drink
the
soda
and
jingle
his
pocketchange
all
the
way
home
but
this
day
was
different
it
would
end
with
him
in
the
hospital
and
that
was
certainly
different
but
it
started
being
different
when
mr
keene
called
him
because
instead
of
handing
him
the
big
white
bag
full
of
cures
and
the
receipt
admonishing
him
to
put
the
receipt
in
his
pocket
so
he
wouldn't
lose
it
mr
keene
looked
at
him
thoughtfully
and
said
come
back
into
the
office
for
a
minute
eddie
i
want
to
talk
to
you
eddie
only
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
bunking
a
little
scared
the
idea
that
maybe
mr
keene
thought
he
had
been
shoplifting
flashed
briefly
through
his
mind
there
was
that
sign
by
the
door
that
he
always
read
when
he
came
into
the
center
street
drug
it
was
written
in
accusing
black
letters
so
large
that
he
bet
even
richie
tozier
could
read
it
without
his
glasses
shoplifting
is
not
a
kick
or
a
groov
or
a
gasse
shoplifting
is
a
crime
and
we
will
prosecute
eddie
had
never
shoplifted
anything
in
his
life
but
that
sign
always
made
him
feel
guilty
made
him
feel
as
if
mr
keene
knew
something
about
him
that
he
didn't
know
about
himself
then
mr
keene
confused
him
even
further
by
saying
how
about
an
icecream
soda
well
oh
it
on
the
house
i
always
have
one
in
the
office
around
this
time
of
day
good
energy
unless
you
need
to
watch
your
weight
and
i'd
say
neither
of
us
do
my
wife
says
i
look
like
stuffed
string
your
friend
there
the
hanscom
boy
he
the
one
who
needs
to
have
a
care
about
his
weight
what
flavor
eddie
well
my
mother
said
to
get
home
as
soon
as
i
you
look
like
a
chocolate
man
to
me
chocolate
okay
for
you
mr
keene
eyes
twinkled
but
it
was
a
dry
twinkle
like
the
sun
shining
on
mica
in
the
desert
or
so
eddie
a
fan
of
such
western
writers
as
max
brand
and
archie
joceylen
thought
sure
eddie
gave
in
something
about
the
way
mr
keene
pushed
his
goldrimmed
glasses
up
on
his
blade
of
a
nose
made
him
edgy
something
about
the
way
mr
keene
seemed
both
nervous
and
secretly
pleased
he
didn't
want
to
go
into
the
office
with
mr
keene
this
wasn't
about
a
soda
nope
and
whatever
it
was
about
eddie
had
an
idea
it
wasn't
such
great
news
maybe
he
going
to
tell
me
i
got
cancer
or
something
eddie
thought
wildly
that
kid
cancer
leukemia
jesus
oh
don't
be
so
stupid
he
answered
himself
back
trying
to
sound
in
his
own
mind
like
stuttering
bill
stuttering
bill
had
replaced
jock
mahoney
who
played
the
range
rider
on
tv
saturday
mornings
as
the
great
hero
of
eddie
life
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
couldn't
talk
right
big
bill
always
seemed
to
be
on
top
of
things
this
guy
a
pharmacist
not
a
doctor
for
cripe
sake
but
eddie
was
still
nervous
mr
keene
had
raised
the
countergate
and
was
beckoning
to
eddie
with
one
bony
finger
eddie
went
but
reluctantly
ruby
the
countergirl
was
sitting
by
the
cash
register
and
reading
a
silver
screen
would
you
make
two
icecream
sodas
rub
mr
keene
called
to
her
one
chocolate
one
coffee
sure
ruby
said
marking
her
place
in
the
magazine
with
a
tinfoil
gum
wrapper
and
getting
up
bring
them
into
the
office
sure
come
on
son
i'm
not
going
to
bite
you
and
mr
keene
actually
winked
astounding
eddie
completely
he
had
never
been
in
back
of
the
counter
before
and
he
gazed
at
all
the
bottles
and
pills
and
jars
with
interest
he
would
have
lingered
if
he
had
been
on
his
own
examining
mr
keene
mortar
and
pestle
his
scales
and
weghts
the
fishbowls
full
of
capsules
but
mr
keene
propelled
him
forward
into
the
office
and
closed
the
door
firmly
behind
him
when
it
clicked
shut
eddie
felt
a
warning
tightness
in
his
chest
and
fought
it
there
would
be
a
fresh
aspirator
in
with
his
mother
things
and
he
could
have
a
long
satisfying
honk
on
it
as
soon
as
he
was
out
of
here
a
bottle
of
licorice
whips
stood
on
the
corner
of
mr
keene
desk
he
offered
it
to
eddie
no
thank
you
eddie
said
politely
mr
keene
sat
down
in
the
swivel
chair
behind
his
desk
and
took
one
then
he
opened
his
drawer
and
took
something
out
he
put
it
down
next
to
the
tall
bottle
of
licorice
whips
and
eddie
felt
real
alarm
course
through
him
it
was
an
aspirator
mr
keene
tilted
back
in
his
swivel
chair
until
his
head
was
almost
touching
the
calendar
on
the
wall
behind
him
the
picture
on
the
calendar
showed
more
pills
it
said
squibb
and
and
for
one
nightmare
moment
when
mr
keene
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
eddie
remembered
what
had
happened
in
the
shoe
store
when
he
was
just
a
little
kid
when
his
mother
had
screamed
at
him
for
putting
his
foot
in
the
xray
machine
for
that
one
nightmare
moment
eddie
thought
mr
keene
would
say
eddie
nine
out
of
ten
doctors
agree
that
asthma
medicine
gives
you
cancer
just
like
the
xray
machines
they
used
to
have
in
the
shoe
stores
you've
probably
got
it
already
just
thought
you
ought
to
know
but
what
mr
keene
did
say
was
so
peculiar
that
eddie
could
think
of
no
response
at
all
he
could
only
sit
in
the
straight
wooden
chair
on
the
other
side
of
mr
keene
desk
like
a
nit
this
has
gone
on
long
enough
eddie
opened
his
mouth
and
then
closed
it
again
how
old
are
you
eddie
eleven
isn't
it
yes
sir
eddie
said
faintly
his
breathing
was
indeed
shallowing
up
he
wasn't
yet
whistling
like
a
teakettle
which
was
how
richie
put
it
somebody
turn
eddie
off
he
reached
the
boil'
but
that
might
happen
at
any
time
he
looked
longingly
at
the
aspirator
on
mr
keene
desk
and
because
something
else
seemed
required
he
said
til
be
twelve
in
november
mr
keene
nodded
then
leaned
forward
like
a
tv
pharmacist
in
a
commercial
and
clasped
his
hands
together
his
eyeglasses
gleamed
in
the
strong
light
thrown
by
the
overhead
fluorescent
bars
do
you
know
what
a
placebo
is
eddie
nervously
taking
his
best
guess
eddie
said
those
are
the
things
on
cows
that
the
milk
comes
out
of
aren't
they
mr
keene
laughed
and
rocked
back
in
his
chair
n
he
said
and
eddie
blushed
to
the
roots
of
his
flattop
haircut
now
he
could
hear
the
whistle
creeping
into
his
breathing
a
placebo
he
was
interrupted
by
a
brisk
double
tap
at
the
door
without
waiting
for
a
comein
call
ruby
entered
with
an
oldfashioned
icecreamsoda
glass
in
each
hand
yours
must
be
the
chocolate
she
said
to
eddie
and
gave
him
a
grin
he
returned
it
as
best
he
could
but
his
interest
in
icecream
sodas
was
at
its
lowest
ebb
in
his
entire
personal
history
he
felt
scared
in
a
way
that
was
both
wgue
and
specific
it
was
the
way
he
felt
scared
when
he
was
sitting
on
dr
handor
examination
table
in
his
underpants
waiting
for
the
doctor
to
come
in
and
knowing
his
mother
was
out
in
the
waiting
room
taking
up
most
of
one
sofa
a
book
most
likely
norman
vincent
peak
the
power
of
positive
thinking
or
dr
jarvis
vermont
folk
medicine
held
firmly
up
to
her
eyes
like
a
hymnal
stripped
of
his
clothes
and
defenseless
he
felt
caught
between
the
two
of
them
he
sipped
some
of
his
soda
as
ruby
went
out
hardly
tasting
it
mr
keene
waited
until
the
door
was
shut
and
then
smiled
his
dry
sunonmica
smile
again
loosen
up
eddie
i'm
not
going
to
bite
you
or
hurt
you
eddie
nodded
because
mr
keene
was
a
grownup
and
you
were
supposed
to
agree
with
grownups
at
all
costs
his
mother
had
taught
him
that
but
inside
he
was
thinking
oh
i've
heard
that
bullshit
before
it
was
about
what
the
doctor
said
when
he
opened
his
sterilizer
and
the
sharp
frightening
smell
of
alcohol
drifted
out
stinging
his
nostrils
that
was
the
smell
of
shots
and
this
was
the
smell
of
bullshit
and
both
came
down
to
the
same
thing
when
they
said
it
was
just
going
to
be
a
little
prick
something
you
hardly
felt
at
all
that
meant
it
was
going
to
hurt
plenty
he
tried
another
halfhearted
suck
on
his
soda
straw
but
it
was
no
good
he
needed
all
the
space
in
his
narrowing
throat
just
to
suck
in
air
he
looked
at
the
aspirator
sitting
in
the
middle
of
mr
keene
blotter
wanted
to
ask
for
it
didn't
quite
dare
a
weird
thought
occurred
to
him
maybe
mr
keene
knew
he
wanted
it
but
didn't
dare
ask
for
it
that
maybe
mr
keene
was
torturing
teasing
him
except
that
was
a
really
stupid
idea
wasn't
it
a
grownup
particularly
a
healthdispensing
grownup
wouldn't
tease
a
little
kid
that
way
would
he
surely
not
it
wasn't
even
to
be
considered
because
consideration
of
such
an
idea
might
necessitate
a
terrifying
reappraisal
of
the
world
as
eddie
understood
it
but
there
it
was
there
it
was
so
near
and
yet
»
far
like
water
just
beyond
the
reach
of
a
man
who
was
dying
of
thirst
in
the
desert
there
it
was
standing
on
the
desk
below
mr
keene
smiling
mica
eyes
eddie
wished
more
than
anything
else
that
he
was
down
in
the
barrens
with
his
friends
around
him
the
thought
of
a
monster
some
great
monster
lurking
under
the
city
where
he
had
been
born
and
where
he
had
grown
up
using
the
sewers
and
drains
to
creep
from
place
to
place
that
was
a
frightening
thought
and
the
thought
of
actually
fighting
that
creature
of
taking
it
on
was
even
more
frightening
but
somehow
this
was
worse
how
could
you
fight
a
grownup
who
said
it
wasn't
going
to
hurt
when
you
knew
it
was
how
could
you
fight
a
grownup
who
asked
you
funny
questions
and
said
obscurely
ominous
things
like
this
has
gone
on
long
enough
and
almost
idly
in
a
kind
of
sidethought
eddie
discovered
one
of
his
childhood
great
truths
grownups
are
the
real
monsters
he
thought
it
was
no
big
deal
not
a
thought
that
came
in
a
revelatory
flash
or
announced
itself
with
trumpets
and
bells
it
just
came
and
was
gone
almost
buried
under
the
stronger
overriding
thought
j
want
my
aspirator
and
i
want
to
be
out
of
here
loosen
up
mr
keene
said
again
most
of
your
trouble
eddie
comes
from
teing
so
tight
and
stiff
all
the
time
take
your
asthma
for
instance
look
here
mr
keene
opened
his
desk
drawer
fumbled
around
inside
and
then
brought
out
a
balloon
expanding
his
narrow
chest
as
much
as
possible
his
tie
bobbed
like
a
narrow
boat
riding
a
mild
wave
he
huffed
into
it
and
blew
it
up
center
street
drug
the
balloon
said
prescriptions
sundries
ostomy
supplies
mr
keene
pinched
the
balloon
rubber
neck
and
held
the
balloon
out
in
front
of
him
now
pretend
for
just
a
moment
that
this
is
a
lung
he
said
your
lung
i
should
really
blow
up
two
of
course
but
since
i
only
had
one
left
from
the
sale
we
had
just
after
christmas
mr
keene
could
i
have
my
aspirator
now
eddie
head
was
starting
to
pound
he
could
feel
his
wndpipe
sealing
itself
up
his
heartrate
was
up
and
sweat
stood
out
on
his
forehead
his
chocolate
icecream
soda
stood
on
the
corner
of
mr
keene
desk
the
cherry
on
top
sinking
slowly
into
a
goo
of
whipped
cream
in
a
minute
mr
keene
said
pay
attention
eddie
i
want
to
help
you
it
time
somebody
did
if
russ
handor
isn't
man
enough
to
do
it
i'll
have
to
your
lung
is
like
this
balloon
except
it
surrounded
by
a
blanket
of
muscle
these
muscles
are
like
the
arms
of
a
man
operating
a
bellows
you
understand
in
a
healthy
person
those
muscles
help
the
lungs
to
expand
and
contract
easily
but
if
the
owner
of
those
healthy
lungs
is
always
getting
stiff
and
tight
the
muscles
begin
to
work
against
the
lungs
rather
than
with
them
look
mr
keene
wrapped
a
bunched
bony
liverspotted
hand
around
the
balloon
and
squeezed
the
balloon
bulged
over
and
under
his
fist
and
eddie
winced
trying
to
get
ready
for
the
pop
simultaneously
he
felt
his
breathing
stop
altogether
he
leaned
over
the
desk
and
grabbed
for
the
aspirator
on
the
blotter
his
shoulder
struck
the
heavy
icecreamsoda
glass
it
toppled
off
the
desk
and
shattered
on
the
floor
like
a
bomb
eddie
heard
that
only
dimly
he
was
clawing
the
top
off
the
aspirator
slamming
the
nozzle
into
his
mouth
triggering
it
off
he
took
a
tearing
heaving
breath
his
thoughts
a
ratrun
of
panic
as
they
always
were
at
moments
like
this
please
mommy
i'm
suffocating
i
can't
breathe
oh
my
dear
god
oh
dear
jesus
meekandmild
i
can't
breathe
phase
i
don't
want
to
die
don't
want
to
die
oh
please
then
the
fog
from
the
aspirator
condensed
on
the
swollen
walls
of
his
throat
and
he
could
breathe
again
tm
sorry
he
said
nearly
crying
i'm
sorry
about
the
glass
i'll
clean
it
up
and
pay
for
it
just
please
don't
tell
my
mother
okay
i'm
sorry
mr
keene
but
i
couldn't
breathe
there
was
that
double
tap
at
the
door
again
and
ruby
poked
her
head
in
is
everything
everything
fine
mr
keene
said
sharply
leave
us
well
i'm
sawr
ruby
said
she
rolled
her
eyes
and
closed
the
door
eddie
breath
was
starting
to
whistle
in
his
throat
again
he
took
another
pull
at
the
aspirator
and
then
began
his
fumbling
apology
once
more
he
ceased
only
when
he
saw
that
mr
keene
was
smiling
at
him
that
peculiar
dry
smile
mr
keene
hands
were
laced
over
his
middle
the
balloon
lay
on
his
desk
a
thought
came
to
eddie
he
tried
to
hold
it
back
and
couldn't
mr
keene
looked
as
if
eddie
asthma
attack
had
tasted
better
to
him
than
his
half
finished
coffee
soda
don't
be
concerned
he
said
ruby
will
clean
up
the
mess
later
and
if
you
want
to
know
the
truth
i'm
rather
glad
you
broke
the
glass
because
i
promise
not
to
tell
your
mother
that
you
broke
it
if
you
promise
not
to
tell
her
we
had
this
little
talk
oh
i
promise
tha
eddie
said
eagerly
good
mr
keene
said
we
have
an
understanding
and
you
feel
much
better
now
don't
you
eddie
nodded
why
why
well
because
i
had
my
medicne
he
looked
at
mr
keene
the
way
he
looked
at
mrs
casey
in
school
when
he
had
given
an
answer
he
wasn't
quite
sure
of
but
you
didn't
have
any
medicine
mr
keene
said
you
had
a
placebo
a
placebo
eddie
is
something
that
jooks
like
medicine
and
tastes
like
medicine
but
isn't
medicine
a
placebo
isn't
medicine
because
it
has
no
active
ingredients
or
if
it
is
medicine
it
medicine
of
a
very
special
sort
headmedicine
mr
keene
smiled
do
you
understand
that
eddie
head
medicine
eddie
understood
all
right
mr
keene
was
telling
him
he
was
crazy
but
through
numb
lips
he
said
no
i
don't
get
you
let
me
tell
you
a
little
story
mr
keene
said
in
a
series
of
medical
tests
on
ulcer
patients
was
run
at
depaul
university
one
hundred
ulcer
patients
were
given
pills
they
were
all
told
the
pills
would
help
their
ulcers
but
fifty
of
the
patients
really
got
placebos
they
were
in
fact
m&ampm
given
a
uniform
pink
coating
mr
keene
uttered
a
strange
shrill
giggle
that
of
a
man
describing
a
prank
rather
than
an
experiment
of
those
one
hundred
patients
ninetythree
said
they
felt
a
definite
improvement
and
eightyone
showed
an
improvement
so
what
do
you
think
what
conclusion
do
you
draw
from
such
an
experiment
eddie
don't
know
eddie
said
faintly
mr
keene
tapped
his
head
solemnly
most
sickness
starts
in
here
that
what
j
think
i've
been
in
this
business
a
long
long
time
and
i
knew
about
placebos
a
mighty
stretch
of
years
before
those
doctors
at
depaul
university
did
their
study
usually
it
old
folks
who
end
up
getting
the
placebos
the
old
fellow
or
the
old
girl
will
go
to
the
doctor
convinced
that
they've
got
heart
disease
or
cancer
or
diabetes
or
some
damn
thing
but
in
a
good
many
cases
it
nothing
like
that
at
all
they
don't
feel
good
because
they're
old
that
all
but
what
a
doctor
to
do
tell
them
they're
like
watches
with
wornout
mainsprings
huh
not
likely
doctors
like
their
fees
too
much
and
now
mr
keene
face
wore
an
expression
somewhere
between
a
smile
and
a
sneer
eddie
just
sat
there
waiting
for
it
to
be
over
to
be
over
to
be
over
you
didn't
have
any
medicine
those
words
clanged
in
his
mind
the
doctors
don't
tell
them
that
and
i
don't
tell
them
that
either
why
bother
sometimes
an
old
party
will
come
in
with
a
prescription
blank
that
will
say
it
right
out
placebo
or
grains
blue
skies
which
was
how
old
doc
pearson
used
to
put
it
mr
keene
cackled
briefly
and
then
sucked
on
his
coffee
soda
well
what
wrong
with
it
he
asked
eddie
and
when
eddie
only
sat
there
mr
keene
answered
his
own
question
why
nothing
nothing
at
all
at
least
usually
placebos
are
a
blessing
for
old
people
and
then
there
are
other
cases
folks
with
cancer
folks
with
degenerative
heart
disease
folks
with
terrible
things
that
we
don't
understand
yet
some
of
them
children
just
like
you
eddie
in
cases
like
that
if
a
placebo
makes
the
patient
feel
better
where
is
the
harm
do
you
see
the
harm
eddie
no
sir
eddie
said
and
looked
down
at
the
splatter
of
chocolate
ice
cream
sodawater
whipped
cream
and
broken
glass
on
the
floor
in
the
middle
of
all
this
was
the
maraschino
cherry
as
accusing
as
a
bloodclot
at
a
crime
scene
looking
at
this
mess
made
his
chest
feel
tight
again
then
we're
like
ike
and
mike
we
think
alike
five
years
ago
when
vernon
maitland
had
cancer
of
the
esophagus
a
painful
painful
sort
of
cancer
and
the
doctors
had
run
out
of
anything
effective
they
could
give
him
for
his
pain
i
came
by
his
hospital
room
with
a
bottle
of
sugarpills
he
was
a
special
friend
you
see
and
i
said
vern
these
are
special
experimental
painpills
the
doctor
doesn't
know
i'm
giving
them
to
you
so
for
god
sake
be
careful
ad
don't
tattle
on
me
they
might
not
work
but
i
think
they
will
take
no
more
than
one
a
day
and
only
if
the
pain
is
especially
bad
he
thanked
me
with
tears
in
his
eyes
tears
eddie
and
they
worked
for
him
yes
they
were
only
sugarpills
but
they
killed
most
of
his
pain
because
pain
is
here
solemnly
mr
keene
tapped
his
head
again
eddie
said
my
medicine
does
so
work
i
know
it
does
mr
keene
replied
and
smiled
a
maddening
complacent
grownup
smile
tt
works
on
your
chest
because
it
works
on
your
head
hydrox
eddie
is
water
with
a
dash
of
camphor
thrown
in
to
give
it
a
medicine
taste

eddie
said
his
breath
had
begun
to
whistle
again
mr
keene
drank
some
of
his
soda
spooned
some
of
the
melting
ice
cream
and
fastidiously
wiped
his
chin
with
his
handkerchief
while
eddie
used
his
aspirator
again
i
want
to
go
now
eddie
said
let
me
finish
please
no
i
want
to
go
you've
got
your
money
and
i
want
to
g
let
me
finish
mr
keene
said
so
forbiddingly
that
eddie
sat
back
in
his
chair
grownups
could
be
so
hateful
in
their
power
sometimes
so
hateful
part
of
the
problem
here
is
that
your
doctor
russ
handor
is
weak
and
pan
of
the
problem
is
that
your
mother
is
determined
you
are
ill
you
eddie
have
been
caught
in
the
middle
tm
not
crazy
eddie
whispered
the
words
coming
out
in
a
bare
husk
mr
keene
chair
creaked
like
a
monstrous
cricket
wha
said
i'm
not
crazy
eddie
shouted
then
immediately
a
miserable
blush
rose
into
his
face
mr
keene
smiled
think
what
you
like
that
smile
said
think
what
you
like
and
tii
think
what
j
like
all
i'm
telling
you
eddie
is
that
you're
not
physically
ill
your
lungs
don't
have
asthma
your
mind
does
you
mean
i'm
crazy
mr
keene
leaned
forward
looking
at
him
intently
over
his
folded
hands
i
don't
know
he
said
softly
are
you
tt
all
a
lie
eddie
cried
surprised
the
words
came
out
so
strongly
from
his
tight
chest
he
was
thinking
of
bill
how
bill
would
react
to
such
amazing
charges
bill
would
know
what
to
say
stutter
or
not
bill
would
know
how
to
be
brave
all
a
great
big
lie
i
do
have
asthma
i
d
ye
mr
keene
said
and
now
the
dry
smile
had
become
a
weird
skeletal
grin
but
who
gave
it
to
you
eddie
eddie
brain
thudded
and
whirled
oh
he
felt
sick
he
felt
very
sick
four
years
ago
in
the
same
year
as
the
depaul
tests
oddly
enough
dr
handor
began
prescribing
this
hydrox
for
you
that
stands
for
hydrogen
and
oxygen
the
two
components
of
water
i
have
condoned
this
deception
since
then
but
i
will
not
condone
it
anymore
your
asthma
medicine
works
on
your
mind
rather
than
your
body
your
asthma
is
the
result
of
a
nervous
tightening
of
the
diaphragm
that
is
ordered
by
your
mind
or
your
mother
you
are
not
sick
a
terrible
silence
descended
eddie
sat
in
his
chair
his
mind
whirling
for
a
moment
he
considered
the
possibility
that
mr
keene
might
be
telling
the
truth
but
there
were
ramifications
in
such
an
idea
that
he
could
not
face
yet
why
would
mr
keene
lie
especially
about
something
so
serious
mr
keene
sat
and
smiled
his
bright
dry
heartless
desert
smile
ido
have
asthma
i
do
the
day
that
henry
bowers
punched
me
in
the
nose
the
day
bill
and
i
were
trying
to
make
a
dam
in
the
barrens
i
almost
died
am
i
supposed
to
think
that
my
mind
was
just
just
making
all
of
that
up
but
why
would
he
lie
it
was
only
years
later
in
the
library
that
eddie
asked
himself
the
more
terrible
question
why
would
he
tell
me
the
truth
dimly
he
heard
mr
keene
saying
tve
kept
my
eye
on
you
eddie
i
told
you
all
this
because
you're
old
enough
to
understand
but
also
because
i've
noticed
you've
finally
made
some
friends
they
are
good
friends
aren't
they
ye
eddie
said
mr
keene
tilted
his
chair
back
it
made
that
cricketlike
noise
again
and
closed
one
eye
in
what
might
or
might
not
have
been
a
wink
and
i'll
bet
your
mother
doesn't
like
them
much
does
she
she
likes
them
fine
eddie
said
thinking
of
the
cutting
things
his
mother
had
said
about
richie
tozier
he
has
a
foul
mouth
and
i've
smelled
his
breath
eddie
i
think
he
smokes}
her
sniffing
remark
not
to
loan
any
money
to
stan
uris
because
he
was
a
jew
her
outright
dislike
of
bill
denbrough
and
that
fatboy
he
repeated
to
mr
keene
she
likes
them
a
jot
does
she
mr
keene
said
still
smiling
well
maybe
she
right
and
maybe
she
wrong
but
at
least
you
have
friends
maybe
you
ought
to
talk
to
them
about
this
problem
of
yours
this
this
mental
weakness
see
what
they
have
to
say
eddie
didn't
reply
he
was
through
talking
to
mr
keene
that
seemed
safer
and
he
was
afraid
that
if
he
didn't
get
out
of
here
soon
he
really
would
cry
well
mr
keene
said
standing
up
i
think
that
just
about
finishes
us
up
eddie
if
i've
upset
you
i'm
sorry
i
was
only
doing
my
duty
as
i
saw
it
i
but
before
he
could
say
any
more
eddie
had
snatched
up
his
aspirator
and
the
white
bag
of
pills
and
nostrums
and
had
fled
one
of
his
feet
skidded
in
the
icecreamy
mess
on
the
floor
and
he
almost
fell
then
he
was
running
bolting
from
the
center
street
drug
store
in
spite
of
his
whistling
breath
ruby
stared
after
him
over
her
movie
magazine
her
mouth
open
behind
him
he
seemed
to
sense
mr
keene
standing
in
the
doorway
of
his
office
and
watching
his
graceless
retreat
over
the
prescription
counter
gaunt
and
neat
and
thoughtful
and
smiling
smiling
that
dry
desert
smile
he
paused
outside
on
the
threeway
corner
of
kansas
main
and
center
he
took
another
deep
pull
from
his
aspirator
while
sitting
on
the
low
stone
wall
by
the
busstop
his
throat
was
now
positively
slimy
with
that
medicinal
taste
nothing
but
water
with
some
camphor
thrown
in
and
he
thought
that
if
he
had
to
use
the
aspirator
again
today
he
would
probably
puke
his
guts
he
slipped
it
into
his
pocket
and
watched
the
traffic
pass
back
and
forth
headed
up
main
street
and
down
upmile
hill
he
tried
not
to
think
the
sun
beat
down
on
his
head
blaringly
hot
each
passing
car
threw
bright
darts
of
reflection
into
his
eyes
and
a
headache
was
starting
in
his
temples
he
couldn't
find
a
way
to
stay
angry
at
mr
keene
but
he
had
no
trouble
at
all
feeling
bad
for
eddie
kaspbrak
he
felt
real
bad
for
eddie
kaspbrak
he
supposed
that
bill
denbrough
never
wasted
time
feeling
sorry
for
himself
but
eddie
just
couldn't
seem
to
help
it
more
than
anything
else
he
wanted
to
do
exactly
what
mr
keene
had
suggested
go
down
to
the
barrens
and
tell
his
friends
everything
see
what
they
would
say
find
out
what
answers
they
had
but
he
couldn't
do
that
now
his
mother
would
expect
him
home
with
her
medicines
soon
your
mind
or
your
mother
and
if
he
wasn't
there
your
mother
is
determined
you
are
ill
trouble
would
follow
she
would
assume
he
had
been
with
bill
or
richie
or
the
jewbo
as
she
called
stan
insisting
that
she
meant
no
prejudice
by
so
calling
him
but
was
simply
slapping
down
the
card
her
phrase
for
truthtelling
in
difficult
situations
and
standing
here
on
this
comer
trying
hopelessly
to
sort
out
his
flying
thoughts
eddie
knew
what
she
would
say
if
she
knew
one
of
his
other
friends
was
anegro
and
another
was
a
girl
a
girl
old
enough
to
be
getting
bosoms
he
started
slowly
toward
upmile
hill
dreading
the
stiff
climb
in
this
heat
it
felt
almost
hot
enough
to
fry
an
egg
on
the
sidewalk
for
the
first
time
he
found
himself
wishing
school
to
be
in
again
for
a
new
grade
and
a
new
teacher
peculiarities
to
contend
with
for
this
dreadful
summer
to
be
over
he
stopped
halfway
up
the
hill
not
far
from
where
bill
denbrough
would
rediscover
his
bike
silver
twentyseven
years
later
and
pulled
his
aspirator
from
his
pocket
hydrox
mist
the
label
said
administer
as
needed
something
else
clicked
home
administer
as
needed
he
was
only
a
kid
still
wet
behind
the
ears
as
his
mother
sometimes
told
him
when
she
was
slapping
down
the
cards’
but
even
a
kid
of
eleven
knew
that
you
didn't
give
someone
real
medicine
and
then
write
on
the
label
administer
as
needed
if
it
was
real
medicine
it
would
be
too
easy
to
kill
yourself
as
you
went
happyassholing
around
and
administering
as
needed
he
supposed
you
could
kill
yourself
with
plain
old
aspirin
doing
that
he
looked
fixedly
at
the
aspirator
unaware
of
the
old
lady
who
glanced
curiously
at
him
as
she
passed
on
down
the
hill
toward
main
street
with
her
shopping
basket
over
her
arm
he
felt
betrayed
and
for
one
moment
he
almost
cast
the
plastic
squeezebottle
into
the
gutter
better
yet
he
thought
throw
it
down
that
sewergrating
sure
why
not
let
it
have
it
down
there
in
its
tunnels
and
dripping
sewerpipes
have
a
placeebo
you
hundredfaced
creep
he
uttered
a
wild
laugh
and
came
within
an
ace
of
doing
it
but
in
the
end
habit
was
simply
too
strong
he
replaced
the
aspirator
in
his
right
front
pants
pocket
and
walked
on
hardly
hearing
the
occasional
blare
of
a
horn
or
the
diesel
drone
of
the
bassey
park
bus
as
it
passed
him
he
was
likewise
unaware
of
how
close
he
was
to
discovering
what
being
hurt
really
hurt
was
all
about
when
he
came
out
of
the
costello
avenue
market
twentyfive
minutes
later
with
a
pepsi
in
one
hand
and
two
payday
candybars
in
the
other
eddie
was
unpleasantly
surprised
to
see
henry
bowers
victor
criss
moose
sadler
and
patrick
hockstetter
kneeling
on
the
crushed
gravel
to
the
left
of
the
little
store
for
a
moment
eddie
thought
they
were
shooting
craps
then
he
saw
they
were
pooling
their
money
on
victor
baseball
shirt
their
summerschool
text
books
lay
off
to
one
side
in
an
untidy
heap
on
an
ordinary
day
eddie
might
have
simply
faded
quietly
back
into
the
store
and
asked
mr
gedreau
if
he
could
leave
by
the
back
door
but
this
had
been
no
ordinary
day
eddie
froze
right
where
he
was
instead
one
hand
still
holding
the
screen
door
with
its
tin
cigarette
signs
winston
tastes
good
like
a
cigarette
should
twentyone
great
tobaccos
make
twenty
wonderful
smokes
the
bellboy
who
was
shouting
call
for
philip
morris
the
other
clutching
the
brown
grocery
bag
and
the
white
drugstore
bag
victor
criss
saw
him
and
elbowed
henry
henry
looked
up
so
did
patrick
hockstetter
moose
whose
relays
worked
more
slowly
went
on
counting
out
pennies
for
five
seconds
or
so
before
the
sudden
silence
sank
into
him
and
he
also
looked
up
henry
stood
brushing
loose
pieces
of
gravel
from
the
knees
of
the
biballs
he
was
wearing
there
were
splints
on
the
sides
of
his
bandaged
nose
and
his
voice
had
a
nasal
foghorning
quality
well
i
be
go
to
hell
he
said
one
of
the
rockthrowers
where
your
friends
asshole
they
inside
eddie
was
shaking
his
head
numbly
before
he
realized
this
was
another
mistake
henry
smile
broadened
well
that
okay
he
said
i
don't
mind
taking
you
one
by
one
come
on
down
here
asshole
victor
stood
beside
henry
patrick
hockstetter
trailed
behind
them
smiling
in
a
porky
vacant
way
eddie
was
familiar
with
from
school
moose
was
still
getting
up
come
on
asshole
henry
said
let
talk
about
throwing
rocks
let
talk
about
that
you
wanna
now
that
it
was
too
late
eddie
decided
it
would
be
wise
to
go
back
into
the
store
back
in
the
store
where
there
was
a
grownup
but
as
he
retreated
henry
darted
forward
and
grabbed
him
he
pulled
eddie
arm
pulled
hard
his
smile
turning
into
a
snarl
eddie
hand
was
ripped
free
of
the
screen
door
he
was
pulled
off
the
steps
and
would
have
crashed
headlong
into
the
gravel
if
victor
hadn't
caught
him
roughly
under
the
arms
victor
threw
him
eddie
managed
to
keep
on
his
feet
but
only
by
whirling
around
twice
the
four
boys
faced
him
now
over
a
distance
of
about
ten
feet
henry
slightly
ahead
of
the
others
smiling
his
hair
stood
up
at
the
back
in
a
cowlick
behind
henry
and
on
his
left
was
patrick
hockstetter
a
genuinely
spooky
kid
eddie
hadn't
ever
seen
him
with
anyone
else
until
today
he
was
just
enough
overweight
so
that
his
belly
always
hung
slightly
over
his
belt
which
had
a
red
ryder
buckle
his
face
was
perfectly
round
and
usually
as
pale
as
cream
now
he
had
a
slight
sunburn
it
was
heaviest
on
his
nose
which
was
peeling
but
it
spread
out
toward
either
cheek
like
wings
in
school
patrick
liked
to
kill
flies
with
his
green
plastic
skooltime
ruler
and
put
them
in
his
pencilbox
sometimes
he
would
show
his
fly
collection
to
some
new
kid
in
the
playyard
at
recess
his
heavy
lips
smiling
his
graygreen
eyes
sober
and
thoughtful
he
never
spoke
when
he
exhibited
his
dead
flies
no
matter
what
the
new
kid
might
say
to
him
that
expression
was
on
his
face
now
how
ya
doin
rock
man
henry
asked
advancing
across
the
distance
between
them
got
any
rocks
on
you
leave
me
alone
eddie
said
in
a
trembling
voice
leave
me
alone
henry
mimicked
waving
his
hands
in
mock
terror
victor
laughed
what
are
you
going
to
do
if
i
don't
rock
man
huh
his
hand
flashed
out
incredibly
fast
and
exploded
against
eddie
cheek
with
a
gunshot
sound
eddie
head
rocked
back
tears
began
to
pour
from
his
left
eye
my
friends
are
inside
eddie
said
my
friends
are
inside
patrick
hockstetter
squealed
ooooh
ooooh
oooo
he
began
to
circle
to
eddie
right
eddie
started
to
turn
in
that
direction
henry
hand
flashed
out
again
and
this
time
his
other
cheek
flamed
don't
cry
he
thought
that
what
they
want
but
don't
you
do
it
eddie
bill
wouldn't
do
it
bill
wouldn't
cry
and
don't
you
cry
eith
victor
stepped
forward
and
gave
eddie
a
hard
openhanded
push
in
the
middle
of
his
chest
eddie
stumbled
half
a
step
backward
and
then
fell
sprawling
over
patrick
who
had
crouched
directly
behind
his
feet
he
thudded
to
the
gravel
scraping
his
arms
there
was
a
whoof
as
the
wind
rushed
out
of
him
a
moment
later
henry
bowers
was
on
top
of
him
his
knees
pinning
eddie
arms
his
butt
on
eddie
stomach
got
any
rocks
rock
ma
henry
raved
down
at
him
and
eddie
was
more
frightened
by
the
mad
light
in
henry
eyes
than
he
was
by
the
pain
in
his
arms
or
by
his
inability
to
get
his
breath
back
henry
was
nuts
somewhere
close
by
patrick
uttered
you
wanna
throw
rocks
huh
i'll
give
you
rocks
here
here
some
rocks
henry
swept
up
a
handful
of
gravel
and
slammed
it
down
into
eddie
face
he
rubbed
the
gravel
into
eddie
skin
cutting
his
cheeks
his
eyelids
his
lips
eddie
opened
his
mouth
and
screamed
want
rocks
i'll
give
you
rocks
here
some
rocks
rock
man
you
want
rocks
okay
okay
okay
gravel
slammed
into
his
open
mouth
lacerating
his
gums
grinding
against
his
teeth
he
felt
sparks
fly
against
his
fillings
he
screamed
again
and
spat
gravel
out
want
some
more
rocks
okay
how
about
a
few
more
how
about
stop
that
here
here
stop
that
you
boy
quit
on
him
right
now
you
hear
me
quit
on
him
through
halflidded
tearblurred
eyes
eddie
saw
a
big
hand
come
down
and
grab
henry
by
the
collar
of
his
shirt
and
the
right
strap
of
his
biballs
the
hand
gave
a
yank
and
henry
was
pulled
off
he
landed
in
the
gravel
and
got
up
eddie
rose
more
slowly
he
was
trying
to
scramble
to
his
feet
but
his
scrambler
seemed
temporarily
broken
he
gasped
and
spat
chunks
of
bloody
gravel
out
of
his
mouth
it
was
mr
gedreau
dressed
in
his
long
white
apron
and
he
looked
furious
there
was
no
fear
in
his
face
although
henry
stood
about
three
inches
taller
and
probably
outweighed
him
by
fifty
pounds
there
was
no
fear
in
his
face
because
he
was
the
grownup
and
henry
was
the
kid
except
this
time
eddie
thought
that
might
not
mean
anything
mr
gedreau
didn't
understand
he
didn't
understand
that
henry
was
nuts
you
get
out
of
here
mr
gedreau
said
advancing
on
henry
until
he
stood
toe
to
toe
with
the
huking
sullenfaced
boy
you
get
out
and
you
don't
want
to
come
back
either
i
don't
hold
with
bullying
i
don't
hold
with
four
against
one
what
would
your
mothers
think
he
swept
the
others
with
his
hot
angry
eyes
moose
and
victor
dropped
their
gazes
and
examined
their
sneakers
patrick
only
stared
at
and
through
mr
gedreau
with
that
vacant
graygreen
look
mr
gedreau
looked
back
at
henry
and
got
just
as
far
as
you
get
on
your
bikes
and
when
henry
gave
him
a
good
hard
push
an
expression
of
surprise
that
would
have
been
comical
in
other
circumstances
spread
across
mr
gedreau
face
as
he
flew
backward
loose
gravel
spurting
out
from
under
his
heels
he
struck
the
steps
leading
up
to
the
screen
door
and
sat
down
hard
why
you
he
began
henry
shadow
fell
on
him
get
inside
he
said
you
mr
gedreau
said
and
this
time
he
stopped
on
his
own
mr
gedreau
had
finally
seen
it
eddie
realized
the
light
in
henry
eyes
he
got
up
quickly
apron
flapping
he
went
up
the
stairs
as
fast
as
he
could
stumbling
on
the
second
one
from
the
top
and
going
briefly
to
one
knee
he
was
up
again
at
once
but
that
stumble
as
brief
as
it
had
been
seemed
to
rob
him
of
the
rest
of
his
grownup
authority
he
spun
around
at
the
top
and
yelled
t'm
calling
the
cops
henry
made
as
if
to
lunge
for
him
and
mr
gedreau
flinched
back
that
was
the
end
eddie
realized
as
incredible
as
unthinkable
as
it
seemed
there
was
no
protection
for
him
here
it
was
time
to
go
while
henry
was
standing
at
the
bottom
of
the
steps
and
glaring
up
at
mr
gedreau
and
while
the
others
were
staring
transfixed
and
except
for
patrick
hockstetter
not
a
little
horrified
by
this
sudden
successful
defiance
of
adult
authority
eddie
saw
his
chance
he
whirled
took
to
his
heels
and
ran
he
was
halfway
up
the
block
before
henry
turned
his
eyes
blazing
get
hi
he
bellowed
asthma
or
no
asthma
eddie
ran
them
a
good
race
that
day
there
were
spaces
some
of
them
as
long
as
fifty
feet
when
he
couldn't
remember
if
the
soles
of
his
p.p
flyers
had
touched
the
sidewalk
or
not
for
a
few
moments
he
even
entertained
the
giddy
notion
that
he
might
be
able
to
outrun
them
then
just
before
he
reached
kansas
street
and
what
might
have
been
safety
a
ittle
kid
on
a
trike
suddenly
pedaled
out
of
a
driveway
and
right
into
eddie
path
eddie
tried
to
swerve
but
running
fullout
as
he
had
been
he
might
have
done
better
to
jump
over
the
kid
the
kid
name
in
fact
was
richard
cowan
and
he
would
grow
up
marry
and
father
a
son
named
frederick
cowan
who
would
be
drowned
in
a
toilet
and
then
be
partially
eaten
by
a
thing
that
rose
up
from
the
toilet
like
black
smoke
and
then
took
an
unthinkable
shape
or
at
least
to
try
one
of
eddie
feet
caught
on
the
trike
back
deck
where
an
adventurous
little
shit
might
stand
and
push
the
trike
along
like
a
scooter
richard
cowan
whose
unborn
son
would
be
murdered
by
it
twentyseven
years
later
barely
rocked
on
his
trike
eddie
however
went
flying
he
struck
the
sidewalk
on
his
shoulder
rebounded
came
down
again
and
skidded
ten
feet
erasing
the
skin
from
his
elbows
and
knees
he
was
trying
to
get
up
when
henry
bowers
hit
him
like
a
shell
from
a
bazooka
and
knocked
him
flat
eddie
nose
connected
briskly
with
the
concrete
blood
flew
henry
did
a
quick
sideroll
like
a
paratrooper
and
was
up
again
he
grabbed
eddie
by
the
nape
of
the
neck
and
by
his
right
wrist
his
breath
snorting
through
his
swelled
and
splinted
nose
was
warm
and
moist
want
rocks
rock
man
sure
shit
he
jerked
eddie
wrist
halfway
up
his
back
eddie
yelled
rocks
for
the
rock
man
right
rock
man
he
jerked
eddie
wrist
up
even
higher
eddie
screamed
behind
him
dimly
he
could
hear
the
others
approaching
and
the
little
kid
on
the
trike
starting
to
bawl
join
the
club
kid
he
thought
and
in
spite
of
the
pain
in
spite
of
the
tears
and
the
fear
he
brayed
a
huge
donkeylike
heehaw
of
laughter
you
think
this
is
funny
henry
asked
sounding
suddenly
astounded
rather
than
furious
you
think
this
is
funny
and
did
henry
also
sound
scared
years
later
eddie
would
think
yes
scared
he
sounded
scared
eddie
twisted
his
wrist
in
henry
grip
he
was
slick
with
sweat
and
he
almost
got
away
perhaps
that
was
why
henry
shoved
eddie
wrist
up
harder
this
time
than
before
eddie
heard
a
crack
in
his
arm
like
the
sound
of
winterwood
giving
under
an
accumulated
plate
of
ice
the
pain
that
rolled
out
of
his
fractured
arm
was
gray
and
huge
he
shrieked
but
the
sound
seemed
distant
the
color
was
washing
out
of
the
world
and
when
henry
let
go
of
him
and
pushed
he
seemed
to
float
toward
the
sidewalk
it
took
a
long
time
to
get
down
to
that
old
sidewalk
he
had
a
good
look
at
every
single
crack
in
it
as
he
glided
down
he
had
a
chance
to
admire
the
way
the
july
sun
glinted
off
the
flecks
of
mica
in
that
old
sidewalk
he
had
a
chance
to
note
the
remains
of
a
very
old
hopscotch
grid
that
had
been
done
in
pink
chalk
on
that
old
sidewalk
then
for
just
a
moment
it
swam
and
looked
like
something
else
it
looked
like
a
turtle
he
might
have
fainted
then
but
he
struck
on
his
newly
broken
arm
and
this
fresh
pain
was
sharp
bright
hot
terrible
he
felt
the
splintered
ends
of
the
greenstick
fracture
grind
together
he
bit
his
tongue
bringing
fresh
blood
he
rolled
over
on
his
back
and
saw
henry
victor
moose
and
patrick
standing
over
him
they
looked
impossibly
tall
impossibly
high
up
like
pallbearers
peering
into
a
grave
you
like
that
rock
man
henry
asked
his
voice
drifting
down
over
a
distance
floating
through
clouds
of
pain
you
like
that
action
rock
man
you
like
that
jobbanobb
patrick
hockstetter
giggled
your
father
crazy
eddie
heard
himself
say
and
so
are
you
henry
grin
fided
so
fast
it
might
have
been
slapped
off
his
face
he
drew
his
foot
back
to
kick
and
then
a
siren
rose
in
the
still
hot
afternoon
henry
paused
victor
and
moose
looked
around
uneasily
henry
i
think
we
better
get
out
of
here
moose
said
i
know
damn
well
i'm
getting
out
of
here
victor
said
how
far
away
their
voices
seemed
like
the
clown
balloons
they
seemed
to
float
victor
took
off
toward
the
library
cutting
into
mccarron
park
to
get
off
the
street
henry
hesitated
a
moment
longer
perhaps
hoping
the
copcar
was
on
some
other
business
and
he
could
continue
with
his
own
but
the
siren
rose
again
closer
you
got
lucky
fuckfac
he
said
he
and
moose
took
off
after
victor
patrick
hockstetter
waited
for
a
moment
here
a
little
something
extra
for
you
he
whispered
in
his
low
husky
voice
he
inhaled
and
spat
a
large
green
lunger
into
eddie
upturned
sweating
bloody
face
splat
don't
eat
it
all
at
once
if
you
don't
wan
patrick
said
smiling
his
liverish
unsettling
smile
save
some
for
later
if
you
want
then
he
turned
slowly
and
was
also
gone
eddie
tried
to
wipe
the
lunger
off
with
his
good
arm
but
even
that
little
movement
made
the
pain
flare
again
now
when
you
started
off
for
the
drugstore
you
never
thought
you'd
end
up
on
the
costello
avenue
sidewalk
with
a
busted
arm
and
patrick
hockstetter
snot
running
down
your
face
did
you
you
never
even
got
to
drink
your
pepsi
life
full
of
surprises
isn't
it
incredibly
he
laughed
again
it
was
a
weak
sound
and
it
hurt
his
broken
arm
to
laugh
but
it
felt
good
and
there
was
something
else
no
asthma
his
breathing
was
okay
at
least
for
now
a
good
thing
too
he
never
would
have
been
able
to
get
to
his
aspirator
never
in
a
thousand
years
the
siren
was
very
close
now
whooping
and
whooping
eddie
closed
his
eyes
and
saw
red
under
his
eyelids
then
the
red
turned
black
as
a
shadow
fell
over
him
it
was
the
little
kid
with
the
trike
you
okay
the
little
kid
asked
do
i
look
okay
eddie
asked
no
you
look
terrible
the
little
kid
said
and
pedaled
off
singing
the
farmer
in
the
dell
eddie
began
to
giggle
here
was
the
copcar
he
could
hear
the
squeal
of
its
brakes
he
found
himself
hoping
vaguely
that
mr
nell
would
be
in
it
even
though
he
knew
mr
nell
was
a
foot
patrolman
why
in
the
name
of
god
are
you
giggling
he
didn't
know
any
more
than
he
knew
why
he
should
feel
in
spite
of
the
pain
such
intense
relief
was
it
maybe
just
because
he
was
still
alive
that
the
worst
he
had
suffered
was
a
broken
arm
and
there
were
still
some
pieces
to
pick
up
he
settled
for
that
but
years
later
sitting
in
the
derry
library
with
a
glass
of
gin
and
prune
juice
in
front
of
him
and
his
aspirator
near
at
hand
he
old
the
others
he
thought
it
was
something
more
than
that
he
had
been
old
enough
to
feel
that
something
more
but
not
to
understand
or
define
it
i
think
it
was
the
first
real
pain
i
ever
felt
in
my
life
he
would
tell
the
others
it
wasn't
what
i
thought
it
would
be
at
all
it
didn't
put
an
end
to
me
as
a
person
i
think
it
gave
me
a
basis
for
comparison
finding
out
you
could
still
exist
inside
the
pain
in
spite
of
the
pain
eddie
turned
his
head
weakly
to
the
right
and
saw
large
black
firestone
tires
blinding
chrome
hubcaps
and
pulsing
blue
lights
he
heard
mr
nell
voice
then
thickly
irish
impossibly
irish
more
like
richie
irish
cop
voice
than
mr
nell
real
voice
but
perhaps
that
was
the
distance
holy
jaysus
it
the
kaspbrak
bye
at
this
point
eddie
floated
away
and
with
one
exception
stayed
away
for
quite
awhile
there
was
a
brief
period
of
consciousness
in
the
ambulance
he
saw
mr
nell
sitting
across
from
him
tipping
a
drink
from
his
little
brown
bottle
and
reading
a
paperback
called
the
jury
the
girl
on
the
cover
had
the
biggest
bosoms
eddie
had
ever
seen
his
eyes
shifted
past
mr
nell
to
the
driver
up
front
the
driver
peered
around
at
eddie
with
a
big
leering
grin
his
skin
livid
with
greasepant
and
talcum
powder
his
eyes
shiny
as
new
quarters
it
was
pennywise
mr
nel
eddie
husked
mr
nell
looked
up
and
smiled
how
are
you
feelin
me
bye
driver
the
driver
yes
we'll
be
there
in
a
jig
mr
nell
said
and
handed
him
the
little
brown
bottle
suck
some
of
this
it'll
make
ye
feel
better
eddie
drank
what
tasted
like
liquid
fire
he
coughed
hurting
his
arm
he
looked
toward
the
front
and
saw
the
driver
again
just
some
guy
with
a
crewcut
no
clown
he
drifted
off
again
much
later
there
was
the
emergency
room
and
a
nurse
wiping
blood
and
dirt
and
snot
and
gravel
off
his
face
with
a
cold
cloth
it
stung
but
it
felt
wonderful
at
the
same
time
he
heard
his
mother
bugling
and
clarioning
outside
and
he
tried
to
tell
the
nurse
not
to
let
her
in
but
no
words
would
come
out
no
matter
how
hard
he
tried
if
he
dying
i
want
to
know
his
mother
was
bellowing
you
hear
me
it
my
right
to
know
and
it
my
right
to
see
him
i
can
sue
you
you
know
i
know
lawyers
plenty
of
lawyers
some
of
my
best
friends
are
lawyers
don't
try
to
talk
the
nurse
said
to
eddie
she
was
young
and
he
could
feel
her
bosoms
pressing
against
his
arm
for
a
moment
he
had
this
crazy
idea
that
the
nurse
was
beverly
marsh
and
then
he
drifted
away
again
when
he
came
back
his
mother
was
in
the
room
talking
to
dr
handor
at
a
mileaminute
clip
sonia
kaspbrak
was
a
huge
woman
her
legs
encased
in
support
hose
were
trunklike
but
weirdly
smooth
her
face
was
pale
now
except
for
hectic
flaring
blots
of
rouge
m
eddie
managed
all
right
i'm
all
right

you're
not
you're
not
mrs
kaspbrak
moaned
she
wrung
her
hands
eddie
heard
her
knuckles
crack
and
grind
he
began
to
feel
his
breath
shorten
up
as
he
looked
at
her
seeing
what
a
state
she
was
in
how
this
latest
escapade
of
his
had
hurt
her
he
wanted
to
tell
her
to
take
it
easy
or
she'd
have
a
heart
attack
but
he
couldn't
his
throat
was
too
dry
you're
not
all
right
you've
had
a
serious
accident
a
very
serious
accident
but
you
will
be
all
right
i
promise
you
that
eddie
you
will
be
all
right
even
if
we
need
to
bring
in
every
specialist
in
the
book
oh
eddie
eddie
your
poor
arm
she
burst
into
honking
sobs
eddie
saw
that
the
nurse
who
had
washed
his
face
was
looking
at
her
without
much
sympathy
all
through
this
aria
dr
handor
had
been
stuttering
sonia
please
sonia
sonia
he
was
a
skinny
limplooking
man
with
a
little
mustache
that
hadn't
grown
very
well
and
which
in
addition
had
been
clipped
unevenly
so
it
was
longer
on
the
left
side
than
on
the
right
he
looked
nervous
eddie
remembered
what
mr
keene
had
told
him
that
morning
and
felt
a
certain
sorrow
for
dr
handor
at
last
gathering
himself
russ
handor
managed
to
say
if
you
can't
control
yourself
you'll
have
to
leave
sonia
she
whirled
on
him
and
he
drew
back
tii
do
no
such
thing
don't
you
even
suggest
it
this
is
my
son
lying
here
n
agony
my
son
lying
here
on
his
bed
of
pain”
eddie
astounded
them
all
by
finding
his
voice
i
want
you
to
leave
ma
if
they're
going
to
do
something
that'll
make
me
yell
and
i
think
they
are
you'll
feel
better
if
you
go
she
turned
to
him
astonished
and
hurt
at
the
sight
of
the
hurt
on
her
face
he
felt
his
chest
begin
to
tighten
down
inexorably
i
certainly
will
not
she
cried
what
an
awful
thing
to
say
eddie
you're
delirious
you
don't
understand
what
you're
saying
that
the
only
explanation
don't
know
what
the
explanation
is
and
i
don't
care
the
nurse
said
all
i
know
is
that
we're
standing
here
doing
nothing
while
we
should
be
setting
your
son
arm
are
you
suggesting
sonia
began
her
voice
rising
bward
the
high
bugling
note
it
took
on
when
she
was
most
upset
please
sonia
dr
handor
said
let
not
have
an
argument
here
let
help
eddie
sonia
stood
back
but
her
glowering
eyes
the
eyes
of
a
mother
bear
whose
cub
has
been
threatened
promised
the
nurse
that
there
would
be
trouble
later
possibly
even
a
suit
then
her
eyes
misted
extinguishing
the
glower
or
at
least
hiding
it
she
took
eddie
good
hand
and
squeezed
it
so
painfully
that
he
winced
tt
bad
but
you'll
be
well
again
soon
she
said
well
again
soon
i
promise
you
that
sure
ma
eddie
wheezed
could
i
have
my
aspirator
of
course
she
said
sonia
kaspbrak
looked
at
the
nurse
triumphantly
as
if
vindicated
of
some
ridiculous
criminal
charge
my
son
has
asthma
she
said
it
quite
serious
but
he
copes
with
it
beautifully
good
the
nurse
said
flatly
his
ma
held
the
aspirator
for
him
so
he
could
inhale
a
moment
later
dr
handor
was
feeling
eddie
broken
arm
he
was
as
gentle
as
possible
but
the
pain
was
still
enormous
eddie
felt
like
screaming
and
gritted
his
teeth
against
it
he
was
afraid
if
he
screamed
his
mother
would
scream
too
sweat
stood
out
on
his
forehead
in
large
clear
drops
you're
hurting
him
mrs
kaspbrak
said
i
know
you
are
there
no
need
of
that
stop
it
there
no
need
for
you
to
hurt
him
he
very
delicate
he
can't
stand
that
sort
of
pain
eddie
saw
the
nurse
lock
her
furious
eyes
with
dr
handor
tired
worried
ones
he
saw
the
wordless
conversation
that
passed
between
them
send
that
woman
out
of
here
doctor
and
in
the
drop
of
his
eyes
i
can't
i
don't
dare
there
was
great
clarity
inside
the
pain
although
in
truth
this
was
not
a
clarity
that
eddie
would
want
to
experience
often
the
price
was
too
high
and
in
that
unspoken
conversation
eddie
accepted
everything
mr
keene
had
told
him
his
hydrox
aspirator
was
filled
with
nothing
more
than
flavored
water
the
asthma
wasn't
in
his
throat
or
his
chest
or
his
lungs
but
in
his
head
somehow
or
other
he
was
going
to
have
to
deal
with
that
truth
he
looked
at
his
mother
seeing
her
clear
in
his
pain
each
flower
on
her
lane
bryant
dress
the
sweatstains
under
her
arms
where
the
pads
she
wore
had
soaked
through
the
scuffmarks
on
her
shoes
he
saw
how
small
her
eyes
were
in
their
pockets
of
flesh
and
now
a
terrible
thought
came
to
him
those
eyes
were
almost
predatory
like
the
eyes
of
the
leper
that
had
crawled
out
of
the
basement
at
neibolt
street
here
i
come
that
all
right
it
won't
do
you
any
good
to
run
eddie
dr
handor
put
his
hands
gently
around
eddie
broken
arm
and
squeezed
the
pain
exploded
eddie
drifted
away
they
gave
him
some
liquid
to
drink
and
dr
handor
set
the
fracture
he
heard
dr
handor
telling
his
ma
that
it
was
a
greenstick
fracture
no
more
serious
than
any
childhood
break
it
the
sort
of
break
kids
get
falling
out
of
trees
he
said
and
eddie
heard
his
ma
respond
furiously
eddie
doesn't
climb
trees
now
i
want
the
truth
how
bad
is
then
the
nurse
was
giving
him
a
pill
he
felt
her
bosoms
against
his
shoulder
again
and
was
grateful
for
their
comforting
pressure
even
through
the
haze
he
could
see
that
the
nurse
was
angry
and
he
thought
he
said
she
not
the
leper
please
don't
think
that
she
only
eating
me
because
she
loves
me
but
perhaps
nothing
came
out
because
the
nurse
angry
face
didn't
change
he
had
a
faint
recollection
of
being
pushed
up
a
corridor
in
a
wheelchair
and
his
mother
voice
somewhere
behind
fading
what
do
you
mean
visiting
hours
don't
talk
to
me
about
visiting
hours
that
my
son
fading
he
was
glad
she
was
fading
glad
he
was
fading
the
pain
was
gone
and
the
clarity
was
gone
with
it
he
didn't
want
to
think
he
wanted
to
drift
he
was
aware
that
his
nght
arm
felt
very
heavy
he
wondered
if
they
had
put
it
in
a
cast
yet
he
couldn't
seem
to
see
if
they
had
or
not
he
was
vaguely
aware
of
radios
playing
from
rooms
of
patients
who
looked
like
ghosts
in
their
hospital
johnnies
walking
up
and
down
the
wide
halls
and
that
it
was
hot
so
very
hot
when
he
was
wheeled
into
his
room
he
could
see
the
sun
going
down
in
an
angry
orange
boil
of
blood
and
thought
incoherently
like
a
great
big
clownbutton
come
on
eddie
you
can
walk
a
voice
was
saying
and
he
found
that
he
could
he
was
slid
between
crisp
cool
sheets
the
voice
told
him
that
he
would
have
some
pain
in
the
night
but
not
to
ring
for
a
painkiller
unless
it
got
very
bad
eddie
asked
if
he
could
have
a
drink
of
water
the
water
came
with
a
straw
that
had
an
accordion
middle
so
you
could
bend
it
it
was
cool
and
good
he
drank
it
all
there
was
pain
in
the
night
a
good
deal
of
it
he
lay
awake
in
bed
holding
the
callbutton
in
his
left
hand
but
not
pressing
it
a
thunderstorm
was
going
on
outside
and
when
the
lightning
flashed
bluewhite
he
turned
his
head
away
from
the
windows
afraid
he
might
see
a
monstrous
grinning
face
etched
across
the
sky
in
that
electric
fire
at
last
he
slept
again
and
in
his
deep
he
had
a
dream
in
it
he
saw
bill
ben
richie
stan
mike
and
bev
his
friends
arriving
at
the
hospital
on
their
bikes
bill
was
riding
richie
double
on
silver
he
was
surprised
to
see
that
beverly
was
wearing
a
dress
it
was
a
lovely
green
the
color
of
the
caribbean
in
a
national
geographic
plate
he
couldn't
remember
if
he
had
ever
seen
her
in
a
dress
before
all
he
remembered
were
jeans
and
pedal
pushers
and
what
the
girls
called
schookset
skirts
and
blouses
the
blouses
usually
white
with
round
collars
the
skirts
usually
brown
and
pleated
and
hemmed
at
mid
shin
so
that
the
scabs
on
their
knees
didn't
show
in
the
dream
he
saw
them
coming
in
for
the
p.m
visiting
hours
and
his
mother
who
had
been
waiting
patiently
since
eleven
shouting
so
loudly
at
them
that
everyone
turned
to
look
at
her
if
you
think
you're
going
to
go
in
there
you've
got
another
think
coming
eddie
mother
shouted
and
now
the
clown
who
had
been
sitting
here
in
the
waiting
room
all
along
but
way
back
in
one
corner
with
a
copy
of
look
magazine
held
up
in
front
of
his
face
until
now
jumped
up
and
mimed
applause
patting
his
whitegloved
hands
together
rapidly
he
capered
and
danced
now
turning
a
cartwheel
now
executing
a
neat
backover
flip
as
mrs
kaspbrak
ranted
at
eddie
fellow
losers
and
as
they
shrank
one
by
one
behind
bill
who
only
stood
there
pale
but
outwardly
calm
his
hands
stuffed
deep
into
the
pockets
of
his
jeans
maybe
so
no
one
including
bill
himself
would
be
able
to
see
if
they
were
shaking
or
not
no
one
saw
the
clown
except
eddie
although
a
baby
who
had
been
sleeping
peacefully
in
his
mother
arms
awoke
and
began
to
cry
lustily
you've
done
enough
damage
eddie
ma
shouted
i
know
who
those
boys
were
they've
been
in
trouble
at
school
they've
even
been
in
trouble
with
the
police
and
just
because
those
boys
have
something
against
you
is
no
reason
for
them
to
have
something
against
him
i
told
him
so
and
he
agrees
with
me
he
wants
me
to
tell
you
to
go
away
he
done
with
you
he
never
wants
to
see
any
of
you
again
he
doesn't
want
your
socalled
friendship
anymore
any
of
you
i
knew
it
would
lead
to
trouble
and
look
at
this
my
eddie
in
the
hospital
a
boy
as
delicate
as
he
is
the
clown
capered
and
jumped
and
did
splits
and
stood
on
one
hand
its
smile
was
real
enough
now
and
in
his
dream
eddie
realized
that
this
was
of
course
what
the
clown
wanted
a
nice
big
wedge
to
drive
among
them
splitting
them
apart
and
destroying
any
chance
of
concerted
«tion
in
a
kind
of
filthy
ecstasy
the
clown
did
a
double
barrelroll
and
burlesqued
kissing
his
mother
cheek
thththose
bbbhoys
who
dihdid
it
bill
began
don't
you
speak
back
to
me
mrs
kaspbrak
shrieked
don't
you
dare
speak
back
to
me
he
done
with
you
i
say
done
then
an
intern
came
running
into
the
waiting
room
and
told
eddie
ma
she
would
have
to
be
quiet
or
leave
the
hospital
the
clown
started
to
fade
started
to
wash
out
and
as
it
did
it
began
to
change
eddie
saw
the
kper
the
mummy
the
bird
he
saw
the
werewolf
and
a
vampire
whose
teeth
were
gillette
blueblades
set
at
crazy
angles
like
mirrors
in
a
carnival
mirrormaze
he
saw
frankenstein
the
creature
and
something
fleshy
and
shelllike
that
opened
and
closed
like
a
mouth
he
saw
a
dozen
other
terrible
things
a
hundred
but
just
before
the
clown
washed
out
completely
he
saw
the
most
terrible
thing
of
all
his
ma
face
nol
he
tried
to
scream
no
no
not
her
not
my
ma
but
no
one
looked
around
no
one
heard
and
in
the
dream
fading
moments
he
realized
with
a
cold
and
wormy
horror
that
they
couldn't
hear
nun
he
was
dead
it
had
killed
him
and
he
was
dead
he
was
a
ghost
sonia
kaspbrak
soursweet
triumph
at
sending
eddie
socalled
friends
away
evaporated
almost
as
soon
as
she
stepped
into
eddie
private
room
the
next
afternoon
on
the
st
of
july
she
could
not
tell
exactly
why
the
feeling
of
triumph
should
fade
like
that
or
why
it
should
be
displaced
by
an
unfocused
fear
it
was
something
in
her
son
pale
face
which
was
not
blurred
with
pain
or
anxiety
but
instead
bore
an
expression
she
could
not
remember
ever
having
seen
there
before
it
was
sharp
somehow
sharp
and
alert
and
set
the
confrontation
between
eddie
friends
and
eddie
ma
had
not
occurred
in
the
waiting
room
as
in
eddie
dream
she
had
known
they
would
be
coming
eddie
friends
who
were
probably
teaching
him
to
smoke
cigarettes
in
spite
of
his
asthma
his
friend
who
had
such
an
unhealthy
hold
over
him
that
they
were
all
he
talked
about
when
he
came
home
for
the
evening
his
friend
who
got
his
arm
broken
she
had
told
all
of
this
to
mrs
van
prett
next
door
the
time
has
come
mrs
kaspbrak
had
said
grimly
to
slap
a
few
cards
down
on
the
table
mrs
van
prett
who
had
horrible
skinproblems
and
who
could
almost
always
be
counted
upon
to
agree
eagerly
almost
pathetically
with
everything
sonia
kaspbrak
said
in
this
case
had
the
temerity
to
disagree
i
should
think
you'd
be
glad
he
made
some
friends
mrs
van
prett
said
as
they
hung
out
their
washes
in
the
earlymorning
cool
before
work
this
had
been
during
the
first
week
of
july
and
he
safer
if
he
with
other
children
mrs
kaspbrak
don't
you
think
so
with
all
that
going
on
in
this
town
and
all
the
poor
children
that
have
been
murdered
mrs
kaspbrak
only
reply
had
been
an
angry
sniff
in
fact
she
couldn't
just
then
think
of
an
adequate
verbal
response
although
she
thought
of
dozens
some
of
them
extremely
cutting
later
on
and
when
mrs
van
prett
called
her
that
evening
sounding
rather
anxious
to
ask
if
mrs
kaspbrak
would
be
going
to
the
beano
down
at
saint
mary
with
her
like
usual
mrs
kaspbrak
had
replied
coldly
that
she
believed
she
would
just
stay
home
that
evening
and
put
her
feet
up
instead
well
she
hoped
mrs
van
prett
was
satisfied
now
she
hoped
mrs
van
prett
saw
now
that
the
only
danger
abroad
in
derry
this
summer
wasn't
the
sexmaniac
killing
children
and
babies
here
was
her
son
lying
on
his
bed
of
pain
in
derry
home
hospital
he
might
never
be
able
to
use
his
good
right
arm
again
she
had
heard
of
such
things
or
god
forbid
loose
splinters
from
the
break
might
work
through
his
bloodstream
to
his
heart
and
puncture
it
and
kill
him
oh
of
course
god
would
never
allow
that
to
happen
but
she
had
heard
of
it
happening
so
that
meant
god
could
allow
such
a
thing
to
happen
in
certain
cases
so
she
lingered
on
the
home
hospital
long
and
shady
front
porch
knowing
they
would
show
up
coldly
determined
to
put
paid
to
this
socalled
friendship
this
camaraderie
that
ended
in
broken
arms
and
beds
of
pain
once
and
for
all
eventually
they
came
as
she
had
known
they
would
and
to
her
horror
she
saw
that
one
of
them
was
a
nigger
not
that
she
had
anything
against
niggers
she
thought
they
had
every
right
to
ride
where
they
wanted
to
on
the
buses
down
south
and
eat
at
white
lunchcounters
and
should
not
be
made
to
sit
in
nigger
heaven
at
the
movies
unless
they
bothered
white
women
people
but
she
also
believed
firmly
in
what
she
called
the
bird
theory
blackbirds
flew
with
other
blackbirds
not
with
the
robins
crackles
roosted
with
grackles
they
did
not
mix
in
with
the
bluebirds
or
the
nightingales
to
each
his
own
was
her
motto
and
seeing
mike
hanlon
pedal
up
with
the
others
just
as
if
he
belonged
there
caused
her
resolution
like
her
anger
and
her
dismay
to
grow
apace
she
thought
reproachfully
as
if
eddie
were
here
and
could
listen
to
her
you
never
told
me
that
one
of
your
friend
was
a
nigger
well
she
thought
twenty
minutes
later
stepping
into
the
hospital
room
where
her
son
lay
with
his
arm
in
a
huge
cast
that
was
strapped
to
his
chest
it
hurt
her
heart
just
to
look
at
it
she
had
sent
them
packing
in
jig
time
no
pun
intended
none
of
them
except
for
the
denbrough
boy
the
one
who
had
such
a
horrible
stutter
had
had
the
nerve
to
so
much
as
speak
back
to
her
the
girl
whoever
she
was
had
flashed
a
pair
of
decidedly
slutty
jade
eyes
at
sonia
from
lower
main
street
or
someplace
even
worse
had
been
sonia
kaspbrak
opinion
but
she
had
wisely
kept
her
mouth
shut
if
she
had
dared
so
much
as
to
let
out
a
peep
sonia
would
have
given
her
a
piece
of
her
mind
would
have
told
her
what
sort
of
girls
ran
with
the
boys
there
were
names
for
girls
like
that
and
she
would
not
have
her
son
associated
now
or
ever
with
the
girls
who
bore
them
the
others
had
done
no
more
than
look
down
at
their
shuffling
feet
that
was
about
what
she
had
expected
when
she
was
done
saying
what
she
had
to
say
they
had
gotten
on
their
bikes
and
ridden
away
the
denbrough
boy
had
the
tozier
boy
riding
double
behind
him
on
a
huge
unsafelooking
bike
and
with
an
interior
shudder
mrs
kaspbrak
had
wondered
how
many
times
her
eddie
had
ridden
on
that
dangerous
bike
risking
his
arms
and
his
legs
and
his
neck
and
his
life
i
did
this
for
you
eddie
she
thought
as
she
walked
into
the
hospital
with
her
head
firmly
up
i
know
you
may
feel
a
bit
disappointed
at
first
that
natural
enough
but
parents
know
better
than
their
children
the
reason
god
made
parents
in
the
first
place
was
to
guide
instruct
and
protect
after
his
initial
disappointment
he
would
understand
and
if
she
felt
a
certain
relief
now
it
was
of
course
on
eddie
behalf
and
not
on
her
own
relief
was
only
to
be
expected
when
you
had
saved
your
son
from
bad
companions
except
that
her
sense
of
relief
was
marred
by
fresh
unease
now
looking
into
eddie
face
he
was
not
asleep
as
she
had
thought
he
would
be
instead
of
a
drugged
doze
from
which
he
would
wake
disoriented
dimwitted
and
psychologically
vulnerable
there
was
this
sharp
watchful
look
so
different
from
eddie
usual
soft
tentative
glance
like
ben
hanscom
although
sonia
did
not
know
this
eddie
was
the
sort
of
boy
who
would
look
quickly
into
a
face
as
if
to
test
the
emotional
weather
brewing
there
and
glance
just
as
quickly
away
but
he
was
looking
at
her
steadily
now
perhaps
it
the
medication
she
thought
of
course
that
it
i'll
have
to
consult
with
dr
handor
about
his
medication
and
she
was
the
one
who
felt
a
need
to
glance
aside
he
looks
like
he
been
waiting
for
me
she
thought
and
it
was
a
thought
that
should
have
made
her
happy
a
boy
waiting
for
his
mother
must
surely
be
one
of
god
most
favored
creations
you
sent
my
friends
away
the
words
came
out
flatly
with
no
doubt
or
question
in
them
she
flinched
almost
guiltily
and
certainly
the
first
thought
to
flash
through
her
mind
was
a
guilty
one
how
does
he
know
that
he
can't
know
that
and
she
was
immediately
furious
with
herself
and
him
for
feeling
that
way
so
she
smiled
at
him
how
are
we
feeling
today
eddie
that
was
the
right
response
someone
some
foolish
candystriper
or
perhaps
even
that
incompetent
and
antagonistic
nurse
from
the
day
before
had
been
carrying
tales
someone
how
are
we
feeling
she
asked
again
when
he
didn't
respond
she
thought
he
hadn't
heard
her
she'd
never
read
in
any
of
her
medical
literature
of
a
broken
bone
affecting
the
sense
of
hearing
but
she
supposed
it
was
possible
anything
was
possible
eddie
still
didn't
respond
she
came
farther
into
the
room
hating
the
tentative
almost
timid
feeling
inside
her
distrusting
it
because
she
had
never
felt
tentative
or
timid
around
eddie
before
she
felt
anger
as
well
although
that
was
still
nascent
what
right
did
he
have
to
make
her
feel
that
way
after
all
she
had
done
for
him
after
all
she
had
sacrificed
for
him
tve
talked
to
dr
handor
and
he
assures
me
that
you're
going
to
be
perfectly
all
right
sonia
said
briskly
sitting
down
in
the
straightbacked
wooden
chair
by
the
bed
of
course
if
there
the
slightest
problem
we'll
go
to
see
a
specialist
in
portland
in
boston
if
that
what
it
takes
she
miled
as
if
conferring
a
great
favor
eddie
did
not
smile
back
and
still
he
did
not
reply
eddie
are
you
hearing
me
you
sent
my
friends
awa
he
repeated
yes
she
said
dropping
the
pretense
and
said
no
more
two
could
play
at
that
game
she
simply
looked
back
at
him
but
a
strange
thing
happened
a
terrible
thing
really
eddie
eyes
seemed
to
to
grow
somehow
the
flecks
of
gray
in
them
seemed
actually
to
be
moving
like
racing
stormclouds
she
became
aware
suddenly
that
he
was
not
in
a
sni
or
having
a
poopie
or
any
of
those
things
he
was
furious
with
her
and
sonia
was
suddenly
scared
because
something
more
than
her
son
seemed
to
be
in
this
room
she
dropped
her
eyes
and
fumbled
her
purse
open
she
began
searching
for
a
kleenex
yes
i
sent
them
away
she
said
and
found
that
her
voice
was
strong
enough
and
steady
enough
as
long
as
she
wasn't
looking
at
him
you've
been
seriously
injured
eddie
you
don't
need
any
visitors
right
now
except
for
yur
own
ma
and
you
don't
need
visitors
like
that
ever
if
it
hadn't
been
for
them
you'd
be
home
watching
the
tv
right
now
or
building
your
soapbox
racer
in
the
garage
it
was
eddie
dream
to
build
a
soapbox
racer
and
take
it
to
bangor
if
he
won
there
he
would
be
awarded
an
allexpensespaid
trip
to
akron
ohio
for
the
national
soapbox
derby
sonia
was
perfectly
willing
to
allow
him
this
dream
as
long
as
it
seemed
to
her
that
completion
of
the
racer
which
was
made
out
of
orange
crates
and
the
vheels
from
a
choo
choo
flyer
wagon
was
just
that
a
dream
she
certainly
had
no
intention
of
letting
eddie
risk
his
life
in
such
a
dangerous
contraption
not
in
derry
not
in
bangor
and
certainly
not
in
akron
which
eddie
had
informed
her
would
mean
iding
in
an
airplane
as
well
as
making
a
suicidal
run
down
a
steep
hill
in
a
wheeled
orange
crate
with
no
brakes
but
as
her
own
mother
had
often
said
what
a
person
didn't
know
couldn't
hurt
him
her
mother
had
also
been
fond
of
saying
tell
the
truth
and
shame
the
devil
but
when
it
came
to
the
recollection
of
aphorisms
sonia
like
most
people
could
be
remarkably
selective
my
friends
didn't
break
my
arm
eddie
said
in
that
same
flat
voice
i
told
dr
handor
last
night
and
i
told
mr
nell
when
he
came
in
this
morning
henry
bowers
broke
my
arm
some
other
kids
were
with
him
but
henry
did
it
if
i'd
been
with
my
friends
it
never
would
have
happened
it
happened
because
i
was
alone
this
made
sonia
think
of
mrs
van
prett
comment
about
how
was
safer
to
have
friends
and
that
brought
the
rage
back
like
a
tiger
she
snapped
her
head
up
that
doesn't
matter
and
you
know
it
what
do
you
think
eddie
that
your
ma
fell
off
a
haytruck
yesterday
is
that
what
you
think
i
know
well
enough
why
the
bowers
boy
broke
your
arm
that
paddy
cop
was
at
our
house
too
that
big
boy
broke
your
arm
because
you
and
your
friends
crossed
him
somehow
now
do
you
think
that
would
have
happened
if
you'd
listened
to
me
and
stayed
away
from
them
in
the
first
place
no
i
think
that
something
even
worse
might
have
happened
eddie
said
eddie
you
don't
mean
that
mean
it
he
said
and
she
felt
that
power
coming
off
him
coming
out
of
him
in
waves
bill
and
the
rest
of
my
friends
will
be
back
ma
that
something
z
know
and
when
they
come
youre
not
going
to
stop
them
you're
not
going
to
say
a
word
to
them
they're
my
friends
and
you're
not
going
to
steal
my
friends
just
because
you're
scared
of
being
alone
she
stared
at
him
flabbergasted
and
terrified
tears
filled
her
eyes
and
spilled
down
her
cheeks
wetting
the
powder
there
this
is
how
you
talk
to
your
mother
now
i
guess
she
said
through
her
sobs
maybe
this
is
the
way
your
friends
talk
to
their
folks
i
guess
you
learned
it
from
them
she
felt
safer
in
her
tears
usually
when
she
cried
eddie
cried
too
a
low
weapon
some
might
say
but
were
there
really
any
low
weapons
when
it
came
to
protecting
her
son
she
thought
not
she
looked
up
the
tears
streaming
from
her
eyes
feeling
both
unutterably
sad
bereft
betrayed
and
sure
eddie
would
not
be
able
to
stand
against
such
a
flood
of
tears
and
sorrow
that
cold
sharp
look
would
leave
his
face
perhaps
he
would
begin
to
gasp
and
wheeze
a
little
bit
and
that
would
be
a
sign
as
it
was
always
a
sign
that
the
fight
was
over
and
that
she
had
won
another
victory
for
him
of
course
always
for
him
she
was
so
shocked
to
see
that
same
expression
on
his
face
it
had
if
anything
deepened
that
her
voice
caught
in
midsob
there
was
sorrow
under
his
expression
but
even
that
was
frightening
it
struck
her
in
some
way
as
an
adult
sorrow
and
thinking
of
eddie
as
adult
in
any
way
always
caused
a
panicky
little
bird
to
flutter
inside
her
mind
this
was
how
he
felt
on
the
infrequent
occasions
when
she
wondered
what
would
happen
to
her
if
eddie
didn't
want
to
go
to
derry
business
college
or
the
university
of
maine
in
orono
or
husson
in
bangor
so
he
could
come
home
every
day
after
his
classes
were
done
what
would
happen
if
he
met
a
girl
fell
in
love
wanted
to
get
married
where
the
place
for
me
in
any
of
that
the
panicky
birdvoice
would
cry
when
these
strange
almost
nightmarish
thoughts
came
where
would
my
place
be
in
a
life
like
that
i
love
you
eddie
i
love
you
i
take
care
of
you
and
i
love
you
you
don't
know
how
to
cook
or
change
your
sheets
or
wash
your
underwear
why
should
you
i
know
those
things
for
you
i
know
because
i
love
you
he
said
it
himself
now
love
you
ma
but
i
love
my
friends
too
i
think
i
think
you're
making
yourself
cry
eddie
you
hurt
me
so
much
she
whispered
and
fresh
tears
doubled
his
pale
face
trebled
it
if
her
tears
a
few
moments
ago
had
been
calculated
these
were
not
in
her
own
peculiar
way
she
was
tough
she
had
seen
her
husband
into
his
grave
without
cracking
up
she
had
gotten
a
job
in
a
depressed
jobmarket
where
it
wasn't
easy
to
get
a
job
she
had
raised
her
son
and
when
it
had
been
necessary
she
had
fought
for
him
these
were
the
first
totally
unaffected
and
uncalculated
tears
she
had
wept
in
years
perhaps
since
eddie
had
gotten
the
bronchitis
when
he
was
five
and
she
had
been
so
sure
he
would
die
as
he
lay
there
in
his
bed
of
pain
glowing
bright
with
fever
whooping
and
coughing
and
gasping
for
breath
she
wept
now
because
of
that
terribly
adult
somehow
alien
expression
on
his
face
she
was
afraid
for
him
but
she
was
also
in
some
way
afraid
of
him
afraid
of
that
aura
that
seemed
to
surround
him
which
seemed
to
demand
something
of
her
don't
make
me
have
to
choose
between
you
and
my
friends
ma
eddie
said
his
voice
was
uneven
strained
but
still
under
control
because
that
not
fair
they're
bad
friends
eddie
she
cried
in
a
nearfrenzy
i
know
that
i
feel
that
with
all
my
heart
they'll
bring
you
nothing
but
pain
and
grief
and
the
most
horrible
thing
of
all
was
that
she
did
sense
that
some
part
of
her
had
intuited
it
in
the
eyes
of
the
denbrough
boy
who
had
stood
before
her
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
his
red
hair
flaming
in
the
summer
sun
his
eyes
had
been
so
grave
so
strange
and
distant
like
eddie
eyes
now
and
hadn't
that
same
aura
been
around
him
as
was
around
eddie
now
the
same
but
even
stronger
she
thought
yes
ma
she
stood
up
so
suddenly
she
almost
knocked
the
straight
backed
chair
over
tl
come
back
this
evening
she
said
it
the
shock
the
accident
the
pain
those
things
that
make
you
talk
this
way
i
know
it
you
you
she
groped
and
found
her
original
text
in
the
flying
confusion
of
her
mind
you've
had
a
bad
accident
but
you're
going
to
be
just
fine
and
you'll
see
i'm
right
eddie
they're
bad
friends
not
our
sort
not
for
you
you
think
it
over
and
ask
yourself
if
your
ma
ever
told
you
wrong
before
you
think
about
it
and
and
i'm
running
she
thought
with
a
sick
and
hurtful
dismay
i'm
running
away
from
my
own
son
oh
god
please
don't
let
this
be
ma
for
a
moment
she
almost
fled
anyway
scared
of
him
now
oh
yes
he
was
more
than
eddie
she
sensed
the
others
in
him
his
friend
and
something
else
something
that
was
beyond
even
them
and
she
was
afraid
it
might
flash
out
at
her
it
was
as
if
he
were
in
the
grip
of
something
some
dreadful
fever
as
he
had
been
in
the
grip
of
the
bronchitis
that
time
when
he
was
five
when
he
had
almost
died
she
paused
her
hand
on
the
doorknob
not
wanting
to
hear
what
he
might
say
and
when
he
said
it
it
was
so
unexpected
that
for
a
moment
she
didn't
really
understand
it
when
comprehension
crashed
down
it
came
like
a
loose
load
of
cement
and
for
a
moment
she
thought
she
would
faint
eddie
said
mr
keene
said
my
asthma
medicine
is
just
water
what
what
she
turned
blazing
eyes
on
him
just
water
with
some
stuff
added
to
make
it
taste
like
medicine
he
said
it
was
a
placee
bo
that
a
lie
that
is
nothing
but
a
solid
lie
why
would
mr
keene
want
to
tell
you
a
lie
like
that
well
there
are
other
drugstores
in
derry
i
guess
i
guess
tve
had
time
to
think
about
it
eddie
said
softly
and
implacably
his
eyes
never
leaving
hers
and
/
think
he
telling
the
truth
eddie
i
tell
you
he
not
the
panic
was
back
fluttering
what
i
think
eddie
said
is
that
it
must
be
the
truth
or
there
would
be
some
kind
of
warning
on
the
bottle
like
if
you
take
too
much
it
will
kill
you
or
at
least
make
you
sick
even
eddie
i
don't
want
to
hear
thi
she
cried
and
clapped
her
hands
to
her
ears
you're
youre
you're
just
not
yourself
and
that
all
that
it
i
even
if
it
something
you
can
just
go
in
and
buy
without
a
prescription
they
put
special
instructions
on
it
he
went
on
not
raising
his
voice
his
gray
eyes
lay
on
hers
and
she
couldnt
seem
to
drop
her
gaze
or
even
move
it
even
if
it
just
vicks
cough
syrup
or
your
geritol
he
paused
for
a
moment
her
hands
dropped
from
her
ears
it
seemed
too
much
work
to
hold
them
up
they
seemed
very
heavy
and
it
like
you
must
have
known
that
too
ma
eddie
she
nearly
wailed
it
because
he
went
on
as
if
she
had
not
spoken
at
all
he
was
frowning
now
concentrating
on
the
problem
because
your
folks
are
supposed
to
know
about
medicines
why
i
use
that
aspirator
five
sometimes
six
times
a
day
and
you
wouldn't
let
me
do
that
if
you
thought
it
could
like
hurt
me
because
it
your
job
to
protect
me
i
know
it
is
because
that
what
you
always
say
so
did
you
know
ma
did
you
know
it
was
just
water
she
said
nothing
her
lips
were
trembling
it
felt
as
if
her
whole
face
was
trembling
she
was
no
longer
crying
she
felt
too
scared
to
cry
because
if
you
did
eddie
said
still
frowning
if
you
did
know
i'd
want
to
know
why
i
can
figure
some
things
out
but
not
why
my
ma
would
want
me
to
think
water
was
medicine
or
that
i
had
asthma
here
he
pointed
to
his
chest
when
mr
keene
says
i
only
have
it
up
her
and
he
pointed
to
his
head
she
thought
she
would
explain
everything
then
she
would
explain
it
quietly
and
logically
how
she
had
thought
he
was
going
to
die
when
he
was
five
and
how
that
would
have
driven
her
crazy
after
losing
frank
only
two
years
before
how
she
came
to
understand
that
you
could
only
protect
your
child
through
watchfulness
and
love
that
you
must
tend
a
child
as
you
tended
a
garden
fertilizing
weeding
and
yes
occasionally
pruning
and
thinning
as
much
as
that
hurt
she
would
tell
him
that
sometimes
it
was
better
for
a
child
particularly
a
delicate
child
like
eddie
to
think
he
was
sick
than
to
really
get
sick
and
she
would
finish
by
talking
to
him
about
the
deadly
foolishness
of
doctors
and
the
wonderful
power
of
love
she
would
tell
him
that
she
knew
he
had
asthma
and
it
didn't
matter
what
he
doctors
thought
or
what
they
gave
him
for
it
she
would
tell
him
you
could
make
medicine
with
more
than
a
malicious
meddling
druggist
mortar
and
pestle
eddie
she
would
say
it
medicine
because
your
mother
love
makes
it
medicine
and
in
just
that
way
for
as
long
as
you
want
me
and
let
me
i
can
do
that
this
is
a
power
that
god
gives
to
loving
caring
mothers
please
eddie
please
my
heart
own
love
you
must
believe
me
but
in
the
end
she
said
nothing
her
fright
was
too
great
but
maybe
we
don't
even
have
to
talk
about
it
eddie
went
on
mr
keene
might
have
been
joking
with
me
sometimes
grownups
you
know
they
like
to
play
jokes
on
kids
because
kids
believe
almost
anything
it
mean
to
do
that
to
kids
but
sometimes
grownups
do
it
yes
sonia
kaspbrak
said
eagerly
they
like
to
joke
and
sometimes
they're
stupid
mean...and...and
so
i'll
kind
of
keep
an
eye
out
for
bill
and
the
rest
of
my
friends
eddie
said
and
keep
right
on
using
my
asthma
medicine
that
probably
best
don't
you
think
she
realized
only
now
when
it
was
too
late
how
neatly
how
cruelly
she
had
been
trapped
what
he
was
doing
was
almost
blackmail
but
what
choice
did
she
have
she
wanted
to
ask
him
how
he
could
be
so
calculating
so
manipulative
she
opened
her
mouth
to
ask
and
then
closed
it
again
it
was
too
likely
that
in
his
present
mood
he
might
answer
but
she
knew
one
thing
yes
one
thing
for
sure
she
would
never
never
never
set
foot
into
mr
nosy
parker
keene
drugstore
again
in
her
life
his
voice
oddly
shy
now
interrupted
her
thoughts
m
she
looked
up
and
saw
it
was
eddie
again
just
eddie
and
she
went
to
him
gladly
can
i
have
a
hug
ma
she
hugged
him
but
carefully
so
as
not
to
hurt
his
broken
arm
or
dislodge
any
loose
bonefragments
so
they
could
run
an
evil
race
around
his
bloodstream
and
then
lodge
in
his
heart
what
mother
would
kill
her
son
with
love
and
eddie
hugged
her
back
as
far
as
eddie
was
concerned
his
ma
left
just
in
time
during
the
horrible
confrontation
with
her
he
had
felt
his
breath
piling
up
and
up
and
up
in
his
lungs
and
throat
still
and
tideless
stale
and
brackish
threatening
to
poison
him
he
held
on
until
the
door
had
snicked
shut
behind
her
and
then
he
began
to
gasp
and
wheeze
the
sour
air
working
in
his
tight
throat
jabbed
up
and
down
like
a
warm
poker
he
grabbed
for
his
aspirator
hurting
his
arm
but
not
caring
he
triggered
a
long
blast
down
his
throat
he
breathed
deep
of
the
camphor
taste
thinking
it
doesn't
matter
if
it
a
placeebo
words
don't
matter
if
a
thing
works
he
lay
back
against
his
pillows
eyes
closed
breathing
freely
for
the
first
time
since
she
had
come
in
he
was
scared
plenty
scared
the
hings
he
had
said
to
her
the
way
he
had
acted
it
had
been
him
and
yet
it
hadn't
been
him
at
all
there
had
been
something
working
in
him
working
through
him
some
force
and
his
mother
had
felt
it
too
he
had
seen
it
in
her
eyes
and
in
her
trembling
lips
he
had
no
sense
that
this
power
was
an
evil
one
but
its
enormous
strength
was
frightening
it
was
like
getting
on
an
amusementpark
ride
that
was
really
dangerous
and
realizing
you
couldn't
get
off
until
it
was
over
come
what
might
no
turning
around
eddie
thought
feeling
the
hot
itchy
weight
of
the
cast
that
encased
his
broken
arm
no
one
goes
home
until
we
get
to
the
end
but
god
i'm
so
scared
so
scared
and
he
knew
that
the
truest
reason
for
demanding
she
not
cut
him
off
from
his
friends
was
something
he
could
never
have
told
her
j
can't
face
this
alone
he
cried
a
little
then
and
then
drifted
off
into
a
restless
sleep
he
dreamed
of
a
darkness
in
which
machinery
pumping
machinery
ran
on
and
on
it
was
threatening
showers
again
that
evening
when
bill
and
the
rest
of
the
losers
returned
to
the
hospital
eddie
was
not
surprised
to
see
them
come
filing
in
he
had
known
they
would
be
back
it
had
been
hot
all
day
it
was
generally
agreed
later
that
that
third
week
of
july
was
the
hottest
of
an
exceptionally
hot
summer
and
the
thunderheads
began
to
build
up
around
four
in
the
afternoon
purpleblack
and
colossal
pregnant
with
rain
loaded
with
lightnings
people
went
about
their
errands
quickly
and
a
little
uneasily
with
one
eye
always
cocked
at
the
sky
most
agreed
it
would
rain
good
and
hard
by
dinnertime
washing
some
of
the
thick
humidity
out
of
the
ear
derry
parks
and
playgrounds
underpopulated
all
summer
were
totally
deserted
that
evening
by
six
the
rain
had
still
not
fallen
and
the
swings
hung
moveless
and
shadeless
in
a
light
that
was
a
queer
flat
yellow
thunder
rumbled
thickly
that
a
barking
dog
and
the
low
mutter
of
traffic
on
outer
main
street
were
the
only
sounds
that
drifted
in
through
eddie
window
until
the
losers
came
bill
was
first
followed
by
richie
beverly
and
stan
followed
them
then
mike
ben
came
last
he
looked
excruciatingly
uncomfortable
in
a
white
trurtleneck
sweater
they
came
to
his
bed
solemn
not
even
richie
was
smiling
their
faces
eddie
thought
fascinated
jeezumcrow
their
faces
he
was
seeing
in
them
what
his
mother
had
seen
in
him
that
afternoon
that
odd
combination
of
power
and
helplessness
the
yellow
stormlight
lay
on
their
skins
making
their
faces
seem
ghostlike
distant
shadowy
we're
passing
over
eddie
thought
passing
over
into
something
new
we're
on
the
border
but
what
on
the
other
side
where
are
we
going
where
hhhello
eheheddie
bill
said
how
you
dddoi
okay
big
bill
eddie
said
and
tried
to
smile
had
a
day
yesterday
i
guess
mike
said
thunder
rumbled
behind
his
voice
neither
the
overhead
light
nor
the
bedside
lamp
was
on
in
eddie
room
and
all
of
them
seemed
to
fade
in
and
out
of
the
bruised
light
eddie
thought
of
that
light
all
over
derry
right
now
lying
long
and
still
across
mccarron
park
falling
through
the
holes
in
the
roof
of
the
kissing
bridge
in
smudged
lackadaisical
rays
making
the
kenduskeag
look
like
smoky
glass
as
ifcut
its
broad
shallow
path
through
the
barrens
he
thought
of
seesaws
standing
at
dead
angles
behind
derry
elementary
as
the
thunderheads
piled
up
and
up
he
thought
of
this
thundery
yellow
light
and
the
stillness
as
if
the
whole
town
had
fallen
asleep
or
died
yes
he
said
it
was
a
big
day
my
ffolks
are
g¢
going
out
to
a
muhmuhmovie
the
night
aaafter
mnext
bill
said
when
the
ppichictures
change
we're
ggoing
to
mmake
them
then
the
suhsuhsuh
silver
balls
richie
said
i
though
its
better
this
way
ben
said
quietly
i
still
think
we
could
have
made
the
bullets
but
thinking
isn't
good
enough
if
we
were
grownups
oh
yeah
the
world
would
be
peachy
if
we
were
grownups
beverly
said
grownups
can
make
anything
they
want
can't
they
grownups
can
do
anything
they
want
and
it
always
comes
out
right
she
laughed
a
jagged
nervous
sound
bill
wants
me
to
shoot
it
can
you
feature
that
eddie
just
call
me
beverly
oakley
don't
know
what
you're
talking
about
eddie
said
but
he
thought
he
did
he
was
getting
some
kind
of
picture
anyway
ben
explained
they
would
melt
down
one
of
his
silver
dollars
and
make
two
silver
balls
a
little
smaller
than
ballbearings
and
then
if
there
really
was
a
werewolf
residing
at
neibolt
street
beverly
would
put
a
silver
ball
into
its
head
with
bill
bullseye
slingshot
goodbye
werewolf
and
if
they
were
right
about
one
creature
who
wore
many
faces
goodbye
it
there
must
have
been
some
sort
of
expression
on
eddie
face
because
richie
laughed
and
nodded
know
how
you
feel
man
i
thought
bill
must
have
lost
his
few
remaining
marbles
when
he
started
talking
about
using
his
slingshot
instead
of
his
dad
gun
but
this
afternoon
he
stopped
and
cleared
his
throat
this
afternoon
after
your
ma
blew
us
out
of
the
water
was
how
he
had
been
about
to
start
and
that
obviously
wouldn't
do
this
afternoon
we
went
down
to
the
dump
bill
brought
his
bullseye
look
from
his
back
pocket
richie
took
a
flattened
can
which
had
once
held
del
monte
pineapple
chunks
there
was
a
ragged
hole
about
two
inches
in
diameter
through
the
middle
of
it
beverly
did
that
with
a
rock
from
twenty
feet
away
looks
like
a
to
me
de
trashmouth
was
convinced
and
when
de
trashmouth
is
convinced
de
trashmouth
is
convinced
killing
cans
is
one
thing
beverly
said
if
it
was
something
else
something
alive
bill
you
should
be
the
one
really
nn
bill
said
we
aaall
took
turns
you
suhsuhsaw
how
it
wwwent
how
did
it
go
eddie
asked
bill
explained
slowly
and
haltingly
while
beverly
looked
out
the
window
with
her
lips
pressed
so
tightly
together
they
were
white
she
was
for
reasons
she
could
not
explain
even
to
herself
more
than
afraid
she
was
deeply
embarrassed
by
what
had
happened
today
on
the
way
over
here
tonight
she
had
argued
again
passionately
that
they
try
to
make
the
bullets
after
all
not
because
she
was
any
more
sure
than
bill
or
richie
that
they
would
actually
work
when
the
time
came
but
because
if
something
did
happen
out
at
that
house
the
weapon
would
be
in
bill
someone
else
hands
but
facts
were
facts
they
had
each
taken
ten
rocks
each
and
shot
the
bullseye
at
ten
cans
set
up
twenty
feet
away
richie
had
gotten
one
out
of
ten
and
his
one
hit
was
really
only
a
nick
ben
had
gotten
two
bill
four
mike
five
beverly
shooting
almost
casually
and
appearing
to
aim
not
at
all
had
banged
nine
of
the
ten
cans
dead
center
the
tenth
fell
over
when
the
rock
she
fired
bounced
off
the
rim
but
first
wwwwe
œ
gotta
make
the
uhuhammo
night
after
next
i
should
be
out
by
the
eddie
said
his
mother
would
protest
that
but
he
didn't
think
she
would
protest
too
much
not
after
this
afternoon
does
your
arm
hurt
beverly
asked
she
was
wearing
a
pink
dress
not
the
dress
he
had
seen
in
his
dream
perhaps
she
had
worn
that
this
afternoon
when
ma
sent
them
away
on
which
she
had
appliquéd
small
flowers
and
silk
or
nylon
hose
she
looked
very
adult
but
also
somehow
very
childlike
like
a
girl
playing
dressup
her
expression
was
dreamy
and
distant
eddie
thought
j
bet
that
how
she
looks
when
she
sleeping
not
too
much
he
said
they
talked
for
awhile
their
voices
punctuated
by
thunder
eddie
did
not
ask
them
about
what
had
happened
when
they
came
to
the
hospital
earlier
that
day
and
none
of
them
mentioned
it
richie
took
out
his
yo
yo
made
it
sleep
once
or
twice
then
put
it
back
conversation
lagged
and
in
one
of
the
pauses
there
was
a
brief
click
that
made
eddie
look
around
bill
had
something
in
his
hand
and
for
a
moment
eddie
felt
his
heart
speed
up
in
alarm
for
that
brief
moment
he
thought
it
was
a
knife
but
then
stan
turned
on
the
room
overhead
dispelling
the
gloom
and
he
saw
it
was
only
a
ballpoint
pen
in
the
light
they
all
looked
natural
again
real
only
his
friends
i
thought
we
ought
to
sign
your
cast
bill
said
his
eyes
met
eddie
squarely
but
that
not
it
eddie
thought
with
sudden
and
alarming
clarity
it
a
contract
it
a
contract
big
bill
isn't
it
or
the
closest
we'll
ever
get
to
one
he
was
frightened
and
then
ashamed
and
angry
at
himself
if
he
had
broken
his
arm
before
this
summer
who
would
have
signed
the
cast
anyone
besides
his
mother
and
perhaps
dr
handor
his
aunts
in
haven
these
were
his
friends
and
his
mother
was
wrong
they
weren't
bad
friends
maybe
he
thought
there
aren't
any
such
things
as
good
friends
or
bad
friends
maybe
there
are
just
friends
people
who
stand
by
you
when
you're
hurt
and
who
kelp
you
feel
not
so
lonely
maybe
they're
always
worth
being
scared
for
and
hoping
for
and
living
for
maybe
worth
dying
for
too
if
that
what
has
to
be
no
good
friends
no
bad
friends
only
people
you
want
need
to
be
with
people
who
build
their
houses
in
your
heart
oka
eddie
said
a
little
hoarsely
okay
that'd
be
real
good
big
bill
so
bill
leaned
solemnly
over
his
bed
and
wrote
his
name
on
the
hillocky
plaster
of
paris
that
encased
eddie
mending
arm
the
letters
large
and
looping
richie
signed
with
a
flourish
ben
handwriting
was
as
narrow
as
he
was
wide
the
letters
slanting
backward
they
looked
ready
to
fall
over
at
the
slightest
push
mike
hanlon
writing
was
large
and
awkward
because
he
was
lefthanded
and
the
angle
was
bad
for
him
he
signed
above
eddie
elbow
and
circled
his
name
when
beverly
bent
over
him
he
could
smell
some
light
flowery
perfume
on
her
she
signed
in
a
round
palmermethod
script
stan
came
last
and
wrote
his
name
in
tight
packed
little
letters
by
eddie
wrist
they
all
stepped
back
then
as
if
aware
of
what
they
had
done
outside
thunder
muttered
heavily
again
lightning
washed
the
hospital
wooden
exterior
in
brief
stuttering
light
that
i
eddie
asked
bill
nodded
cccome
ohohover
to
my
hhouse
aafter
suhhupper
day
aaafter
tomorrow
if
you
cccan
oka
eddie
nodded
and
the
subject
was
closed
there
was
another
period
of
desultory
almost
aimless
conversation
some
of
it
was
about
the
dominant
topic
in
derry
that
july
the
trial
of
richard
macklin
for
the
bludgeon
murder
of
his
stepson
dorsey
and
the
disappearance
of
dorsey
older
brother
eddie
corcoran
macklin
would
not
break
down
and
confess
weeping
on
the
witness
stand
for
another
two
days
but
the
losers
were
in
agreement
that
macklin
probably
had
nothing
to
do
with
eddie
disappearance
the
boy
had
either
run
away
or
it
had
gotten
him
they
left
around
quarter
of
seven
and
the
rain
still
had
not
fallen
it
continued
to
threaten
until
long
after
eddie
ma
had
come
made
her
visit
and
gone
home
again
she
had
been
horrified
at
the
signatures
on
eddie
cast
and
even
more
horrified
at
his
determination
to
leave
the
hospital
the
following
day
she
had
been
envisioning
a
stay
of
a
week
or
more
in
absolute
quiet
so
that
the
ends
of
the
break
could
set
together
as
she
said
eventually
the
stormclouds
broke
apart
and
drifted
away
not
so
much
as
a
drop
of
rain
had
fallen
in
derry
the
humidity
remained
and
people
slept
on
porches
and
on
lawns
and
in
sleeping
bags
in
back
fields
that
night
the
rain
came
the
next
day
not
long
after
beverly
saw
something
terrible
happen
to
patrick
hockstetter
chapter
another
one
of
the
missing
the
death
of
patrick
hockstetter
when
he
finishes
eddie
pours
himself
another
drink
with
a
hand
not
completely
steady
he
looks
at
beverly
and
says
you
saw
it
didn't
you
you
saw
it
take
patrick
hockstetter
the
day
after
you
all
signed
my
cast
the
others
lean
forward
beverly
pushes
her
hair
back
in
a
reddish
cloud
beneath
it
her
face
looks
extraordinarily
pale
she
fumbles
a
fresh
cigarette
out
of
her
pack
the
last
one
and
flicks
her
bic
she
can't
seem
to
guide
the
flame
to
the
tip
of
her
cigarette
after
a
moment
bill
holds
her
wrist
lightly
but
firmly
and
puts
the
flame
where
it
supposed
to
go
beverly
looks
at
him
gratefully
and
exhales
a
cloud
of
bluishgray
smoke
yeah
she
says
i
saw
that
happen
she
shivers
he
was
cruhcruhcraz
bill
says
and
thinks
just
the
fact
that
henry
let
a
flako
like
patrick
hockstetter
hang
around
as
that
summer
wore
on
that
says
something
doesn't
it
either
that
henry
was
losing
some
of
his
charm
some
of
his
attraction
or
that
henry
own
craziness
had
progressed
far
enough
so
that
the
hockstetter
kid
seemed
okay
to
him
both
came
to
the
same
thing
henry
increasing
what
degeneration
is
that
the
word
yes
in
light
of
what
happened
to
him
where
he
ended
up
i
think
it
is
there
something
else
to
support
the
idea
too
bill
thinks
but
as
yet
he
can
only
remember
it
vaguely
he
and
richie
and
beverly
had
been
down
at
tracker
brothers
early
august
by
then
and
the
summerschool
that
had
kept
henry
out
of
their
hair
for
most
of
the
summer
was
just
about
to
end
and
hadn't
victor
criss
approached
them
a
very
frightened
victor
criss
yes
that
had
happened
things
had
been
rapidly
approaching
the
end
by
then
and
bill
thinks
now
that
every
kid
in
derry
had
sensed
it
the
losers
and
henry
group
most
of
all
but
that
had
been
later
oh
yeah
you
got
that
right
beverly
says
flatly
patrick
hockstetter
was
crazy
none
of
the
girls
would
sit
in
front
of
him
in
school
you'd
be
sitting
there
doing
your
arithmetic
or
writing
a
story
or
a
composition
and
all
at
once
you'd
feel
this
hand
almost
as
light
as
a
feather
but
warm
and
sweaty
meaty
she
swallows
and
there
is
a
small
click
in
her
throat
the
others
watch
her
solemnly
from
around
the
table
you'd
feel
it
on
your
side
or
maybe
on
your
breast
not
that
any
of
us
had
much
in
the
way
of
breasts
back
then
but
patrick
didn't
seem
to
care
about
that
you'd
feel
that
that
touch
and
you'd
jerk
away
from
it
and
turn
around
and
there
patrick
would
be
grinning
with
those
big
rubbery
lips
he
had
a
pencilbox
full
of
flies
richie
says
suddenly
sure
he'd
kill
em
with
this
green
ruler
he
had
and
then
put
em
in
his
pencilbox
i
even
remember
what
it
looked
like
red
with
a
wavy
white
plastic
cover
that
slid
open
and
closed
eddie
is
nodding
you'd
jerk
away
and
he'd
grin
and
then
maybe
he'd
open
his
pencilbox
so
you
could
see
the
dead
flies
inside
beverly
says
and
the
worst
thingthe
horrible
thing
was
the
way
he'd
smile
and
never
say
anything
mrs
douglas
knew
greta
bowie
told
on
him
and
i
think
sally
mueller
said
something
once
too
but
i
think
mrs
douglas
was
scared
of
him
too
ben
has
rocked
back
on
the
rear
legs
of
his
chair
and
his
hands
are
laced
behind
his
neck
she
still
cannot
believe
how
lean
he
is
i'm
pretty
sure
you're
righ
he
says
whwhat
hhappened
to
hhhim
beverly
bill
asks
she
swallows
again
trying
to
fight
off
the
nightmarish
power
of
what
she
saw
that
day
in
the
barrens
her
roller
skates
tied
together
and
hung
over
her
shoulder
one
knee
a
stinging
net
of
pain
from
a
fall
she
had
taken
on
saint
crispin
lane
another
of
the
short
treelined
streets
that
deadended
where
the
land
fell
and
still
falls
sharply
into
the
barrens
she
remembers
oh
these
memories
when
they
come
are
so
clear
and
so
powerful
that
she
was
wearing
a
pair
of
denim
shorts
really
too
short
they
came
only
to
just
below
the
hem
of
her
panties
she
had
become
more
conscious
of
her
body
over
the
last
year
over
the
last
six
months
actually
as
it
began
to
curve
and
become
more
womanly
the
mirror
was
one
reason
for
this
heightened
consciousness
of
course
but
not
the
main
one
the
main
one
was
that
her
father
seemed
even
sharper
just
lately
more
apt
to
use
his
slapping
hand
or
even
his
fists
he
seemed
restless
almost
caged
and
she
was
more
and
more
nervous
when
she
was
around
him
more
and
more
on
her
mark
it
was
as
if
there
was
a
smell
they
made
between
them
a
smell
that
wasn't
there
when
she
was
in
the
apartment
alone
one
that
had
never
been
there
when
they
were
in
it
together
not
until
this
summer
and
when
mom
was
gone
it
was
worse
if
there
was
a
smell
some
smell
then
he
knew
it
too
maybe
because
bev
saw
less
and
less
of
him
as
the
hot
weather
wore
on
partly
because
of
his
summer
bowling
league
partly
because
he
was
helping
his
friend
joe
tammerly
fix
cars
but
she
suspects
it
was
partly
that
smell
the
one
they
made
between
them
neither
of
them
meaning
to
but
mak
ing
it
just
the
same
as
helpless
to
stop
it
as
either
was
helpless
to
stop
sweating
in
july
the
vision
of
the
birds
hundreds
and
thousands
of
them
descending
on
the
roofpeaks
of
houses
on
telephone
wires
on
tv
aerials
intervenes
again
and
poison
iv
she
says
aloud
ww
what
bill
asks
something
about
poison
iv
she
says
slowly
looking
at
him
but
it
wasn't
it
just
felt
like
poison
ivy
mike
'
never
min
mike
says
tt
will
come
tell
us
what
you
do
remember
bev
i
remember
the
blue
shorts
she
would
tell
them
and
how
faded
they
were
getting
how
tight
around
my
hips
and
butt
i
had
half
a
pack
of
lucky
strikes
in
one
pocket
and
the
bullseye
in
the
other
do
you
remember
the
bullseye
'
she
asks
richie
but
they
all
nod
bill
gave
it
to
m
she
says
i
didn't
want
it
but
it
he
she
smiles
at
bill
a
little
wanly
you
couldn't
say
no
to
big
bill
that
was
all
so
i
had
it
and
that
why
i
was
out
by
myself
that
day
to
practice
i
still
didn't
think
i'd
have
the
guts
to
use
it
when
the
time
came
except
i
used
it
that
day
i
had
to
i
killed
one
of
them
one
of
the
parts
of
it
it
was
terrible
even
now
it
hard
for
me
to
think
of
and
one
of
the
others
got
me
look
she
raises
her
arm
and
turns
it
over
so
they
can
all
see
a
puckery
scar
on
the
roundest
part
of
her
upper
forearm
it
looks
as
if
a
hot
circular
object
about
the
size
of
a
havana
cigar
had
been
pressed
against
her
skin
it
is
slightly
sunken
and
looking
at
it
gives
mike
hanlon
a
chill
this
is
one
of
the
parts
of
the
story
which
like
eddie
unwilling
hearttoheart
with
keene
he
has
suspected
but
never
actually
heard
you
were
right
about
one
thing
richie
she
says
that
bullseye
was
a
killer
i
was
scared
of
it
but
i
sorta
loved
it
too
richie
laughs
and
claps
her
on
the
back
shit
i
knew
that
back
then
you
stupid
skirt
you
did
really
'
yeah
reall
he
says
tt
was
something
in
your
eyes
bevvie
mean
it
looked
like
a
toy
but
it
was
real
you
could
blow
holes
in
things
and
you
blew
a
hole
in
something
with
it
that
da
ben
muses
she
nods
was
it
patrick
you
no
god
n
beverly
says
it
was
the
other
wait
she
crushes
out
her
cigarette
sips
her
drink
and
gets
herself
under
control
again
finally
she
is
well
no
but
she
has
a
feeling
it
the
closest
she
going
to
get
tonight
i
was
rollerskating
you
see
and
i
fell
down
and
gave
myself
a
good
scrape
then
i
decided
i'd
go
down
to
the
barrens
and
practice
i
went
by
the
clubhouse
first
to
see
if
you
guys
were
there
you
weren't
just
that
smoky
smell
you
guys
remember
how
long
that
place
went
on
smelling
of
smoke
'
they
all
nod
smiling
we
never
really
did
get
the
smell
out
did
w
ben
says
so
then
i
headed
down
to
the
dum
she
says
because
that
where
we
had
the
the
tryouts
i
guess
you'd
call
them
and
i
knew
there'd
be
lots
of
things
to
shoot
at
maybe
even
you
know
rats
she
pauses
there
a
fine
misty
sweat
on
her
forehead
now
that
what
i
really
wanted
to
shoot
a
she
says
finally
something
that
was
alive
not
a
seagull
i
knew
i
couldn't
shoot
a
gull
but
a
rat
i
wanted
to
see
if
i
could
t'm
glad
i
came
from
the
kansas
street
side
instead
of
the
old
cape
side
though
because
there
wasn't
much
cover
over
there
by
the
railroad
embankment
they
would
have
seen
me
and
god
knows
what
would
have
happened
then
who
would
have
suhsuhseen
yyo
them
beverly
says
henry
bowers
victor
criss
belch
huggins
and
patrick
hockstetter
they
were
down
in
the
dump
and
suddenly
amazing
all
of
them
she
begins
to
giggle
like
a
child
her
cheeks
turning
rose
red
she
giggles
until
tears
stand
in
her
eyes
what
the
hell
be
rickie
says
let
us
in
on
the
joke
oh
it
was
a
joke
all
righ
she
says
it
was
a
joke
but
i
think
they
might
have
killed
me
if
they
knew
i'd
seen
remember
now
ben
cries
and
he
begins
to
laugh
too
i
remember
you
telling
u
giggling
wildly
beverly
says
they
had
their
pants
down
and
they
were
lighting
farts
there
is
an
instant
of
thunderstruck
silence
and
then
they
all
begin
to
laugh
the
sound
echoes
through
the
library
thinking
of
exactly
how
to
tell
them
of
patrick
hockstetter
death
the
thing
she
fixes
on
first
is
how
approaching
the
town
dump
from
the
kansas
street
side
was
like
entering
some
weird
asteroid
belt
there
was
a
rutted
din
track
a
town
road
actually
it
even
had
a
name
old
lyme
street
that
ran
from
kansas
street
to
the
dump
the
only
actual
road
into
the
barrens
the
city
dump
trucks
used
it
beverly
walked
near
old
lyme
street
but
didn't
take
it
she
had
grown
more
cautious
she
supposed
all
of
them
had
since
eddie
arm
had
been
broken
especially
when
she
was
alone
she
wove
her
way
through
the
heavy
undergrowth
skirting
a
patch
of
poison
ivy
with
its
reddish
oily
leaves
smelling
the
dump
smoky
rot
hearing
the
seagulls
on
her
left
through
occasional
breaks
in
the
foliage
she
could
see
old
lyme
street
the
others
are
looking
at
her
waiting
she
checks
her
cigarette
pack
and
finds
it
empty
wordlessly
richie
tosses
her
one
of
his
she
lights
up
looks
around
at
them
and
says
heading
toward
the
dump
from
the
kansas
street
side
was
a
little
like
entering
some
weird
asteroid
belt
the
dumpoid
belt
at
first
there
was
nothing
but
the
underbrush
growing
from
the
spongy
ground
underfoot
and
then
you
would
see
your
first
dumpoid
a
rusty
can
that
had
once
contained
prince
spaghetti
sauce
maybe
or
an
s
ok
sodabottle
crawling
with
bugs
attracted
by
the
sweetsticky
remains
of
cream
soda
or
birch
beer
then
there
would
be
abright
wink
of
sun
kicking
off
a
scrap
of
tinfoil
caught
in
a
tree
you
might
see
a
bedspring
or
trip
over
it
if
you
weren't
watching
where
you
were
going
or
a
bone
some
dog
had
carried
away
gnawed
dropped
the
dump
itself
wasn't
so
bad
was
in
fact
sort
of
interesting
beverly
thought
what
was
nasty
and
sort
of
creepy
was
the
way
it
had
of
spreading
of
creating
this
dumpoid
belt
she
was
getting
closer
now
the
trees
were
bigger
mostly
firs
and
the
bushes
were
thinning
out
the
gulls
cheeped
and
cried
in
their
shrill
querulous
voices
and
the
air
was
smudgy
with
the
smell
of
burning
now
on
beverly
right
leaning
at
an
angle
against
the
base
of
a
spruce
tree
was
a
rusty
amana
refrigerator
beverly
glanced
at
it
thinking
vaguely
of
the
state
policeman
who
had
visited
her
class
when
she
had
been
in
the
third
grade
he
had
told
them
that
such
things
as
discarded
refrigerators
were
dangerous
a
kid
could
climb
into
one
while
playing
hideand
goseek
for
instance
and
smother
to
death
inside
although
why
anyone
would
want
to
get
in
a
scroungy
old
she
heard
a
shout
so
close
it
made
her
jump
followed
by
laughter
beverly
grinned
so
they
were
here
they
had
left
the
clubhouse
because
of
the
smoky
smell
and
had
come
down
here
they
were
maybe
breaking
bottles
with
rocks
maybe
just
dump
picking
she
began
to
walk
a
little
faster
the
nasty
scrape
she
had
gotten
earlier
now
forgotten
in
her
eagerness
to
see
them
to
see
him
with
his
red
hair
so
much
like
hers
to
see
if
he
would
smile
at
her
in
that
oddly
endearing
onesided
way
of
his
she
knew
she
was
too
young
to
love
a
boy
too
young
to
have
anything
but
crushes
but
she
loved
bill
just
the
same
and
she
walked
a
little
faster
her
skates
swinging
heavily
from
her
shoulder
the
sling
of
his
bullseye
beating
soft
time
against
her
left
buttock
she
almost
walked
into
them
before
realizing
it
wasn't
her
gang
at
all
but
bowers
she
walked
out
of
the
screening
bushes
and
the
dump
steepest
side
lay
about
seventy
yards
ahead
a
twinkling
avalanche
of
junk
lying
along
the
high
angle
of
the
gravelpit
mandy
fazio
bulldozer
was
off
to
the
left
much
closer
in
front
of
her
was
a
wilderness
of
junked
cars
at
the
end
of
each
month
these
were
crushed
and
hauled
off
to
portland
for
scrap
but
now
there
were
a
dozen
or
more
some
sitting
on
bare
wheelrims
some
on
their
sides
one
or
two
lying
on
their
roofs
like
dead
dogs
they
were
arranged
in
two
rows
and
beverly
walked
down
the
rough
trashlittered
aisle
between
them
like
some
punk
bride
of
the
future
wondering
idly
if
she
could
break
a
windshield
with
the
bullseye
one
of
the
pockets
of
her
blue
shorts
bulged
with
the
small
ball
bearings
that
were
her
practice
ammo
the
voices
and
laughter
were
coming
fom
beyond
the
junkedout
cars
and
to
the
left
at
the
edge
of
the
dump
proper
beverly
rounded
the
last
one
a
studebaker
with
its
entire
front
end
missing
her
hail
of
greeting
died
on
her
lips
the
hand
she
had
put
up
to
wave
did
not
exactly
fail
back
to
her
side
it
seemed
to
wilt
her
first
furiously
embarrassed
thought
was
oh
dear
god
why
are
they
all
naked
this
was
followed
by
the
scary
realization
of
who
they
were
she
froze
there
in
front
of
the
half
studebaker
with
her
shadow
stapled
to
the
heels
of
her
lowtopped
sneakers
for
that
one
moment
she
was
totally
visible
to
them
if
any
of
the
four
had
looked
up
from
the
circle
they
were
squatting
in
he
could
not
have
missed
her
a
girl
of
slightly
more
than
medium
height
a
pair
of
skates
over
one
shoulder
the
knee
of
one
long
coltish
leg
still
oozing
blood
her
mouth
slackjawed
her
cheeks
scarlet
before
darting
back
behind
the
studebaker
she
saw
that
they
weren't
entirely
naked
after
all
they
had
their
shirts
on
and
their
pants
ad
underpants
were
simply
pulled
down
to
their
shoetops
as
if
they
had
to
go
number
two
in
her
shock
beverly
mind
had
automatically
reverted
to
the
euphemism
she
had
been
taught
as
a
toddler
except
whoever
heard
of
four
boys
going
number
two
at
the
same
time
once
out
of
sight
again
her
first
thought
was
to
get
away
get
away
fast
her
heart
was
pumping
hard
her
muscles
heavy
with
adrenaline
she
looked
around
seeing
what
she
hadn't
bothered
to
notice
walking
up
here
when
she
had
thought
the
voices
she
heard
belonged
to
her
friends
the
row
of
junked
cars
on
her
left
was
really
pretty
thin
they
were
by
no
means
packed
in
door
to
door
as
they
would
be
in
the
week
or
so
before
the
crusher
came
to
turn
them
into
rough
blocks
of
twinkling
metal
she
had
been
exposed
to
the
boys
several
times
walking
up
to
where
she
was
now
if
she
retreated
she
would
be
exposed
again
and
this
time
she
might
be
seen
also
she
felt
a
certain
shameful
curiosity
what
in
the
world
could
they
be
doing
carefully
she
peeked
around
the
studebaker
henry
and
victor
criss
were
more
or
less
facing
in
her
direction
patrick
hockstetter
was
on
henry
left
belch
huggins
had
his
back
to
her
she
observed
the
fact
that
belch
had
an
extremely
large
extremely
hairy
ass
and
halfhysterical
giggles
suddenly
bubbled
up
her
throat
like
the
head
on
a
glass
of
ginger
ale
she
had
to
clap
both
hands
over
her
mouth
and
withdraw
behind
the
studebaker
again
struggling
to
hold
the
giggles
in
you've
got
to
get
out
of
here
beverly
if
they
catch
you
she
looked
back
down
between
the
junked
cars
still
holding
her
hands
over
her
mouth
the
aisle
was
maybe
ten
feet
wide
littered
with
cans
twinkling
with
little
jigsaw
pieces
of
saftglas
scruffy
with
weeds
if
she
so
much
as
made
a
sound
they
might
hear
her
particularly
if
their
absorption
in
whatever
strange
thing
they
were
doing
flagged
when
she
thought
of
how
casually
she
had
walked
up
here
her
blood
ran
cold
also
what
in
the
world
can
they
be
doing
she
peeked
again
seeing
more
of
the
details
this
time
there
was
a
careless
scatter
of
books
and
papers
nearby
schoolbooks
they
had
just
come
from
their
summer
classes
then
what
most
of
the
kids
called
dummy
school
or
makeup
school
and
because
henry
and
victor
were
facing
her
way
she
could
see
their
things
they
were
the
first
things
she
had
ever
seen
in
her
life
other
than
pictures
in
a
smudgy
little
book
that
brenda
arrowsmith
had
showed
her
the
year
before
and
in
those
pictures
you
really
couldn't
see
very
much
bev
observed
now
that
their
things
were
little
tubes
that
hung
down
between
their
legs
henry
was
small
and
hairless
but
victor
was
quite
big
and
there
was
a
cloudy
fuzz
of
fine
black
hair
just
over
it
bill
has
one
of
those
she
thought
and
suddenly
her
whole
body
seemed
to
flush
at
once
heat
rushed
through
her
in
a
wave
that
made
her
feel
giddy
and
faint
and
almost
sick
to
her
stomach
in
that
moment
she
felt
much
the
way
ben
hanscom
had
felt
on
the
last
day
of
school
looking
down
at
her
ankle
bracelet
and
observing
the
way
it
flashed
in
the
sun
but
he
had
not
felt
the
intermixed
sense
of
terror
she
felt
now
she
looked
behind
her
once
more
now
the
pathway
between
the
cars
leading
to
the
shelter
of
the
barrens
seemed
much
longer
she
was
scared
to
move
if
they
knew
she
had
seen
their
things
they
would
probably
hurt
her
and
not
just
a
little
they
would
hurt
her
badly
belch
huggins
bellowed
suddenly
making
her
jump
and
henry
yelled
three
feet
no
shit
belch
it
was
three
feet
wasn't
it
vie
vie
agreed
it
was
and
they
all
roared
with
troll
like
laughter
beverly
tried
another
look
around
the
junked
studebaker
patrick
hockstetter
had
turned
and
halfrisen
so
that
his
butt
was
nearly
in
henry
face
in
henry
hand
was
a
silvery
glinting
object
after
a
moment
study
she
made
it
out
as
a
lighter
i
thought
you
said
you
felt
one
coming
o
henry
said
i
do
patrick
said
i'll
tell
you
when
get
ready
get
ready
it
coming
get
now
henry
flicked
the
lighter
at
the
same
moment
there
was
the
unmistakable
ripping
sound
of
a
really
good
fart
there
was
no
mistaking
that
sound
beverly
had
heard
it
enough
in
her
own
house
usually
on
saturday
night
after
the
beans
and
franks
a
regular
bear
for
his
beans
was
her
father
as
patrick
blew
off
and
henry
flicked
the
lighter
she
saw
something
that
made
her
jaw
drop
a
bright
blue
jet
of
flame
appeared
to
roar
directly
out
of
patrick
bum
to
bev
looked
like
the
pilot
light
on
a
gasburner
the
boys
roared
their
trolllike
laughter
and
beverly
withdrew
behind
the
sheltering
car
stifling
mad
giggles
again
she
was
laughing
but
not
because
she
was
amused
in
some
very
weird
way
it
was
funny
yes
but
mostly
she
was
laughing
because
she
felt
a
deep
revulsion
accompanied
by
a
sort
of
horror
she
was
laughing
because
she
knew
of
no
other
way
to
cope
with
what
she
had
seen
it
had
something
to
do
with
seeing
the
boy
things
but
that
was
by
no
means
all
or
even
the
great
part
of
what
she
felt
she
had
known
after
all
that
boys
had
things
the
same
way
she
knew
that
girls
had
different
things
this
was
only
what
you
might
call
a
confirmed
sighting
but
the
rest
of
what
they
were
doing
seemed
so
strange
so
ludicrous
and
yet
at
the
same
time
so
deadlyprimitive
that
she
found
herself
in
spite
of
the
giggling
fit
groping
for
the
core
of
herself
with
some
desperation
stop
she
thought
as
if
this
were
the
answer
stop
they'll
hear
you
so
just
you
stop
it
bevvie
but
that
was
impossible
the
best
she
could
do
was
to
laugh
without
engaging
her
vocal
cords
so
that
the
sounds
came
out
of
her
in
a
series
of
almost
inaudible
chuffs
her
hands
pasted
over
her
mouth
her
cheeks
as
red
as
mac
apples
her
eyes
swimming
with
tears
holy
skit
that
hurts
victor
roared
twelve
feet
henry
bellowed
i
swear
to
god
vie
twelve
fuckin
feet
i
swear
it
on
my
mother
name”
don't
care
if
it
was
twenty
fuckin
feet
you
burned
my
ass
off
victor
howled
and
there
was
more
bellowing
laughter
still
trying
to
giggle
silently
from
behind
the
sheltering
car
beverly
thought
of
a
movie
she
had
seen
on
tv
jon
hall
had
been
in
it
it
was
about
this
jungle
tribe
they
had
a
secret
rite
and
f
you
saw
it
you
got
sacrificed
to
their
god
which
was
this
big
stone
idol
this
did
not
stop
her
giggles
but
infused
them
with
a
nearly
frantic
quality
they
were
becoming
more
and
more
like
silent
screams
her
belly
hurt
tears
streamed
down
her
face
henry
victor
belch
and
patrick
hockstetter
ended
up
in
the
dump
lighting
each
others
farts
on
that
hot
july
afternoon
because
of
rena
davenport
henry
knew
what
resulted
from
consuming
large
amounts
of
baked
beans
this
result
was
perhaps
best
expressed
in
a
little
ditty
he
had
learned
at
his
father
knee
when
he
was
still
in
short
pants
beans
beans
the
musical
fruit
the
more
you
eat
the
more
you
toot
the
more
you
toot
the
better
you
feel
then
you're
ready
for
another
meal
rena
davenport
and
his
father
had
been
courting
for
nearly
eight
years
she
was
fat
forty
and
usually
filthy
henry
supposed
that
rena
and
his
father
sometimes
fucked
although
he
could
not
imagine
anyone
squashing
his
body
down
on
rena
davenport
rena
beans
were
her
pride
she
soaked
them
saturday
nights
and
baked
them
over
a
slow
fire
all
day
sunday
henry
supposed
they
were
okay
they
were
something
to
shovel
into
your
mouth
and
chew
up
anyway
but
after
eight
years
anything
lost
its
charm
nor
was
rena
content
to
make
just
a
few
beans
she
cooked
them
in
job
lots
when
she
turned
up
sunday
evenings
in
her
old
green
de
soto
a
naked
rubber
babydoll
hung
from
the
rearview
mirror
looking
like
the
world
youngest
lynchmob
victim
she
usually
had
the
bowerse
beans
steaming
on
the
seat
beside
her
in
a
twelvegallon
galvanizedsteel
pail
the
three
of
them
would
eat
the
beans
that
night
rena
raving
about
her
own
cooking
all
the
while
crazy
butch
bowers
grunting
and
mopping
up
bean
juice
with
a
piece
of
sonny
boy
bread
or
simply
telling
her
to
shut
up
if
there
was
a
ballgame
on
the
radio
henry
just
eating
staring
out
the
window
thinking
his
own
thoughts
it
was
over
a
plate
of
sundaynight
beans
that
he
had
conceived
the
idea
of
poisoning
mike
hanlon
dog
mr
chips
and
butch
would
reheat
a
mess
of
them
the
next
night
on
tuesdays
and
wednesdays
henry
would
take
a
tupperware
box
full
of
them
to
school
by
thursday
or
friday
neither
henry
or
his
father
could
eat
any
more
the
house
two
bedrooms
would
smell
of
stale
farts
in
spite
of
the
open
windows
butch
would
take
the
remains
and
mix
them
into
the
other
slops
and
feed
them
to
bip
and
bop
the
bowerse
two
pigs
rena
would
like
as
not
show
up
the
following
sunday
with
another
steaming
pail
and
the
cycle
would
start
all
over
again
that
morning
henry
had
put
up
an
enormous
quantity
of
leftover
beans
and
the
four
of
them
had
eaten
the
whole
lot
at
noon
sitting
out
on
the
playground
in
the
shade
of
a
big
old
elm
they
had
eaten
until
they
were
nearly
bursting
it
had
been
patrick
who
suggested
they
go
down
to
the
dump
which
would
be
fairly
quiet
in
the
middle
of
a
workingday
summer
afternoon
by
the
time
they
arrived
the
beans
were
doing
their
work
quite
nicely
little
by
little
beverly
got
herself
under
control
again
she
knew
she
had
to
get
out
beating
a
retreat
was
ultimately
less
dangerous
than
hanging
around
they
were
absorbed
in
what
they
were
doing
and
even
if
worse
came
to
worst
she
could
get
a
headstart
and
in
the
back
of
her
mind
she
had
also
decided
that
if
worst
came
to
terrible
a
few
shots
from
the
bullseye
might
discourage
them
she
was
about
to
begin
creeping
away
when
victor
said
i
gotta
go
henry
my
dad
wants
me
to
help
him
pick
com
this
afternoon
oh
shit
henry
said
he'll
live
no
he
mad
at
me
because
of
what
happened
the
other
day
fuck
him
if
he
can't
take
a
joke
beverly
listened
more
closely
now
suspecting
it
might
be
the
scuffle
which
had
ended
with
eddie
broken
arm
that
they
were
talking
about
no
i
gotta
go
i
think
his
ass
hurt
patrick
said
watch
your
mouth
fuckface
victor
said
it
might
grow
on
you
i
got
to
go
too
belch
said
your
father
want
you
to
pick
corn
henry
asked
angrily
this
was
what
might
have
passed
for
a
jest
in
henry
mind
belch
father
was
dead
no
but
i
got
a
job
delivering
the
weekly
shopper
i
gotta
do
that
tonight
what
this
weekly
shopper
crap
henry
asked
now
sounding
upset
as
well
as
angry
it
ajo
belch
said
with
ponderous
patience
i
make
money
henry
made
a
disgusted
sound
and
beverly
risked
another
peek
around
the
car
victor
and
belch
were
standing
buckling
their
belts
henry
and
patrick
were
still
squatting
with
their
pants
down
the
lighter
glinted
in
henry
hand
you're
not
chickening
out
are
you
henry
asked
patrick
nope
patrick
said
you
don't
have
to
pick
corn
or
go
do
some
pussy
job
nope
patrick
said
again
wel
belch
said
uncertainly
see
you
around
henry
sure
henry
said
and
spat
near
one
of
belch
clodhopping
workshoes
vie
and
belch
started
off
together
toward
the
two
rows
of
wrecked
cars
toward
the
studebaker
behind
which
beverly
was
crouching
at
first
she
could
only
cringe
frozen
with
fear
like
a
rabbit
then
she
slid
around
the
left
side
of
the
studebaker
and
backed
down
the
gap
between
it
and
the
battered
doorless
ford
next
to
it
for
a
moment
she
paused
looking
from
side
to
side
hearing
them
approach
she
hesitated
her
mouth
cottonydry
her
back
itchy
with
sweat
a
part
of
her
mind
was
numbly
wondering
how
she'd
lookin
a
cast
like
eddie
with
the
loser
names
signed
on
it
then
she
dived
into
the
ford
on
the
passenger
side
she
curled
up
on
the
filthy
floormat
making
herself
as
small
as
possible
it
was
boiling
hot
inside
the
junkedout
ford
and
it
smelled
so
thickly
of
dust
rotting
upholstery
and
elderly
ratcrap
that
she
had
to
struggle
grimly
to
keep
from
sneezing
or
coughing
she
heard
belch
and
victor
pass
close
by
talking
in
low
voices
then
they
were
gone
she
sneezed
three
times
quickly
and
quietly
into
her
cupped
hands
she
supposed
she
could
go
now
if
she
was
careful
the
best
way
to
do
it
would
be
to
shift
over
to
the
driver
side
of
the
ford
sneak
back
to
the
aisle
and
then
just
do
a
fade
she
believed
she
could
manage
it
but
the
shock
of
almost
being
discovered
had
robbed
her
of
her
courage
at
least
for
the
time
being
she
felt
safer
here
in
the
ford
and
maybe
now
that
victor
and
belch
had
gone
the
other
two
would
also
go
soon
then
she
could
go
back
to
the
clubhouse
she
had
lost
all
interest
in
target
shooting
also
she
had
to
pee
come
on
she
thought
come
on
hurry
up
and
go
hurry
up
and
go
puhleeze
a
moment
later
she
heard
patrick
roar
with
mixed
laughter
and
pain
six
feet
henry
bellowed
just
like
a
fuckin
blowtorch
swear
to
go
silence
then
for
awhile
sweat
trickling
down
her
back
the
sun
beating
hrough
the
ford
cracked
windshield
on
the
nape
of
her
neck
heaviness
in
her
bladder
henry
bellowed
so
loud
that
beverly
who
had
been
close
to
dozing
in
spite
of
her
discomfort
almost
cried
out
herself
damn
it
hockstetter
you
burned
my
frigging
ass
what
are
you
doing
with
that
lighter
ten
feet
patrick
giggled
just
the
sound
of
it
made
bev
feel
cold
and
revolted
as
if
she
had
seen
a
worm
squirm
its
way
out
of
her
salad
ten
feet
if
it
was
an
inch
henry
bright
blue
ten
feet
if
it
was
an
inch
swear
to
go
gimme
that
henry
grunted
come
on
come
on
you
stupidniks
go
get
out
when
patrick
spoke
again
his
voice
was
so
low
bev
could
barely
hear
it
if
there
had
been
the
slightest
breath
of
wind
on
the
air
that
bakng
afternoon
she
would
not
have
done
let
me
show
you
something
patrick
said
wha
henry
asked
just
something
patrick
paused
it
feels
good
what
henry
asked
again
then
there
was
silence
i
don't
want
to
look
i
don't
want
to
see
what
they're
doing
now
and
besides
they
might
see
me
in
fact
they
probably
will
because
you've
used
up
all
your
luck
today
girlyo
so
just
stay
right
here
no
peeking
but
her
curiosity
had
overcome
her
good
sense
there
was
something
strange
in
that
silence
something
a
little
bit
scary
she
raised
her
head
inch
by
inch
until
she
could
look
through
the
ford
cracked
cloudy
windshield
she
needn't
have
worried
about
being
seen
both
of
the
boys
were
concentrating
on
what
patrick
was
doing
she
didn't
understand
what
she
was
seeing
but
she
knew
it
was
nasty
not
that
she
would
have
expected
anything
else
from
patrick
who
was
just
so
weird
he
had
one
hand
between
henry
thighs
and
one
hand
between
his
own
one
hand
vas
flogging
henry
thing
gently
with
his
other
hand
patrick
was
rubbing
his
own
except
he
wasn't
exactly
rubbing
it
he
was
kind
of
squeezing
it
pulling
it
letting
it
flop
back
down
what
is
he
doing
beverly
wondered
dismayed
she
didn't
know
not
for
sure
but
it
scared
her
she
didn't
think
she
had
been
this
scared
since
the
blood
had
vomited
out
of
the
bathroom
drain
and
splattered
all
over
everything
some
deep
part
of
her
cried
out
that
if
they
discovered
she
had
seen
this
whatever
it
was
they
might
do
more
than
hurt
her
they
might
actually
kill
her
still
she
couldn't
look
away
she
saw
that
patrick
thing
had
gotten
a
little
longer
but
not
much
it
still
dangled
between
his
legs
like
a
snake
with
no
backbone
henry
however
had
grown
amazingly
it
stood
up
stiff
and
hard
almost
poking
his
bellybutton
patrick
hand
went
up
and
down
up
and
down
sometimes
pausing
to
squeeze
sometimes
tickling
that
odd
heavy
sac
under
henry
thing
those
are
his
balls
beverly
thought
do
boys
have
to
go
around
with
those
all
the
time
god
i'd
go
crazy
another
part
of
her
mind
then
whispered
bill
has
those
on
its
own
her
mind
visualized
her
holding
them
cupping
them
in
her
hand
testing
their
texture
and
that
hot
feeling
raced
through
her
again
sparking
off
a
furious
blush
henry
stared
at
patrick
hand
as
if
hypnotized
his
lighter
lay
on
the
rocky
scree
beside
him
reflecting
hot
afternoon
sun
want
me
to
put
it
in
my
mouth
patrick
asked
his
big
livery
lips
smiled
complacently
huh
henry
asked
as
if
startled
from
some
deep
dream
til
put
it
in
my
mouth
if
you
want
i
don't
m
henry
hand
flashed
out
halfcurled
not
quite
a
fist
patrick
was
knocked
sprawling
his
head
thudded
on
the
gravel
beverly
dived
down
again
her
heart
crashing
in
her
chest
her
teeth
locked
against
a
little
whimpering
moan
after
knocking
patrick
down
henry
had
turned
and
for
a
moment
just
before
she
dropped
back
into
her
little
huddled
ball
on
the
passenger
side
of
the
driveshaft
hump
it
seemed
that
her
eyes
and
henry
had
locked
please
god
the
sun
was
in
his
eyes
she
prayed
please
god
i'm
sorry
i
peeked
please
god
there
was
an
agonizing
pause
then
her
white
blouse
was
plastered
to
her
body
with
sweat
droplets
like
seed
pearls
gleamed
on
her
tanned
arms
her
bladder
throbbed
painfully
she
felt
that
very
soon
she
would
wet
her
pants
she
waited
for
henry
furious
crazy
face
to
appear
in
the
opening
where
the
ford
passenger
door
had
teen
sure
it
was
going
to
happen
how
could
he
have
missed
seeing
her
he
would
drag
her
out
and
hurt
her
he
would
a
new
and
even
more
terrible
thought
now
occurred
to
her
and
once
again
she
had
to
engage
in
a
painful
crampy
struggle
to
keep
from
wetting
her
pants
suppose
he
did
something
to
her
with
his
thing
suppose
he
wanted
her
to
put
it
in
her
somewhere
she
knew
where
it
was
supposed
to
go
all
right
it
seemed
that
knowledge
had
suddenly
sprung
into
her
mind
fullblown
she
thought
that
if
henry
tried
to
put
his
thing
in
her
she
would
go
crazy
please
no
please
god
don't
let
him
have
seen
me
please
okay
then
henry
spoke
and
to
her
growing
horror
his
voice
was
coming
from
someplace
much
closer
i
don't
go
for
that
queer
stuff
from
farther
off
patrick
voice
you
liked
it
i
didn't
like
i
henry
shouted
and
if
you
tell
anyone
i
did
i'll
kill
you
you
fucking
little
pansy
you
got
a
boner
patrick
said
he
sounded
like
he
was
smiling
as
much
as
she
feared
henry
bowers
the
smile
would
not
have
surprised
beverly
patrick
was
crazy
crazier
than
henry
maybe
and
people
that
crazy
weren't
afraid
of
anything
i
saw
it
footsteps
crunched
over
the
gravel
closer
and
closer
beverly
looked
up
her
eyes
bulging
through
the
ford
old
windshield
she
could
now
see
the
back
of
henry
head
he
was
looking
toward
patrick
now
but
if
he
turned
around
if
you
tell
anyone
i'll
say
you're
a
cocksucker
henry
said
then
i'll
kill
you
you
don't
scare
me
henry
patrick
said
and
giggled
but
i
might
not
tell
if
you
gave
me
a
dollar
henry
shifted
restlessly
he
turned
slightly
beverly
could
now
see
onequarter
of
his
profile
instead
of
just
the
back
of
his
head
please
god
please
god
she
begged
incoherently
and
her
bladder
throbbed
more
strongly
if
you
tell
henry
said
his
voice
low
and
deliberate
til
tell
what
you've
been
doing
with
the
cats
with
the
dogs
too
i'll
tell
them
about
your
refrigerator
you
know
what'll
happen
hockstetter
they'll
come
and
take
you
away
and
put
you
into
the
fuckinga
loonybin
silence
from
patrick
henry
drummed
his
fingers
on
the
hood
of
the
ford
beverly
was
hiding
in
do
you
hear
me
hear
you
patrick
sounded
sullen
now
mullen
and
a
little
scared
he
burst
out
you
liked
it
you
got
a
boner
biggest
boner
i
ever
sa
yeah
i
bet
you
seen
a
lot
of
em
you
fuckin
little
homo
faggot
you
just
remember
what
i
said
about
the
refrigerator
your
refrigerator
and
if
i
see
you
around
again
i'll
knock
your
block
off
more
silence
from
patrick
henry
moved
away
beverly
turned
her
head
and
saw
him
pass
by
the
driver
side
of
the
ford
if
he
had
looked
to
his
left
even
a
little
bit
he
would
have
seen
her
but
he
didn't
look
a
moment
later
she
heard
him
heading
off
the
way
victor
and
belch
had
gone
now
there
was
just
patrick
beverly
waited
but
nothing
happened
five
minutes
dragged
by
her
need
to
urinate
was
now
desperate
she
might
be
able
to
hold
out
for
another
two
or
three
minutes
but
no
more
and
it
made
her
uneasy
not
to
know
for
sure
where
patrick
was
she
peeked
through
the
windshield
again
and
saw
him
just
sitting
there
henry
had
forgotten
his
lighter
patrick
had
put
his
schoolbooks
back
into
a
small
canvas
carrier
sack
and
had
slung
it
around
his
neck
like
a
newsboy’s
but
his
pants
and
underpants
were
still
down
around
his
ankles
he
was
playing
with
the
lighter
he
would
spin
the
wheel
produce
a
flame
that
was
almost
invisible
in
the
bright
day
snap
the
lighter
closed
and
then
start
all
over
again
he
seemed
hypnotized
a
line
of
blood
ran
from
the
corner
of
his
mouth
to
his
chin
and
his
lips
were
swelling
up
on
the
right
side
he
seemed
not
to
notice
and
once
again
beverly
felt
a
squirmy
sort
of
revulsion
patrick
was
crazy
all
right
she
had
never
in
her
life
wanted
so
badly
to
get
away
from
someone
moving
very
carefully
she
crawled
backward
over
the
ford
driveshaft
hump
and
squeezed
under
the
steering
wheel
she
put
her
feet
out
on
the
ground
and
crept
to
the
back
of
the
ford
then
she
ran
quickly
back
the
way
she
had
come
when
she
had
entered
the
pines
beyond
the
junked
cars
she
looked
back
over
her
shoulder
no
one
was
there
the
dump
dozed
in
the
sun
she
felt
the
bands
of
tension
around
her
chest
and
stomach
loosen
with
relief
and
all
that
was
left
was
the
need
to
urinate
so
great
that
she
now
felt
sick
with
it
she
hurried
down
the
path
a
short
way
and
then
ducked
off
to
the
nght
she
had
her
shorts
unsnapped
almost
before
the
underbrush
had
closed
behind
her
again
she
took
a
quick
look
around
to
make
sure
there
was
no
poison
ivy
at
hand
then
she
squatted
holding
the
tough
trunk
of
a
bush
for
balance
she
was
pulling
her
shorts
up
again
when
she
heard
approaching
footsteps
from
the
dump
all
she
could
see
through
the
bushes
were
flashes
of
blue
denim
and
the
faded
plaid
of
a
schooł
shirt
it
was
patrick
she
ducked
down
waiting
for
him
to
pass
by
toward
kansas
street
she
was
more
sanguine
about
her
position
here
the
cover
was
good
she
no
longer
had
to
pee
and
patrick
was
off
in
his
own
cuckoo
world
when
he
was
gone
she
would
double
back
and
head
for
the
clubhouse
but
patrick
didn't
pass
by
he
stopped
on
the
path
almost
directly
opposite
her
and
good
looking
at
the
rusting
amana
refrigerator
beverly
could
observe
patrick
along
a
natural
sightline
in
the
bushes
without
too
much
chance
of
being
seen
now
that
she
was
relieved
she
found
she
was
curious
again
and
if
patrick
did
happen
to
see
her
she
felt
certain
she
could
outrun
him
he
wasn't
as
fat
as
ben
but
he
was
podgy
she
pulled
the
bullseye
out
of
her
back
pocket
however
and
put
half
a
dozen
steel
pellets
in
the
breast
pocket
of
her
old
ship
n
shore
crazy
or
not
a
good
one
to
the
knee
might
discourage
the
likes
of
patrick
hockstetter
in
a
hurry
she
remembered
the
refrigerator
well
enough
now
there
were
lots
of
discarded
fridges
at
the
dump
but
it
suddenly
occurred
to
her
that
this
was
the
only
one
she'd
seen
which
mandy
fazio
hadn't
disarmed
by
either
tearing
out
the
latching
mechanism
with
pliers
or
simply
removing
the
door
altogether
patrick
began
to
hum
and
sway
back
and
forth
in
front
of
the
rusty
old
refrigerator
and
beverly
felt
a
fresh
chill
course
through
her
he
was
like
a
guy
in
a
horror
movie
trying
to
summon
a
dead
body
out
of
a
crypt
what
he
up
to
but
if
she
had
known
that
or
what
was
going
to
happen
when
patrick
finished
his
private
ritual
and
opened
the
dead
amana
rusty
door
she
would
have
run
away
as
fast
as
she
could
no
one
not
even
mike
hanlon
had
the
slightest
idea
of
how
crazy
patrick
hockstetter
really
was
he
was
twelve
the
son
of
a
paint
salesman
his
mother
was
a
devout
catholic
who
would
die
of
breast
cancer
in
ur
years
after
patrick
was
consumed
by
the
dark
entity
which
existed
in
and
below
derry
although
his
iq
tested
out
as
low
normal
patrick
had
already
repeated
two
grades
the
first
and
third
he
was
taking
summer
classes
this
year
so
he
would
not
have
to
repeat
the
fifth
as
well
his
teachers
found
him
an
apathetic
student
this
several
of
them
noted
on
the
bare
six
lines
of
the
derry
elementary
school
report
cards
reserved
for
teacher
comments
and
a
rather
disturbing
one
as
well
which
none
noted
their
feelings
were
too
vague
too
diffuse
to
be
expressed
in
sixty
lines
let
alone
six
if
he
had
been
born
ten
years
later
a
guidance
counsellor
might
have
steered
him
toward
a
child
psychologist
who
might
or
might
not
patrick
was
far
more
clever
than
his
lackluster
iq
results
indicated
have
realized
the
frightening
depths
behind
that
slack
and
pallid
moonface
he
was
a
sociopath
and
perhaps
by
that
hot
july
in
he
had
become
a
fullfledged
psychopath
he
could
not
remember
a
time
when
ie
had
believed
that
other
people
any
other
living
creatures
for
that
matter
were
real
he
believed
himself
to
be
an
actual
creature
probably
the
only
one
in
the
universe
but
was
by
no
means
convinced
that
his
actuality
made
him
real
he
had
no
ense
of
hurting
exactly
and
no
real
sense
of
being
hurt
his
indifference
to
being
struck
in
the
mouth
by
henry
in
the
dump
was
a
case
in
point
but
while
he
found
reality
a
totally
meaningless
concept
he
understood
the
concept
of
rules
perfectly
and
while
all
of
his
teachers
had
found
him
odd
both
mrs
douglas
his
fifthgrade
teacher
and
mrs
weems
who
had
had
patrick
in
the
third
grade
knew
about
the
pencilbox
full
of
flies
and
while
neither
of
them
totally
ignored
the
implications
each
had
between
twenty
and
twentyeight
other
students
each
with
problems
of
his
or
her
own
none
of
them
had
serious
disciplinary
problems
with
him
he
might
turn
in
test
papers
that
were
utterly
blank
or
blank
except
for
a
large
decorative
question
mark
and
mrs
douglas
had
discovered
it
was
best
to
keep
him
away
from
the
girls
because
of
his
roman
hands
and
russian
fingers
but
he
was
quiet
so
quiet
that
there
were
times
when
he
might
have
been
taken
for
a
big
lump
of
clay
that
had
been
crudely
fashioned
b
look
like
a
boy
it
was
easy
to
ignore
a
patrick
who
failed
quietly
when
you
had
to
cope
with
boys
like
henry
bowers
and
victor
criss
who
were
actively
disruptive
and
insolent
boys
who
would
steal
milkmoney
or
happily
deface
school
property
if
given
a
chance
and
girls
like
the
unfortunately
named
elizabeth
taylor
who
was
epileptic
and
whose
few
poor
braincells
worked
only
sporadically
and
who
had
to
be
discouraged
from
pulling
her
dresses
up
in
the
playyard
to
show
off
a
new
pan
of
panties
in
other
words
derry
elementary
school
was
the
typical
confused
educational
carnival
a
circus
with
so
many
rings
that
pennywise
himself
might
have
gone
unnoticed
certainly
none
of
patrick
teachers
or
his
parents
for
that
matter
suspected
that
when
he
was
five
patrick
had
murdered
his
baby
brother
avery
patrick
had
not
liked
it
when
his
mother
brought
avery
home
from
the
hospital
he
didn't
care
or
so
he
at
first
told
himself
if
his
parents
had
two
kids
five
kids
or
five
dozen
kids
as
long
as
the
kid
or
kids
didn't
alter
his
own
schedule
but
he
found
that
avery
did
meals
came
late
the
baby
cried
in
the
night
and
woke
him
up
it
seemed
that
his
parents
were
always
hanging
over
its
crib
and
often
when
he
tried
to
get
their
attention
he
found
that
he
could
not
for
one
of
the
few
times
in
his
life
patrick
became
frightened
it
occurred
to
him
that
if
his
parents
had
brought
him
patrick
home
from
the
hospital
and
if
he
was
real
then
avery
might
be
real
too
it
might
even
be
that
when
avery
got
big
enough
to
walk
and
talk
to
bring
in
his
father
copy
of
the
derry
news
from
the
front
step
and
to
hand
his
mother
the
bowls
when
she
baked
bread
they
might
decide
to
get
rid
of
patrick
altogether
it
was
not
that
he
feared
they
loved
avery
more
although
it
was
obvious
to
patrick
that
they
did
love
him
more
and
in
this
case
his
judgment
was
probably
correct
what
he
cared
about
was
the
rules
that
were
being
broken
or
had
changed
since
avery
arrival
avery
possible
reality
and
the
possibility
that
they
might
throw
him
out
in
favor
of
avery
patrick
went
into
avery
room
one
afternoon
around
twothirty
shortly
after
the
school
bus
had
dropped
him
off
from
his
afternoon
kindergarten
session
it
was
january
outside
snow
was
beginning
to
fall
a
powerful
wind
boomed
across
mccarron
park
and
rattled
the
frosty
upstairs
storm
windows
his
mother
was
napping
in
her
bedroom
avery
had
been
fussy
all
the
previous
night
his
father
was
at
work
avery
was
sleeping
on
his
stomach
his
head
turned
to
one
side
patrick
his
moonface
expressionless
turned
avery
head
so
his
face
was
pressed
directly
into
the
pillow
avery
made
a
snuffling
noise
and
turned
his
head
back
to
the
side
patrick
observed
this
and
stood
thinking
about
it
while
the
snow
melted
off
his
yellow
boots
and
puddled
on
the
floor
perhaps
five
minutes
passed
quick
thinking
was
not
patrick
specialty
and
then
he
turned
avery
face
into
the
pillow
again
and
held
it
there
for
a
moment
avery
stirred
under
his
hand
struggling
but
his
struggles
were
weak
patrick
let
go
avery
turned
his
head
to
the
side
again
made
one
snorting
little
cry
and
then
went
on
sleeping
the
wind
gusted
rattling
the
windows
patrick
waited
to
see
if
the
one
little
cry
would
awaken
his
mother
it
didn't
now
he
felt
swept
by
a
great
excitement
the
world
seemed
to
stand
out
in
front
of
him
clearly
for
the
first
time
his
emotional
equipment
was
severely
defective
and
in
those
few
moments
he
felt
as
a
totally
colorblind
person
might
feel
if
given
a
shot
which
enabled
him
to
perceive
colors
for
a
short
time
or
as
a
junkie
who
has
just
fixed
feels
as
the
smack
rockets
his
brain
into
orbit
this
was
a
new
thing
he
had
not
suspected
it
existed
very
gently
he
turned
avery
face
into
the
pillow
again
this
time
when
avery
struggled
patrick
did
not
let
go
he
pressed
the
baby
face
more
firmly
into
the
pillow
the
baby
was
making
steady
muffled
cries
now
and
patrick
knew
it
was
awake
he
had
a
vague
idea
that
it
might
tell
on
him
to
his
mother
if
he
stopped
he
held
it
down
the
baby
struggled
patrick
held
it
down
the
baby
farted
its
struggles
weakened
patrick
still
held
it
down
it
eventually
became
totally
still
patrick
held
it
down
for
another
five
minutes
feeling
that
excitement
crest
and
then
begin
to
ebb
the
shot
wearing
off
turning
the
world
gray
again
the
fix
mellowing
into
an
accustomed
low
doze
patrick
went
downstairs
and
got
himself
a
plate
of
cookies
and
poured
himself
a
glass
of
milk
his
mother
came
down
half
an
hour
later
and
said
she
hadn't
even
heard
him
come
in
she
had
been
that
tired
you
won't
be
anymore
mom
patrick
thought
don't
worry
i
fixed
it
she
sat
down
with
him
ate
one
of
his
cookies
and
asked
him
how
school
had
been
patrick
said
it
was
all
right
and
showed
her
his
drawing
of
a
house
and
a
tree
his
paper
was
covered
with
looping
meaningless
scribbles
made
with
black
and
brown
crayon
his
mother
said
it
was
very
nice
patrick
brought
home
the
same
looping
scrawls
of
back
and
brown
every
day
sometimes
he
said
it
was
a
turkey
sometimes
a
christmas
tree
sometimes
a
boy
his
mother
always
told
him
it
was
very
nice
although
sometimes
in
a
part
of
her
so
deep
she
hardly
knew
it
was
there
she
worried
there
was
something
a
little
disquieting
about
the
dark
sameness
of
those
big
scribbled
loops
of
black
and
brown
she
didn't
discover
avery
death
until
nearly
five
o'clock
until
then
she
had
simply
assumed
he
was
taking
a
very
long
nap
by
then
patrick
was
watching
crusader
rabbit
on
their
seveninch
tv
and
he
went
on
watching
tv
through
all
the
uproar
that
followed
whirlybirds
was
on
when
mrs
henley
arrived
from
next
door
his
screaming
mother
had
been
holding
the
baby
corpse
in
the
open
kitchen
door
believing
in
some
blind
way
that
the
cold
air
might
revive
it
patrick
was
cold
and
got
a
sweater
out
of
the
downstairs
closet
highway
patrol
ben
hanscom
favorite
was
on
when
mr
hockstetter
arrived
home
from
work
by
the
time
the
doctor
arrived
science
hction
theater
with
your
host
truman
bradley
was
just
coming
on
who
knows
what
strange
things
the
universe
may
hold
truman
bradley
speculated
while
patrick
mother
shrieked
and
struggled
in
her
husband
arms
in
the
kitchen
the
doctor
observed
patrick
deep
calm
and
unquestioning
stare
and
assumed
the
boy
was
in
shock
he
wanted
patrick
to
take
a
pill
patrick
didn't
mind
it
was
diagnosed
as
cribdeath
years
later
there
might
have
been
questions
about
such
a
fatality
deviations
from
the
usual
infantdeath
syndrome
observed
but
when
it
happened
the
death
was
simply
noted
and
the
baby
buried
patrick
was
gratified
that
once
things
finally
settled
down
his
meals
began
to
come
on
time
again
in
the
madness
of
that
afternoon
and
evening
people
banging
in
and
out
of
the
house
the
red
lights
of
the
home
hospital
ambulance
pulsing
on
the
walls
mrs
hockstetter
screaming
and
wailing
and
refusing
to
be
comforted
only
patrick
father
came
within
brushing
distance
of
the
truth
he
was
standing
numbly
by
avery
empty
crib
some
twenty
minutes
after
the
body
had
been
removed
simply
standing
there
unable
to
believe
any
of
this
had
happened
he
looked
down
and
saw
a
pair
of
tracks
on
the
hardwood
floor
they
had
been
made
by
the
snow
melting
off
patrick
yellow
rubber
boots
he
looked
at
them
and
a
dreadful
thought
rose
briefly
in
his
mind
like
bad
gas
from
a
deep
mineshaft
his
hand
went
slowly
to
his
mouth
and
his
eyes
widened
a
picture
began
to
form
in
his
mind
before
it
could
come
clear
ie
left
the
room
slamming
the
door
behind
him
so
hard
that
the
top
of
the
frame
splintered
he
never
asked
patrick
any
questions
patrick
had
never
done
anything
like
that
again
although
he
might
have
done
so
if
the
chance
had
presented
itself
he
felt
no
guilt
had
no
bad
dreams
as
time
passed
however
he
became
more
aware
of
what
would
have
happened
to
him
if
he
had
been
caught
there
were
rules
unpleasant
things
happened
to
you
if
you
didn't
follow
them
or
if
you
were
caught
breaking
them
you
could
be
locked
up
or
stuck
in
the
electrocution
chair
but
that
remembered
feeling
of
excitement
that
feeling
of
color
and
sensation
was
simply
too
powerful
and
too
wonderful
to
give
over
entirely
patrick
killed
flies
at
first
he
only
smacked
them
with
his
mother
flyswatter
later
he
discovered
he
could
kill
them
quite
efficiently
with
a
plastic
ruler
he
also
discovered
the
joys
of
flypaper
a
long
sticky
runner
of
it
could
be
purchased
for
two
cents
at
the
costello
avenue
market
and
patrick
sometimes
stood
for
as
long
as
two
hours
in
the
garage
watching
the
flies
land
and
then
struggle
to
get
free
his
mouth
ajar
his
dusty
eyes
alight
with
that
rare
excitement
sweat
running
down
his
round
face
and
his
thick
body
patrick
killed
beetles
but
if
possible
he
captured
them
first
sometimes
he
would
steal
a
long
needle
from
his
mother
pincushion
impale
a
japanese
beetle
on
it
and
sit
crosslegged
in
the
garden
watching
it
die
his
expression
at
these
times
was
the
expression
of
a
boy
who
is
reading
a
very
good
book
once
he
had
discovered
a
run
over
cat
that
was
dying
in
the
gutter
on
lower
main
street
and
sat
watching
it
until
an
old
woman
saw
him
pushing
the
squashed
and
mewing
thing
around
with
his
foot
she
whacked
him
with
the
broom
she
had
been
using
to
sweep
her
walk
go
on
home
she
had
shouted
at
him
what
are
you
crazy
patrick
had
gone
on
home
he
wasn't
mad
at
the
old
woman
he
had
been
caught
breaking
the
rules
that
was
all
then
last
year
it
would
not
have
surprised
mike
hanlon
or
any
of
the
others
at
that
point
to
have
known
that
it
was
in
fact
on
the
same
day
that
george
denbrough
had
been
murdered
patrick
had
discovered
the
rusty
amana
refrigerator
one
of
the
larger
dumpoids
in
the
belt
surrounding
the
dump
itself
like
bev
he
had
heard
the
cautionary
warnings
about
such
abandoned
appliances
about
how
thirtysquirty
million
kids
got
their
stupid
selves
smoked
in
them
each
year
patrick
had
stood
looking
at
the
refrigerator
for
a
long
time
idly
playing
pocketpool
with
himself
that
excitement
was
back
stronger
than
it
had
ever
been
except
for
the
time
he
had
fixed
avery
the
excitement
was
back
because
in
the
chilly
yet
fuming
wastes
that
passed
for
his
mind
patrick
hockstetter
had
had
an
idea
the
luces
who
lived
three
houses
down
from
the
hockstetters
missed
their
cat
bobby
a
week
later
the
luce
kids
who
couldn't
remember
a
time
when
bobby
hadn't
been
there
spent
hours
combing
the
neighborhood
for
him
they
even
pooled
their
money
and
pit
an
ad
in
the
derry
news
lost
and
found
column
nothing
came
of
it
and
if
any
of
them
had
seen
patrick
that
day
bulkier
than
ever
in
his
mothballsmelling
winter
parka
after
the
floodwaters
receded
in
that
fall
of
it
had
come
off
bitterly
cold
almost
at
once
carrying
a
cardboard
carton
they
would
have
thought
nothing
of
it
the
engstroms
a
block
over
and
almost
directly
behind
the
hockstetter
home
lost
their
cocker
pup
about
ten
days
before
thanksgiving
other
families
lost
dogs
and
cats
over
the
next
six
or
eight
months
and
patrick
of
course
had
taken
them
all
not
to
mention
a
dozen
unremarked
strays
from
the
hell
half
acre
area
of
derry
he
put
them
into
the
rusty
amana
near
the
dump
one
by
one
each
time
he
brought
another
animal
down
his
heart
thundering
in
his
chest
his
eyes
hot
and
watery
with
excitement
he
would
expect
to
find
that
mandy
fazio
had
pulled
the
amana
latch
or
popped
the
hinges
with
his
sledgehammer
but
mandy
never
touched
that
particular
refrigerator
perhaps
he
didn't
realize
it
was
there
perhaps
the
force
of
patrick
will
kept
him
away
or
perhaps
some
other
force
did
that
the
engstrom
cocker
lasted
the
longest
in
spite
of
the
singlenumber
cold
it
was
still
alive
when
patrick
came
back
the
third
time
in
as
many
days
although
it
had
lost
all
of
its
original
friskiness
gt
had
been
wagging
its
tail
and
lapping
his
hands
frantically
when
he
originally
hauled
it
out
of
the
box
and
stuffed
it
into
the
refrigerator
when
he
came
back
a
day
after
putting
it
in
the
puppy
had
damn
near
gotten
away
patrick
had
to
chase
it
almost
all
the
way
to
the
dump
before
he
was
able
to
jump
it
and
get
hold
of
one
rear
leg
the
puppy
had
nipped
patrick
with
its
sharp
little
teeth
patrick
didn't
mind
in
spite
of
the
nips
he
had
taken
the
cocker
back
to
the
refrigerator
and
bundled
it
back
in
he
had
a
hardon
when
he
did
it
this
was
not
uncommon
on
the
second
day
the
puppy
had
tried
to
get
out
again
but
it
moved
much
too
slowly
patrick
shoved
it
back
in
slammed
the
amana
rusty
door
and
leaned
against
it
he
could
hear
the
puppy
scratching
against
the
door
he
could
hear
its
muffled
whines
good
do
said
patrick
hockstetter
his
eyes
were
closed
and
he
was
breathing
fast
that
a
good
dog
on
the
third
day
the
puppy
could
only
roll
its
eyes
toward
patrick
face
when
the
door
opened
its
sides
were
heaving
rapidly
and
shallowly
when
patrick
returned
the
next
day
the
cocker
was
dead
with
a
cake
of
foam
frozen
around
its
mouth
and
muzzle
this
made
patrick
think
of
coconut
popsicles
and
he
laughed
quite
hard
as
he
hauled
the
frozen
corpse
from
his
killing
bottle
and
threw
it
in
the
bushes
the
supply
of
victims
which
patrick
thought
of
when
he
thought
of
them
at
all
as
test
animak’
had
been
thin
this
summer
questions
of
reality
aside
his
sense
of
selfpreservation
was
well
developed
his
intuition
exquisite
he
suspected
he
was
suspected
by
whom
he
was
not
sure
mr
engstrom
perhaps
mr
engstrom
had
turned
around
and
given
patrick
a
long
speculative
look
in
the
a&ampp
one
day
this
spring
mr
engstrom
had
been
buying
cigarettes
and
patrick
had
been
sent
for
bread
mrs
josephs
maybe
she
sat
in
her
parlor
window
with
a
telescope
sometimes
and
was
according
to
mrs
hockstetter
a
nosy
parker
mr
jacubois
who
had
an
aspca
sticker
on
the
back
bumper
of
his
car
mr
nell
someone
else
patrick
didn't
know
for
sure
but
his
intuition
told
him
he
was
suspected
and
he
never
argued
with
his
intuition
he
had
taken
a
few
wandering
animals
from
among
the
rotted
tenements
in
the
half
acre
picking
only
those
that
looked
thin
or
diseased
but
that
was
all
he
discovered
however
that
the
refrigerator
near
the
dump
had
gotten
an
oddly
powerful
hold
over
him
he
began
to
draw
pictures
of
in
school
when
he
was
bored
he
sometimes
dreamed
of
it
at
night
and
in
his
dreams
the
amana
was
perhaps
seventy
feet
tall
a
whited
sepulchre
a
ponderous
crypt
iced
in
chilly
moonlight
in
these
dreams
the
giant
door
would
swing
open
and
he
would
see
huge
eyes
staring
out
at
him
he
would
awake
in
a
cold
sweat
but
he
found
he
could
not
give
up
the
joys
of
the
refrigerator
entirely
today
he
had
finally
found
out
who
had
suspected
bowers
knowing
that
henry
bowers
held
the
secret
of
his
killingbottle
in
his
hands
left
patrick
as
close
to
panic
as
he
was
ever
apt
to
get
this
was
not
very
close
at
all
in
truth
but
he
still
found
this
not
fear
exactly
but
mental
unrest
oppressive
and
unpleasant
henry
knew
knew
that
patrick
sometimes
broke
the
rules
his
latest
victim
had
been
a
pigeon
he
discovered
on
jackson
street
two
days
ago
the
pigeon
had
been
struck
by
a
car
and
couldn't
fly
patrick
went
home
got
his
box
out
of
the
garage
and
put
the
pigeon
inside
the
pigeon
pecked
the
back
of
patrick
hand
several
times
leaving
shallow
bloody
digs
patrick
didn't
mind
when
he
checked
the
refrigerator
the
next
day
the
pigeon
had
been
quite
dead
but
patrick
hadn't
removed
the
corpse
then
now
following
henry
threat
to
tell
patrick
decided
he
better
get
rid
of
the
pigeon
body
right
away
perhaps
he
would
even
get
a
bucket
of
water
and
some
rags
and
scrub
out
the
interior
of
the
refrigerator
it
didn't
smell
very
good
if
henry
told
and
mr
nell
came
down
to
check
he
might
be
able
to
tell
that
something
several
somethings
in
fact
had
died
in
there
if
he
tells
patrick
thought
standing
in
the
grove
of
pines
and
looking
at
the
rusty
amana
ti
tell
that
he
broke
eddie
kaspbrak
arm
of
course
they
probably
knew
that
already
but
they
couldn't
prove
anything
because
all
of
them
said
they
had
been
playing
out
at
henry
house
that
day
and
henry
crazy
father
had
backed
them
up
but
if
he
tells
i'll
tell
tit
for
tat
never
mind
that
now
what
he
had
to
do
now
was
get
rid
of
the
bird
he
would
leave
the
refrigerator
door
open
and
then
come
back
with
the
rags
and
the
water
and
clean
it
up
good
patrick
opened
the
refrigerator
door
on
his
own
death
at
first
he
was
simply
puzzled
unable
to
cope
in
any
way
with
what
he
was
seeing
it
meant
nothing
to
him
at
all
it
had
no
context
patrick
merely
stared
his
head
cocked
to
one
side
his
eyes
wide
the
pigeon
was
nothing
but
a
skeleton
surrounded
by
a
ragged
fall
of
feathers
there
was
no
flesh
left
on
its
body
at
all
and
around
it
stuck
on
the
refrigerator
inner
walls
hanging
from
the
underside
of
the
freezer
compartment
dangling
from
the
wire
shelves
were
dozens
of
fleshcolored
objects
that
looked
like
big
macaroni
shells
patrick
saw
that
they
were
moving
sightly
fluttering
as
if
in
a
breeze
except
there
was
no
breeze
he
frowned
suddenly
one
of
the
shelllike
things
unfurled
insectile
wings
before
patrick
could
do
more
than
register
the
fact
it
had
flown
across
the
space
between
the
refrigerator
and
patrick
left
arm
it
struck
with
a
smacking
sound
there
was
an
instant
of
heat
it
faded
and
patrick
arm
felt
just
like
always
again
but
the
shelllike
creature
pale
flesh
turned
first
pink
and
then
with
shocking
suddenness
rosered
although
patrick
was
afraid
of
almost
nothing
in
the
commonly
understood
sense
of
the
word
it
hard
to
be
afraid
of
things
that
aren't
real'
there
was
at
least
one
thing
that
filled
him
with
wretched
loathing
he
had
come
out
of
brewster
lake
one
warm
august
day
when
he
was
seven
to
discover
four
or
five
leeches
clinging
to
his
stomach
and
legs
he
had
screamed
himself
hoarse
until
his
father
had
pulled
them
off
now
in
a
deadly
burst
of
inspiration
he
realized
that
this
was
some
weird
kind
of
fying
leech
they
had
infested
his
refrigerator
patrick
began
to
scream
and
beat
at
the
thing
on
his
arm
it
had
swelled
to
nearly
the
size
of
a
tennis
ball
at
the
third
blow
it
broke
open
with
a
sickening
squtt
sound
blood
his
blood
sprayed
his
arm
from
elbow
to
wrist
but
the
thing
jellylike
eyeless
head
held
on
in
a
way
it
was
like
a
bird
narrow
head
ending
in
a
beaklike
structure
but
this
beak
was
not
flat
or
pointed
it
was
tubular
and
blunt
like
the
proboscis
of
a
mosquito
this
proboscis
was
buried
in
patrick
arm
still
screaming
he
pinched
the
splattered
creature
between
his
fingers
and
pulled
it
off
the
proboscis
came
out
cleanly
followed
by
a
watery
flow
of
blood
mixed
with
some
yellowish
white
liquid
like
pus
it
had
made
a
painless
dimesized
hole
in
his
arm
and
the
creature
although
exploded
was
still
twisting
and
moving
and
seeking
in
his
fingers
patrick
threw
it
away
turned
and
more
of
them
flew
out
of
the
refrigerator
lighting
on
him
even
as
he
groped
for
the
amana
handle
they
landed
on
his
hands
his
arms
his
neck
one
touched
down
on
his
forehead
when
patrick
raised
his
hand
to
pick
it
off
he
saw
four
others
on
his
hand
trembling
minutely
turning
first
pink
and
then
red
there
was
wm
pain
but
there
was
a
hideous
draining
sensation
screaming
whirling
beating
at
his
head
and
neck
with
his
leechencrusted
hands
patrick
hockstetter
mind
yammered
it
isn't
real
it
just
a
bad
dream
don't
worry
it
not
real
nothing
is
real
but
the
blood
pouring
from
the
smashed
leeches
seemed
real
enough
the
sound
of
their
buzzing
wings
seemed
real
enough
and
his
own
terror
seemed
real
enough
one
of
them
fell
down
inside
his
shirt
and
settled
on
his
chest
while
he
was
beating
frantically
at
it
and
watching
the
bloodstain
spread
above
the
place
where
it
had
taken
its
hold
another
settled
on
his
right
eye
patrick
closed
it
but
that
did
no
good
he
felt
a
brief
hot
flare
as
the
thing
sucker
poked
through
his
eyelid
and
began
to
suck
the
fluid
out
of
his
eyeball
patrick
felt
his
eye
collapse
in
its
socket
and
he
screamed
again
a
leech
flew
into
his
mouth
when
he
did
and
roosted
on
his
tongue
it
was
all
almost
painless
patrick
went
staggering
and
flapping
up
he
path
toward
the
junked
cars
parasites
hung
all
over
him
some
of
them
drank
to
capacity
and
then
burst
like
balloons
when
this
happened
to
the
bigger
ones
they
drenched
patrick
with
almost
half
a
pint
of
his
own
hot
blood
he
could
feel
the
leech
inside
his
mouth
swelling
up
and
he
opened
his
jaws
because
the
only
coherent
thought
he
had
left
was
that
it
must
not
burst
in
there
it
must
not
must
not
but
it
did
patrick
ejected
a
huge
spray
of
blood
and
parasiteflesh
like
vomit
he
fell
down
in
the
gravelly
dirt
and
began
to
roll
over
and
over
still
screaming
little
by
little
the
sound
of
his
own
screams
began
to
seem
faint
faraway
just
before
he
passed
out
he
saw
a
figure
step
from
behind
the
last
of
the
junked
cars
at
first
patrick
thought
he
was
a
guy
mandy
fazio
perhaps
and
he
would
be
saved
but
as
the
figure
drew
closer
he
saw
its
face
was
running
like
wax
sometimes
it
began
to
harden
and
look
like
something
or
someone
and
then
it
would
start
to
run
again
as
if
it
couldn't
make
up
its
mind
who
or
what
it
wanted
to
be
hello
and
goodbye
a
bubbling
voice
said
from
inside
the
running
tallow
of
its
features
and
patrick
tried
to
scream
again
he
didn't
want
to
die
as
the
only
real
person
he
wasn't
supposed
to
die
ifhe
did
everyone
else
in
the
world
would
die
with
him
the
manshape
laid
hold
of
his
leechencrusted
arms
and
began
to
drag
him
away
toward
the
barrens
his
bloodstained
bookcarrier
bumped
and
thumped
along
beside
him
its
strap
still
twisted
about
his
neck
patrick
still
trying
to
scream
lost
consciousness
he
awoke
only
once
when
in
some
dark
smelly
drippy
hell
where
no
light
shone
no
light
at
all
it
began
to
feed
at
first
beverly
was
not
entirely
sure
what
she
was
seeing
or
what
was
happening
only
that
patrick
hockstetter
had
begun
to
thrash
and
dance
and
scream
she
got
up
warily
holding
the
slingshot
in
one
hand
and
two
of
the
ballbearings
in
the
other
she
could
hear
patrick
blundering
off
down
the
path
still
yelling
hs
head
off
in
that
moment
beverly
looked
every
inch
the
lovely
woman
she
was
going
to
become
and
if
ben
hanscom
had
been
around
to
see
her
just
then
his
heart
might
not
have
been
able
to
stand
it
she
was
standing
fully
upright
her
head
cocked
to
the
left
her
eyes
wide
her
hair
done
in
braids
that
had
been
tied
off
with
two
small
red
velvet
bows
which
she
had
bought
in
dahlie
for
a
dime
her
posture
was
one
of
total
attention
and
concentration
it
was
feline
lynxlike
she
had
shifted
forward
m
her
left
foot
her
body
halfturned
as
if
to
go
after
patrick
and
the
legs
of
her
faded
shorts
had
pulled
up
enough
to
show
the
edging
on
her
yellow
cotton
panties
below
them
her
legs
were
already
smoothly
muscled
beautiful
in
spite
of
the
scabs
bruises
and
smutches
of
dirt
it
a
trick
he
saw
you
and
he
knows
he
probably
can't
catch
you
in
a
fair
chase
so
he
trying
to
get
you
to
come
out
don't
go
bevvie
but
another
part
of
her
thought
there
was
too
much
pain
and
fear
in
those
screams
she
wished
she
had
seen
whatever
had
happened
to
patrick
if
anything
had
more
clearly
she
wished
more
than
anything
else
that
she
had
come
into
the
barrens
a
different
way
and
missed
the
whole
crazy
shenanigans
patrick
screams
stopped
a
moment
later
beverly
heard
someone
speak
but
she
knew
that
had
to
be
her
imagination
she
heard
her
father
say
hello
and
goodbye
her
father
wasn't
even
in
derry
that
day
he
had
set
off
for
brunswick
at
eight
o'clock
he
and
joe
tammerly
were
going
to
pick
up
a
chevy
truck
in
brunswick
she
shook
her
head
as
if
to
clear
it
the
voice
didn't
speak
again
her
imagination
obviously
she
walked
out
of
the
bushes
to
the
path
ready
to
run
the
instant
she
saw
patrick
charging
at
her
her
reactions
on
triggers
as
delicate
as
a
cat
whiskers
she
looked
down
at
the
path
and
her
eyes
widened
there
was
blood
here
quite
a
lot
of
it
fake
blood
her
mind
insisted
you
can
buy
a
bottle
of
it
at
dahlie
for
fortynine
cents
be
careful
bevvie
she
knelt
and
quickly
touched
the
blood
with
her
fingers
she
looked
at
them
closely
it
wasn't
fake
blood
there
was
a
flash
of
heat
in
her
left
arm
just
below
the
elbow
she
looked
down
and
saw
something
that
she
first
thought
was
some
kind
of
burr
no
not
a
burr
burrs
didn't
twitch
and
flutter
this
thing
was
alive
a
moment
after
that
she
realized
it
was
biting
her
she
struck
it
hard
with
the
back
of
her
right
hand
and
it
spattered
spraying
blood
she
backed
up
a
step
getting
ready
to
scream
now
that
it
was
over
and
then
she
saw
that
it
wasn't
over
at
all
the
thing
featureless
head
was
still
on
her
arm
its
snout
buried
in
her
flesh
with
a
shrill
cry
of
disgust
and
fear
she
picked
it
off
and
saw
its
proboscis
come
out
of
her
arm
like
a
small
dagger
dripping
with
blood
she
understood
the
blood
on
the
path
now
oh
yes
and
her
eyes
went
to
the
refrigerator
the
door
had
swung
closed
and
latched
again
but
a
number
of
the
parasites
had
been
left
outside
and
were
crawling
sluggishly
over
the
rustywhite
porcelain
as
beverly
looked
one
of
them
unfurled
its
membranous
flylike
wings
and
buzzed
toward
her
she
acted
without
thinking
loading
one
of
the
steel
ballbearings
into
the
cup
of
the
bullseye
and
pulling
the
sling
back
as
the
muscles
of
her
left
arm
flexed
smoothly
she
saw
loose
blood
squirt
from
the
hole
the
thing
had
made
in
her
arm
she
let
fly
anyway
unconsciously
leading
the
flying
thing
shit
missed
she
thought
as
the
bullseye
snapped
and
the
ballbearing
flew
a
glittering
chunk
of
light
in
the
hazy
sun
and
she
would
later
tell
the
other
losers
that
she
knew
she
had
missed
it
the
same
way
a
bowler
knows
he
has
missed
the
strike
as
soon
as
a
bad
ball
leaves
his
hand
but
then
she
saw
the
ballbearing
curve
it
happened
in
a
splitsecond
but
the
impression
was
very
clear
it
had
curved
it
struck
the
flying
thing
and
splattered
it
to
mush
there
was
a
shower
of
yellowish
droplets
which
pattered
on
the
path
beverly
backed
up
slowly
at
first
her
eyes
huge
her
lips
trembling
her
face
a
shocked
grayish
white
her
gaze
was
pinned
to
the
front
of
the
discarded
refrigerator
waiting
to
see
if
any
of
the
other
things
would
smell
or
sense
her
but
the
parasites
only
crawled
slowly
back
and
forth
like
autumn
flies
drugged
with
the
cold
at
last
she
turned
and
ran
panic
beat
darkly
against
her
thoughts
but
she
would
not
give
in
to
it
entirely
she
held
the
bullseye
in
her
left
hand
and
looked
back
over
her
shoulder
from
time
to
time
there
was
still
blood
dappled
brightly
on
the
path
and
on
the
leaves
of
some
of
the
bushes
bordering
it
as
if
patrick
had
woven
from
side
to
side
as
he
ran
beverly
burst
out
into
the
area
of
the
junked
cars
again
ahead
of
her
there
was
a
bigger
splash
of
blood
just
teginning
to
soak
into
the
gravelly
earth
the
ground
looked
disturbed
darker
streaks
of
earth
lined
into
the
powderywhite
surface
as
if
there
had
been
a
struggle
there
two
grooves
about
two
and
a
half
feet
apart
led
away
from
this
spot
beverly
halted
panting
she
looked
at
her
arm
and
was
relieved
to
see
that
the
flow
of
blood
was
finally
slowing
although
her
lower
forearm
and
the
palm
of
her
hand
were
streaked
and
tacky
with
it
the
pain
had
begun
now
a
low
steady
throb
it
felt
the
way
her
mouth
felt
about
an
hour
after
the
dentist
when
the
novocaine
began
to
wear
off
she
looked
behind
again
saw
nothing
then
looked
back
at
those
grooves
leading
away
from
the
junked
cars
away
from
the
dump
and
into
the
barrens
those
things
were
in
the
refrigerator
they
got
all
over
him
sure
they
did
look
at
all
the
blood
he
got
this
far
and
then
hello
and
goodbye
something
else
happened
what
she
was
terribly
afraid
she
knew
the
leeches
were
a
part
of
it
and
they
had
driven
patrick
into
another
part
of
it
much
as
a
panicmaddened
steer
is
driven
down
the
chute
and
into
the
slaughtering
pen
get
out
of
here
get
out
bevvie
instead
she
followed
the
grooves
in
the
earth
holding
the
bullseye
tightly
in
her
sweating
hand
at
least
get
the
others
twill
ina
little
while
she
walked
on
following
the
grooves
as
the
ground
sloped
down
and
became
softer
she
followed
them
into
heavy
foliage
again
somewhere
a
cicada
burred
loudly
and
then
unwound
into
silence
mosquitoes
lighted
on
her
bloodstreaked
arm
she
waved
them
away
her
teeth
were
clenched
on
her
lower
lip
there
was
something
lying
on
the
ground
ahead
she
picked
it
up
and
looked
at
it
it
was
a
handmade
wallet
the
sort
of
thing
a
kid
might
make
as
a
crafts
project
at
community
house
except
it
was
obvious
to
bev
that
the
kid
who
made
this
hadn't
been
much
of
a
craftsman
the
wide
plastic
stitching
was
already
coming
unravelled
and
the
bill
compartment
flapped
like
a
loose
mouth
she
found
a
quarter
in
the
change
compartment
the
only
other
thing
in
the
wallet
was
a
library
card
made
out
in
the
name
of
patrick
hockstetter
she
tossed
the
wallet
aside
library
card
and
all
she
wiped
her
fingers
on
her
shorts
fifty
feet
farther
on
she
found
a
sneaker
the
underbrush
was
now
too
dense
for
her
to
be
able
to
follow
the
grooves
in
the
earth
but
you
didn't
have
to
be
the
pathfinder
to
follow
the
splashes
and
drips
of
blood
on
the
bushes
the
trail
wound
down
through
a
steep
brake
bev
lost
her
footing
once
slid
and
was
raked
by
thors
fresh
lines
of
blood
appeared
on
her
upper
thigh
she
was
breathing
fast
now
her
hair
sweaty
and
matted
to
her
skull
the
spots
of
blood
led
out
onto
one
of
the
faint
paths
through
the
barrens
the
kenduskeag
was
nearby
patrick
other
sneaker
its
laces
bloody
lay
marooned
on
the
path
she
approached
the
river
with
the
bullseye
sling
halfdrawn
the
grooves
in
the
earth
had
reappeared
they
were
shallower
now
that
because
he
lost
his
sneakers
she
thought
she
came
around
a
final
bend
and
faced
the
river
the
grooves
went
down
the
bank
and
led
ultimately
to
one
of
those
concrete
cylinders
one
of
the
pumpingstations
there
they
stopped
the
iron
cover
capping
the
top
of
this
cylinder
was
a
little
ajar
as
she
stood
above
it
looking
down
a
thick
and
monstrous
chuckle
suddenly
issued
from
beneath
it
was
too
much
the
panic
which
had
threatened
now
descended
beverly
turned
and
fled
toward
the
clearing
and
clubhouse
her
bloody
left
arm
up
to
shield
her
face
from
the
branches
which
whipped
and
slapped
her
sometimes
i
worry
too
daddy
she
thought
wildly
sometimes
i
worry
a
lot
four
hours
later
all
of
the
losers
except
eddie
crouched
in
the
bushes
near
the
spot
where
beverly
had
hidden
and
watched
patrick
hockstetter
go
to
the
refrigerator
and
open
it
the
sky
overhead
had
darkened
with
thunderheads
and
the
smell
of
rain
was
in
the
air
again
bill
was
holding
the
end
of
a
long
length
of
clothesline
in
his
hands
tħe
six
of
them
had
pooled
their
available
cash
and
bought
the
line
and
a
johnson
firstaid
kit
for
beverly

had
carefully
affixed
a
gauze
pad
over
the
bloody
hole
in
her
arm

bill
said
my

beverly
cried
dismayed
she
had
forgotten
all
about
them
there
ben
said
and
pointed
they
were
lying
in
a
heap
not
far
away
and
she
went
to
retrieve
them
before
ben
or
bill
or
any
of
the
others
could
dfer
she
remembered
now
that
she
had
put
them
aside
before
urinating
she
didn't
want
any
of
the
others
over
there
bill
himself
had
tied
one
end
of
the
clothesline
to
the
handle
of
the
amana
refrigerator
although
they
had
all
cautiously
approached
it
together
ready
to
bolt
at
the
first
sign
of
movement
bev
had
offered
to
give
the
bullseye
back
to
bill
he
had
insisted
she
keep
it
as
it
turned
out
nothing
had
moved
although
the
area
on
the
path
in
front
of
the
refrigerator
was
splattered
with
blood
the
parasites
were
gone
perhaps
they
had
flown
away
you
could
bring
chief
borton
and
mr
nell
and
a
hundred
other
cops
down
here
and
it
still
wouldn't
matter
stan

said
bitterly
nope

frockin
thin

how
your
arm

she
paused
looking
from
bill
to
richie
and
back
to
bill
again

he
looped
the
cod
of
the
clothesline
around
the
refrigerator
rustflecked
chrome
handle
working
with
the
care
of
a
man
defusing
a
live
bomb
he
tied
a
grannyknot
and
then
stepped
back
paying
out
the
clothesline
he
grinned
a
small
shaky
grin
at
the
others
when
they
had
made
some
distance
whoo
he
said
gglad
that
ohover
now
a
safe
they
hoped
distance
from
the
refrigerator
bill
told
them
again
to
get
ready
to

thunder
boomed
directly
overhead
and
they
all

his

popped
off

but
not
before
it
had
pulled
the

door
open
again
an
avalanche
of
orange
pompoms
fell
out
and
stan
uris
uttered
a
painful
groan
the
others
only
stared
openmouthed
the
rain
began
to
come
harder
thunder
whipcracked
above
them
making
them
cringe
and
purplishblue
lightning
flared
as
the
refrigerator
door
swung
all
the
way
open
richie
saw
it
first
and
screamed
a
high
hurt
sound
bill
uttered
some
sort
of
angry
frightened
cry
the
others
were
silent
written
on
the
inside
of

written
in
drying
blood
were

in

the

beginning

taking
on
the

ominous
look
of
a

bev
was
not
aware
that
bill
had
gotten
up
until
she
saw
him
advancing
across
the
path
toward
the
refrigerator
he
was
shaking
both
fists
water
streamed
down
his
face
and
plastered
his
shirt
to
his
back

screamed
thunder
whacked
and
cracked
lightning
flashed
so
brightly
that
she
could

and
not

there
was
a
splintering
rending
sound
as
a
tree
fell
bill
come
back
richie
was
yelling
come
back
ma
he
started
to
get
up
and
ben
hauled
him

in
a
spate
stinging
them
even
through
the
screening
bushes
beverly
held
her
arm
up
to
protect
her
face
she
could
see
red
welts
on
ben
streaming
cheeks
bill
come
bac
she
screamed
despairingly
and
another
thundercrack
drowned
her
out
it
rolled
across
the
barrens
below
the
low
black
clouds
let

you
come
out
now
you
fucker
bill
kicked
wildly
at
the
heap
of
pompoms
that
had
spilled
out
of
the
refrigerator
he
turned
away
and
began
to
walk
back
toward
them
his
head
down
he
seemed
not
to
feel
the
hail
although
it
now
covered
the
ground
like
snow
he
blundered
into
the
bushes
and
stan
had
to
grab
bis
arm
to
keep
him
from
going
into
the
prickerbushes
he
was
crying
that
okay
bill
ben
said
putting
a
clumsy
arm
around
him
yeah
richie
said
don't

he
stared
around
at
them
his
eyes
looking
wildly
out
of
his
wet
face
is
there
anyone
here
who
gonna
chicken
out
they
shook
their
heads
bill
looked
up
wiping
his
eyes
they
were
all
soaked
to
the
skin
and
looked
like
a
litter
of
pups
that
had
just
forded
a
river

beverly
said
she
took
bill
in
her
arms
she
had
not
realized
how
easily
her
arms
would
go
around
him
how
thin
he
was
she
could
feel
his
heart
racing
under
his
shut
she
could
feel
it
next
to
hers
she
thought
that
no
touch
had
ever
seemed
so
sweet
and
strong
richie
put
his
arms
around
both
of
them
and
laid
his
head
on
beverly
shoulder
bin
did
the
same
from
the
other
side
stan
uris
put
his
arms
around
richie
and
ben
mike
hesitated
and
then
slipped
one
arm
around
beverly
waist
and
the
other
over
bill
shivering
shoulders
they
stood
that
way
hugging
and
the
sleet
turned
back
to
driving
pouring
rain
rain
so
heavy
it
seemed
almost
like
a
new
atmosphere
the
lightning
walked
and
the
thunder
talked
no
one
spoke
beverly
eyes
were
tightly
shut
they
stood
in
the
rain
in
a
huddled
group
hugging
each
other
listening
to
it
hiss
down
m
the
bushes
that
was
what
she
remembered
best
the
sound
of
the
rain
and
their
own
shared
silence
and
a
vague
sorrow
that
eddie
was
not
there
with
them
she
remembered
those
things
she
remembered
feeling
very
young
and
very
strong
chapter
the
bullseye
okay
haystack
richie
says
your
turn
the
redhead
smoked
all
of
her
cigarettes
and
most
of
mine
the
hour
groweth
late
ben
glances
up
at
the
clock
yes
it
late
nearly
midnight
just
time
for
one
more
story
he
thinks
one
more
story
before
twelve
just
to
keep
us
warm
what
should
it
be
but
that
of
course
is
only
a
joke
and
not
a
very
good
one
there
is
only
one
story
left
at
least
only
one
he
remembers
and
that
is
the
story
of
the
silver
slugs
how
they
were
made
in
zack
denbrough
workshop
on
the
night
of
july
rd
and
how
they
were
used
on
the
th
tve
got
my
own
scar
he
says
do
you
remembe
beverly
and
eddie
shake
their
heads
bill
and
richie
nod
mike
sits
silent
his
eyes
watchful
in
his
tired
face
ben
stands
up
and
unbuttons
the
workshirt
he
is
wearing
spreading
it
open
an
old
scar
in
the
shape
of
the
letter
shows
there
its
lines
are
broken
the
belly
was
much
bigger
when
that
scar
was
put
there
but
its
shape
still
identifiable
the
heavy
scar
depending
downward
from
the
crossbar
of
the
is
much
clearer
it
looks
like
a
twisted
white
hangrope
from
which
the
noose
has
been
cut
beverly
hand
goes
to
her
mouth
the
werewolf
in
that
house
oh
jesus
christ
and
she
turns
to
the
windows
as
if
to
see
it
lurking
outside
in
the
darkness
that
right
ben
said
and
you
want
to
know
something
funny
that
scar
wasn't
there
two
days
ago
henry
old
callingcard
was
i
know
because
i
showed
it
to
a
friend
of
mine
a
bartender
named
ricky
lee
back
in
hemingford
home
but
this
one
he
laughs
without
much
humor
and
begins
buttoning
his
shirt
again
this
one
just
came
back
like
the
ones
on
our
hands
yea
mike
says
as
ben
buttons
his
skin
up
again
the
werewolf
we
all
saw
it
as
the
werewolf
that
time
because
that
how
rrrichie
saw
lhit
befor
bill
murmurs
that
it
isn't
i
ye
mike
says
we
were
close
weren't
w
beverly
says
her
voice
is
softly
marvelling
close
enough
to
read
each
other
minds
ole
big
hairy
damn
near
had
your
guts
for
garters
be
richie
says
and
he
is
not
smiling
as
he
says
it
he
pushes
his
mended
glasses
up
on
his
nose
and
behind
them
his
face
looks
white
and
haggard
and
ghostly
bill
saved
your
baco
eddie
says
abruptly
i
mean
bev
saved
us
all
but
if
it
hadn't
been
for
you
bill
ye
ben
agrees
you
did
big
bill
i
was
like
lost
in
the
funhouse
bill
points
briefly
at
the
empty
chair
i
had
some
help
from
stan
uris
and
he
paid
for
it
maybe
died
for
it
ben
hansom
is
shaking
his
head
don't
say
that
bill
but
it
ttrue
and
if
it
yuhyour
ffault
it
my
fault
too
and
eeeveryone
else
here
because
we
went
on
even
after
patrick
ad
what
was
written
on
that
rrefrigerator
we
went
on
it
would
be
my
fault
mmost
of
all
i
guess
because
i
wub
wub
wanted
us
to
go
on
because
of
juhgeorge
maybe
even
because
i
thought
that
if
i
killed
whatever
kkilled
george
my
puhharents
would
have
to
luhluhluh
love
you
agai
beverly
asks
gently
yes
of
course
but
i
dddon't
think
it
was
aaanyone
fuhhault
ben
it
was
just
the
w
wway
stan
was
built
he
couldn't
face
i
eddie
says
he
is
thinking
of
mr
keene
revelation
about
his
asthma
medicine
and
how
he
could
still
not
give
it
up
he
is
thinking
that
he
might
have
been
able
to
give
up
the
habit
of
being
sick
it
was
the
habit
of
believing
he
had
been
unable
to
kick
as
things
had
turned
out
maybe
that
habit
had
saved
his
life
he
was
great
that
da
ben
says
stan
and
his
birds
a
chuckle
stirs
through
them
and
they
look
at
the
chair
where
stan
would
have
been
in
a
rightful
sane
world
where
all
the
good
guys
won
all
of
the
time
i
miss
him
ben
thinks
god
how
i
miss
him
he
says
you
remember
that
day
richie
when
you
told
him
you
heard
somewhere
he
killed
christ
and
stan
says
totally
deadpan
i
think
that
was
my
father
'
remember
richie
says
in
a
voice
almost
too
low
to
hear
he
takes
his
handkerchief
out
of
his
back
pocket
removes
his
glasses
wipes
his
eyes
then
puts
his
glasses
back
on
he
puts
away
the
handkerchief
and
without
looking
up
from
his
hands
he
says
why
don't
you
just
tell
it
be
tt
hurts
doesn't
i
yea
richie
says
his
voice
so
thick
it
is
hard
to
understand
him
why
sure
it
hurts
ben
looks
around
at
them
then
nods
all
right
then
one
more
story
before
twelve
just
to
keep
us
warm
bill
and
richie
had
the
idea
of
the
bullets
n
richie
demurs
bill
thought
of
it
first
and
he
got
nervous
first
i
just
started
to
wuhwuhworry
doesn't
really
matter
i
guess
ben
says
the
three
of
us
spent
some
heavy
library
time
that
july
we
were
trying
to
find
out
how
to
make
silver
bullets
i
had
the
silver
four
silver
dollars
that
were
my
father
then
bill
got
nervous
thinking
about
what
kind
of
shape
we'd
be
in
if
we
had
a
misfire
with
some
kind
of
monster
coming
down
our
throats
and
when
we
saw
how
good
beverly
was
with
that
slingshot
of
his
we
ended
up
using
one
of
my
silver
dollars
to
make
slugs
instead
we
got
the
stuff
together
and
all
of
us
we
went
down
to
bill
place
eddie
you
were
there
told
my
mother
we
were
going
to
play
monopol
eddie
says
my
arm
was
really
hurting
but
i
had
to
walk
that
how
pissed
she
was
at
me
and
every
time
i
heard
someone
behind
me
on
the
sidewalk
i'd
whip
around
thinking
it
was
bowers
it
didn't
help
the
pain
bill
grins
and
what
we
did
was
stand
around
and
watch
ben
make
the
ammo
i
think
ben
rreally
could
have
made
silsilver
bullets
oh
i'm
not
so
sure
of
that
ben
says
although
he
still
is
he
remembers
how
the
dusk
was
drawing
down
outside
mr
denbrough
had
promised
them
all
rides
home
the
sound
of
the
crickets
in
the
grass
the
first
lightningbugs
blinking
outside
the
windows
bill
had
carefully
set
up
the
monopoly
board
in
the
dining
room
making
it
look
as
if
the
game
had
been
going
on
for
an
hour
or
more
he
remembers
that
amd
the
clean
pool
of
yellow
light
falling
on
zack
worktable
he
remembers
bill
saying
we
gotta
be
cc
careful
i
don't
want
to
leave
a
muh
muhmess
my
dad'll
be
he
spat
out
a
number
of
p
and
finally
managed
to
say
pissed
off
richie
made
a
burlesque
of
wiping
his
cheek
do
you
serve
towels
with
your
showers
stuttering
bill
bill
made
as
if
to
hit
him
richie
cowered
shrieking
in
his
pickaninny
voice
ben
took
very
little
notice
of
them
he
watched
bill
lay
out
the
implements
and
tools
one
by
one
in
the
light
part
of
his
mind
was
wishing
that
someday
he
might
have
such
a
nice
worktable
as
this
himself
most
of
it
was
centered
directly
on
the
job
ahead
hot
as
difficult
as
making
silver
bullets
would
have
been
but
he
would
still
be
careful
there
was
no
excuse
for
sloppy
workmanship
this
was
not
something
he
had
been
taught
or
told
just
something
he
knew
bill
had
insisted
that
ben
make
the
slugs
just
as
he
continued
to
insist
that
beverly
would
be
the
one
carrying
the
bullseye
these
things
could
have
and
had
been
discussed
but
it
was
only
twentyseven
years
later
telling
the
story
that
ben
realized
no
one
had
even
suggested
that
a
silver
bullet
or
slug
might
not
stop
a
monster
they
had
the
weight
of
what
seemed
like
a
thousand
horror
movies
on
their
side
okay
ben
said
he
cracked
his
knuckles
and
then
looked
at
bill
you
got
the
molds
oh
bill
jumped
a
little
hhhere
he
reached
into
his
pants
pocket
and
brought
out
his
handkerchief
he
put
it
on
the
workbench
and
unfolded
it
there
were
two
dull
steel
balls
inside
each
with
a
small
hole
in
it
they
were
bearing
molds
after
deciding
on
slugs
instead
of
bullets
bill
and
richie
had
gone
back
to
the
library
and
had
researched
how
bearings
were
made
you
boys
are
so
busy
mrs
starrett
had
said
bullets
one
week
and
bearings
the
next
and
it
summer
vacation
too
we
like
to
stay
sharp
richie
said
right
bill
ruhruh
right
it
turned
out
that
making
bearings
was
a
cinch
once
you
had
the
molds
the
only
real
question
was
where
to
get
them
a
couple
of
discreet
questions
to
zack
denbrough
had
taken
care
of
that
and
none
of
the
losers
were
too
surprised
to
find
that
the
only
machineshop
in
derry
where
such
molds
might
be
obtained
was
kitchener
precision
tool
die
the
kitchener
who
owned
and
ran
it
was
a
greatgreatgrandnephew
of
the
brothers
who
had
owned
the
kitchener
ironworks
bill
and
richie
had
gone
over
together
with
all
the
cash
the
losers
had
been
able
to
raise
on
short
notice
ten
dollars
and
fiftynine
cents
in
bill
pocket
when
bill
asked
how
much
a
couple
of
twoinch
bearing
molds
might
cost
carl
kitchener
who
looked
like
a
veteran
boozehound
and
smelled
like
an
old
horseblanket
asked
what
a
couple
of
kids
wanted
with
bearing
molds
richie
let
bill
speak
knowing
things
would
probably
go
easier
that
way
children
made
fun
of
bill
stutter
adults
were
embarrassed
by
it
sometimes
this
was
surprisingly
helpful
bill
got
halfway
through
the
explanation
he
and
richie
had
worked
out
on
the
way
over
something
about
a
model
windmill
for
next
year
science
project
when
kitchener
waved
for
him
to
shut
up
and
quoted
them
the
unbelievable
price
of
fifty
cents
per
mold
hardly
able
to
believe
their
good
fortune
bill
forked
over
a
single
dollar
bill
don't
expect
me
to
give
you
a
bag
carl
kitchener
said
eying
them
with
the
bloodshot
contempt
of
a
man
who
believes
he
has
seen
everything
the
world
holds
most
of
it
twice
you
don't
get
no
bag
unless
you
spend
at
least
five
bucks
that
oookay
suhsi
bill
said
and
don't
hang
around
out
front
kitchener
said
you
both
need
haircuts
outside
bill
said
yyyou
ever
nuhhotice

how
gub
guhgrownups
ww
won't
sell

richie

that
because

richie
said
and
then
giggled

we'll
put
up
our
collars
and
sneer
at
people
and
let
our
hair
grow
fuck
yyou
bill
said
oka
ben
said
looking
at
the
molds
carefully
and
then
putting
them
down
good
now
they
gave
him
a
little
more
room
looking
at
him
hopefully
the
way
a
man
with
engine
trouble
who
knows
nothing
about
cars
will
look
at
a
mechanic
ben
didn't
notice
their
expressions
he
was
concentrating
on
the
job
gimme
that
shell
he
said
and
the
blowtorch
bill
handed
a
cutdown
mortar
shell
to
him
it
was
a
war
souvenir
zack
had
picked
it
up
five
days
after
he
and
the
rest
of
general
patton
army
had
crossed
he
river
into
germany
there
had
been
a
time
when
bill
was
very
young
and
george
was
still
in
diapers
that
his
father
had
used
it
as
an
ashtray
later
he
had
quit
smoking
and
the
mortar
shell
had
disappeared
bill
had
found
it
in
the
back
of
the
garage
just
a
week
ago
ben
put
the
mortar
shell
into
zack
vise
tightened
it
and
then
took
the
blowtorch
from
beverly
he
reached
into
his
pocket
brought
out
a
silver
dollar
and
dropped
it
into
the
makeshift
crucible
it
made
a
hollow
sound
your
father
gave
you
that
didn't
beverly
asked
yes
ben
said
but
i
don't
remember
him
very
well
are
you
sure
you
want
to
do
this
he
looked
at
her
and
smiled
ye
he
said
she
smiled
back
it
was
enough
for
ben
if
she
had
smiled
at
him
twice
he
would
gladly
have
made
enough
silver
bearings
to
shoot
a
platoon
of
werewolves
he
looked
hastily
away
okay
here
we
go
no
problem
easy
as
pie
right
they
nodded
hesitantly
years
later
recounting
all
of
this
ben
would
think
these
days
a
kid
could
just
run
out
and
buy
a
propane
torch
or
his
dad
would
have
one
in
the
workshop
there
had
been
no
such
things
in
however
zack
denbrough
had
a
tankjob
and
it
made
beverly
nervous
ben
could
tell
she
was
nervous
wanted
to
tell
her
not
to
worry
but
was
afraid
his
voice
would
tremble
don't
worr
he
said
to
stan
who
was
standing
next
to
her
huh
stan
said
looking
at
him
and
bunking
don't
worry
t'm
not
oh
i
thought
you
were
and
i
just
wanted
you
to
know
this
is
perfectly
safe
jf
you
were
worrying
i
mean
are
you
okay
ben
fine
ben
muttered
gimme
the
matches
richie
richie
gave
him
a
book
of
matches
ben
twisted
the
valve
on
the
tank
and
lit
a
match
under
the
nozzle
of
the
torch
there
was
a
flump
and
a
bright
blueorange
glare
ben
tuned
the
flame
to
a
blue
edge
and
began
to
heat
the
base
of
the
mortar
shell
you
got
the
funnel
he
asked
bill
rrright
here
bill
handed
over
a
homemade
funnel
that
ben
had
made
earlier
the
tiny
hole
at
its
base
fit
the
hole
in
the
bearing
molds
almost
exactly
ben
had
done
this
without
taking
a
single
measurement
bill
had
been
amazed
almost
flabbergasted
but
did
not
know
how
to
say
so
without
embarrassing
ben
absorbed
in
what
he
was
doing
ben
could
talk
to
beverly
he
spoke
with
the
dry
precision
of
a
surgeon
addressing
a
nurse
bev
you
got
the
steadiest
hands
suck
the
funnel
in
the
hole
use
one
of
those
gloves
so
you
don't
get
burned
bill
handed
her
one
of
his
father
work
gloves
beverly
put
the
tin
funnel
in
the
mold
no
one
spoke
the
hissing
of
the
blowtorch
flame
seemed
very
loud
they
watched
it
eyes
squinted
almost
shut
wuhwuhwait
bill
said
suddenly
and
dashed
into
the
house
he
came
back
a
minute
later
with
a
pair
of
cheap
turtle
wraparound
sunglasses
that
had
been
languishing
in
a
kitchen
drawer
for
a
year
or
more
better
pput
these
uhon
hhhaystack
ben
took
them
grinned
and
slipped
them
on
shit
it
fabian
richie
said
or
frankie
avalon
or
one
of
those
bandstand
wops
fuck
you
trashmout
ben
said
but
he
started
giggling
in
spite
of
himself
the
idea
of
him
being
fabian
or
someone
like
that
was
just
too
weird
the
flame
wavered
and
he
stopped
laughing
his
concentration
narrowed
to
a
point
again
two
minutes
later
he
handed
the
torch
to
eddie
who
held
it
gingerly
in
his
good
hand
it
ready
he
said
to
bill
gimme
that
other
glove
fast
fas
bill
gave
it
to
him
ben
put
it
on
and
held
the
mortar
shell
with
the
gloved
hand
while
he
turned
the
vise
lever
with
the
other
hold
it
steady
bev
tm
ready
don't
wait
for
me
she
rapped
back
at
him
ben
tilted
the
shell
over
the
funnel
the
others
watched
as
a
rivulet
of
molten
silver
flowed
between
the
two
receptacles
ben
poured
precisely
not
a
drop
was
spilled
and
for
a
moment
he
felt
galvanized
he
seemed
to
see
everything
magnified
through
a
strong
white
glow
for
that
one
moment
he
did
not
feel
like
plain
fat
old
ben
hanscom
who
wore
sweatshirts
to
disguise
his
gut
and
his
tits
he
felt
like
thor
working
thunder
and
lightning
at
the
smithy
of
the
gods
then
the
feeling
was
gone
okay
he
said
tm
gonna
have
to
reheat
the
silver
someone
shove
a
nail
or
something
up
the
spout
of
the
funnel
before
the
goop
hardens
in
there
stan
did
it
ben
clamped
the
mortar
shell
in
the
vise
again
and
took
the
torch
from
eddie
okay
he
said
number
two
and
went
back
to
work
ten
minutes
later
it
was
done
now
what
mike
asked
now
we
play
monopoly
for
an
hour
ben
said
while
they
harden
in
the
molds
then
i
clip
em
open
with
a
chisel
along
the
cutlines
and
we're
done
richie
looked
uneasily
at
the
cracked
face
of
his
timex
which
had
taken
a
great
many
lickings
and
kept
on
ticking
when
will
your
folks
be
back
bill
nnnot
until
tuhten
or
tenthuh
thubhirty
bill
said
tts

double
ffffeature

bill
nodded
then
let
go
in
bev
said
i
want
to
call
home
i
promised
i
would
and
don't
any
of
you
talk
he
thinks
i'm
at
community
house
and
that
i'm
getting
a
ride
home
from
there
what
if
he
wants
to
come
down
and
pick
you
up
early
mike
asked
then
beverly
said
i'm
going
to
be
in
a
lot
of
trouble
ben
thought
i'd
protect
you
beverly
in
his
mind
eye
an
instant
daydream
unfolded
one
with
an
ending
so
sweet
he
shivered
bev
father
started
to
give
her
a
hard
time
to
bawl
her
out
and
all
that
even
in
his
daydream
he
did
not
imagine
how
bad
all
that
could
get
with
al
marsh
ben
threw
himself
in
front
of
her
and
told
marsh
to
lay
off
if
you
want
trouble
fatboy
you
just
keep
protecting
my
daughter
hanscom
usually
a
quiet
bookish
type
can
be
a
ravening
tiger
when
you
get
him
mad
he
speaks
to
al
marsh
with
great
sincerity
[f
you
want
to
get
to
her
you'll
have
to
come
through
me
first
marsh
starts
forward
and
then
the
steely
glint
in
hanscom
eyes
stops
him
you'll
be
sorry
be
mumbles
but
it
clear
all
the
fight
has
gone
out
of
him
he
just
a
paper
tiger
after
all
somehow
i
doubt
that
hanscom
says
with
a
tight
gary
cooper
smile
and
beverly
father
slinks
away
what
happened
to
you
ben
bev
cries
but
her
eyes
are
shining
and
full
of
stars
you
looked
ready
to
kill
him
kill
him
hanscom
says
the
gary
cooper
smile
still
lingering
on
his
lips
no
way
baby
he
may
be
a
creep
but
he
still
your
father
i
might
have
roughed
him
up
a
little
but
that
only
because
when
someone
talks
wrong
to
you
i
get
a
little
hot
under
the
collar
you
know
she
throws
her
arms
around
him
and
kisses
him
on
the
lips
on
the
lips
i
love
you
ben
she
sobs
he
can
feel
her
small
breasts
pressing
firmly
against
his
chest
and
he
shivered
a
little
throwing
this
bright
terribly
clear
picture
off
with
an
effort
richie
stood
in
the
doorway
asking
him
if
he
was
coming
and
ben
realized
he
was
all
alone
in
the
workroom
yea
he
said
starting
a
little
sure
i
am
you're
goin
senile
haystack
richie
said
as
ben
went
though
the
door
but
he
clapped
ben
on
the
shoulder
ben
grinned
and
hooked
an
elbow
briefly
around
richie
neck
there
was
no
problem
with
beverly
dad
he
had
come
home
late
from
work
bev
mother
told
her
over
the
phone
fallen
asleep
in
front
of
the
tv
and
waked
up
just
long
enough
to
get
himself
into
bed
you
got
a
ride
home
bevvi
yes
bill
denbrough
dad
is
going
to
take
a
whole
bunch
of
us
home
mrs
marsh
sounded
suddenly
alarmed
you're
not
on
a
date
are
you
bevvie
no
of
course
not
bev
said
looking
through
the
arched
doorway
between
the
darkened
hall
where
she
was
and
the
dining
room
where
the
others
were
sitting
down
around
the
monopoly
board
but
i
sure
wish
i
was
boys
uck
but
they
have
a
signup
sheet
down
here
and
every
night
a
different
dad
or
mom
takes
kids
home
that
much
at
least
was
true
the
rest
was
a
lie
so
outrageous
that
she
could
feel
herself
blushing
hotly
in
the
dark
all
right
her
mom
said
i
just
wanted
to
be
sure
because
if
your
dad
caught
you
going
on
dates
at
your
age
he'd
be
mad
almost
as
an
afterthought
she
added
i
would
be
too
yeah
i
know
bev
said
still
looking
into
the
dining
room
she
did
know
yet
here
she
was
not
with
one
boy
but
six
of
them
in
a
house
where
the
parents
were
gone
she
saw
ben
looking
at
her
anxiously
and
she
sketched
a
smiling
little
salute
at
him
he
blushed
but
gave
her
the
little
salute
right
back
are
any
of
your
girlfriends
there
what
girlfriends
mamma
um
patty
o'haras
here
and
ellie
geiger
i
think
she
playing
shuffleboard
downstairs
the
facility
with
which
the
lies
came
from
her
lips
made
her
ashamed
she
wished
she
were
talking
to
her
father
she
would
have
been
more
scared
but
less
ashamed
she
supposed
she
really
wasn't
a
very
good
girl
i
love
you
mamma
she
said
same
goes
back
to
you
bev
her
mother
paused
briefly
and
added
be
careful
the
paper
says
there
may
be
another
one
a
boy
named
patrick
hockstetter
he
missing
did
you
know
him
bevvi
she
closed
her
eyes
briefly
no
mom
well
goodbye
then
bye
she
joined
the
others
at
the
table
and
for
an
hour
they
played
monopoly
stan
was
the
big
winner
jews
are
very
good
at
making
money
stan
said
putting
a
hotel
on
atlantic
avenue
and
two
more
green
houses
on
ventnor
avenue
everybody
knows
that
jesus
make
me
jewis
ben
said
promptly
and
everyone
laughed
ben
was
almost
broke
beverly
glanced
across
the
table
from
time
to
time
at
bill
noting
his
clean
hands
his
blue
eyes
the
fine
red
hair
as
he
moved
the
little
silver
shoe
he
was
using
as
a
marker
around
the
board
she
thought
zf
he
held
my
hand
i
think
i'd
be
so
glad
i'd
probably
die
a
warm
light
seemed
to
glow
briefly
in
her
chest
and
she
smiled
secretly
down
at
her
hands
the
evening
finale
was
almost
anticlimactic
ben
took
one
of
zack
chisels
from
the
shelf
and
used
a
hammer
to
strike
the
molds
on
the
cutlines
they
opened
easily
two
small
silver
balls
fell
out
in
one
they
could
faintly
see
part
of
a
date
in
the
other
wavery
lines
beverly
thought
were
the
remnants
of
lady
liberty
hair
they
looked
at
them
without
speaking
for
a
moment
and
then
stan
picked
one
up
pretty
smal
he
said
so
was
the
rock
in
david
sung
when
he
went
up
against
goliath
mike
said
they
look
powerful
to
me
ben
found
himself
nodding
they
did
to
him
as
well
we're
all
dddone
bill
asked
all
done
ben
said
here
he
tossed
the
second
slug
to
bill
who
was
so
surprised
he
almost
fumbled
it
the
slugs
went
around
the
circle
each
of
them
looked
closely
at
both
marvelling
at
their
roundness
weight
actuality
when
they
came
back
to
ben
he
held
them
in
his
hand
and
then
looked
at
bill
what
do
we
do
with
them
now
gggive
them
to
bbeverly
n
he
looked
at
her
his
face
was
kind
enough
but
stern
bbbev
we've
been
thruh
through
this
aaalready
and
tll
do
it
she
said
til
shoot
the
goddamned
things
when
the
time
comes
zf
it
comes
i'll
probably
get
us
all
killed
but
i'll
do
it
i
don't
want
to
take
them
home
though
one
of
my
father
parents
might
find
them
then
i'd
be
in
dutch
don't
you
have
a
secret
hiding
place
richie
asked
criminy
i
got
four
or
five
tve
got
a
place
beverly
said
there
was
a
small
slit
in
the
bottom
of
her
box
spring
where
she
sometimes
stashed
cigarettes
comic
books
and
just
lately
film
and
fashion
magazines
but
nothing
i'd
trust
for
something
like
this
you
keep
them
bill
until
it
time
anyway
you
keep
them
okay
bill
said
mildly
and
just
then
lights
splashed
into
the
driveway
holy
cruhcrow
they're
eeearly
llet
get
out
of
hhere
they
were
just
sitting
down
around
the
monopoly
board
again
when
sharon
denbrough
opened
the
kitchen
door
richie
rolled
his
eyes
and
mimed
wiping
sweat
from
his
forehead
the
others
laughed
heartily
richie
had
gotten
off
a
good
one
a
moment
later
she
came
in
your
dad
waiting
for
your
friends
in
the
car
bill
oo
okay
mmom
bill
said
w
we
were
juhjust
fffinishing
aanyway
who
won
sharon
asked
smiling
bright
eyed
at
bill
little
friends
the
girl
was
going
to
be
very
pretty
she
thought
she
supposed
in
another
year
or
two
the
children
would
have
to
be
chaperoned
if
there
were
going
to
be
girls
instead
of
just
the
regular
gang
of
boys
but
surely
it
was
still
too
soon
to
worry
about
sex
rearing
its
ugly
head
ststan
wuhwuhwon
bill
said
juhjuhjews
are
very
¢
g
good
at
m
making
money
bill
she
cried
horrified
and
blushing
and
then
she
looked
around
at
them
amazed
as
they
roared
with
laughter
stan
included
amazement
turned
to
something
like
fear
although
she
said
nothing
of
tis
to
her
husband
later
in
bed
there
was
a
feeling
in
the
air
like
static
electricity
only
somehow
much
more
powerful
much
more
scary
she
felt
that
if
she
touched
any
of
them
she
would
receive
a
walloping
shock
what
happened
to
them
she
thought
dismayed
and
perhaps
she
even
opened
her
mouth
to
say
something
like
that
then
bill
was
saying
he
was
sorry
but
still
with
that
devilish
glint
in
his
eye
and
stan
was
saying
that
was
all
right
it
was
just
a
joke
they
laid
on
him
from
time
to
time
and
she
found
herself
too
confused
to
say
anything
at
all
but
she
felt
relieved
when
the
children
were
gone
and
her
own
puzzling
stuttering
son
had
gone
to
his
room
and
turned
off
the
light
the
day
that
the
loser
club
finally
met
it
in
facetoface
combat
the
day
it
almost
had
ben
hanscom
guts
for
garters
was
july
th
it
was
hot
and
muggy
and
still
ben
remembered
the
weather
clearly
enough
it
had
been
the
last
day
of
the
hot
weather
after
that
day
a
long
spell
of
cool
and
cloudy
had
come
in
they
arrived
at
neibolt
street
around
ten
that
morning
bill
riding
richie
double
on
silver
ben
with
his
ample
buttocks
spilling
over
either
side
of
the
sagging
seat
on
his
raleigh
beverly
came
down
neibolt
street
on
her
girl
schwinn
her
red
hair
held
back
from
her
forehead
by
a
green
band
it
streamed
out
behind
her
mike
came
by
himself
and
about
five
minutes
later
stan
and
eddie
walked
up
together
hhhow

if
i
roll
over
on
that
side
while
im
sleeping
did
you
bring
the
stuff
there
was
a
canvaswrapped
bundle
in
silver
bikebasket
bill
took
it
out
and
unwrapped
it
he
handed
the
slingshot
to
beverly
who
took
it
with
a
little
grimace
but
said
nothing
there
was
also
a
tin
sucrets
box
in
the
bundle
bill
opened
it
and
showed
them
the
two
silver
balls
they
looked
at
them
silently
gathered
close
together
on
the
balding
lawn
on
neibolt
street
a
lawn
where
only
weeds
seemed
to
grow
bill
richie
and
eddie
had
seen
the
house
before
the
others
hadn't
and
they
looked
at
it
curiously
the
windows
look
tike
eyes
stan
thought
and
his
hand
went
to
the
paperback
book
in
his
back
pocket
he
touched
it
for
luck
he
carried
the
book
with
him
almost
everywhere
it
was
m
k
handey
guide
to
north
american
birds
they
look
like
dirty
blind
eyes
it
stinks
beverly
thought
z
can
smell
it
but
not
with
my
nose
not
exactly
mike
thought
[t
like
that
time
out
where
the
ironworks
used
to
be
it
has
the
same
feel
as
if
it
telling
us
to
step
on
in
this
is
one
of
its
places
all
right
ben
thought
one
of
the
places
like
the
morlock
holes
where
it
goes
out
and
comes
back
in
and
it
knows
we're
out
here
it
waiting
for
us
to
come
in
yuhyuh
you
all
still
want
to
bill
asked
they
looked
back
at
him
pale
and
solemn
no
one
said
no
eddie
fumbled
his
aspirator
out
of
his
pocket
and
took
a
long
whooping
gasp
at
it
gimme
some
of
that
richie
said
eddie
looked
at
him
surprsed
waiting
for
the
punchline
richie
held
out
his
hand
no
fake
jake
can
i
have
some
eddie
shrugged
with
his
good
shoulder
an
oddly
disjointed
movement
and
handed
it
over
richie
triggered
the
aspirator
and
breathed
deep
needed
that
he
said
and
handed
it
back
he
was
coughing
a
little
but
his
eyes
were
sober
me
to
stan
said
okay
'
so
one
after
another
they
used
eddie
aspirator
when
it
came
back
to
him
eddie
jammed
it
in
his
back
pocket
where
the
nozzle
stuck
out
they
turned
to
look
at
the
house
again
does
anybody
live
on
this
street
beverly
asked
in
a
low
voice
not
this
end
of
it
mike
said
not
anymore
i
guess
there
are
still
bums
sometimes
guys
that
come
through
on
the
freights
they
wouldn't
see
anything
stan
said
they'd
be
safe
most
of
them
anyway
he
looked
at
bill
can
any
grownups
at
all
see
it
do
you
think
bill
don't
nuh
know
bill
said
there
must
be
suhsuhsome
i
wish
we
could
meet
one
richie
said
glumly
this
really
isn't
a
job
for
kids
you
know
what
i
mean
bill
knew
whenever
the
hardy
boys
got
into
trouble
fenton
hardy
was
around
to
bail
them
out
same
with
rick
brant
dad
in
the
rick
brant
science
adventures
shit
even
nancy
drew
had
a
father
who
would
show
up
in
the
nick
of
time
if
the
bad
guys
tied
her
up
and
threw
her
into
an
abandoned
mine
or
something
ought
to
be
a
grownup
along
richie
said
looking
at
the
closed
house
with
hs
peeling
paint
its
duty
windows
its
shadowy
porch
he
sighed
tiredly
for
a
moment
ben
felt
their
resolution
falter
then
bill
said
cuhcuhhome
aaaaround
hhere
look
at
ththis
they
walked
around
to
the
left
side
of
the
porch
where
the
skirting
was
torn
off
the
brambly
runtothewild
roses
were
still
there
and
those
it
had
touched
when
it
climbed
out

black
and
dead
tt
just

them

horrified
bill
nodded

nobody
replied
they
weren't
sure
even
though
all
of
them
knew
by
bill
face
that
he
would
go
on
without
them
they
weren't
sure
there
was
also
a
species
of
shame
on
bill
face
as
he
had
told
them
before
george
hadn't
been
their
brother

throat
working
and
then
he
nodded
he
handed
the
tin
box
to
beverly
are
you
sure
bill
sh
sh
sure
she
nodded
at
once
horrified
by
the
responsibility
and
bewitched
by
his
trust
she
opened
the
box
took
out
the
slugs
and
slipped
one
into
the
right
front
pocket
of
her
jeans
the
other
she
socketed
in
the
bullseye
rubber
cup
and
it
was
by
the
cup
that
she
carried
the
slingshot
she
could
feel
the
ball
tightly
enclosed
in
her
fist
cold
at
first
and
then
warming

beautiful

back

mike
asked
n
bill
said
briefly
it
hhhere
ben
believed
he
was
right
the
house
at
neibolt
street
seemed
to
be
encased
in
a
poisonous
envelope
it
could
not
be
seen
but
it
could
be
felt
he
licked
his
lips
you
ruhruhread
bill
asked
them
they
all
looked
back
at
him
ready
bill
richie
said
cuhcome

bill

behind
me
bbeverly
he
dropped
to
his
knees
crawled
through
the
blighted
rosebushes
and
under
the
porch
they
went
this
way
bill
beverly
ben
eddie
richie
stan
mike
the
leaves
under
the
porch
crackled
and
puffed
up
a
sour
old
smell
ben
wrinkled
his
nose
had
he
ever
smelled
fallen
leaves
like
these
he
thought
not
and
then
an
unpleasant
idea
struck
him
they
smelled
the
way
he
imagined
a
mummy
would
smell
just
after
its
discoverer
had
levered
open
its
coffin
all
dust
and
bitter
ancient
tannic
acid
bill
had
reached
the
broken
cellar
window
and
was
looking
into
the
cellar
beverly
crawled
up
beside
him
you
see
anything
bill
shook
his
head
but
that
ddoesn't
mmmean
nuhhuthin
there
ilook
there
the
ccoał
pile
me
and
rrrichie
used
to
get
ow
out
ben
who
was
looking
between
them
saw
it
he
was
becoming
excited
as
well
as
afraid
now
and
he
welcomed
the
excitement
instinctively
recognizing
the
fact
that
it
could
be
a
tool
seeing
the
coakpile
was
a
little
like
seeing
a
great
landmark
about
which
you
had
only
read
or
heard
from
others
bill
turned
around
and
slipped
lithely
through
the
window
beverly
gave
ben
the
bullseye
folding
his
hand
over
the
cup
and
ball
nestled
in
it
give
it
to
me
the
second
i'm
down
she
said
the
second
got
you
she
slipped
down
as
easily
and
lithely
as
bill
had
before
her
there
was
for
ben
at
least
one
heartstopping
instant
when
her
blouse
pulled
out
of
her
jeans
and
he
saw
her
flat
white
belly
then
there
was
the
thrill
of
her
hands
over
his
as
he
handed
the
slingshot
down
okay
i've
got
it
come
on
ben
turned
around
himself
and
began
to
wriggle
through
the
window
he
should
have
forseen
what
happened
next
it
was
really
inevitable
he
got
stuck
his
fanny
bound
up
against
the
rectangular
cellar
window
and
he
couldn't
go
in
any
further
he
started
to
pull
himself
out
and
realized
horrified
that
he
could
do
it
but
was
very
apt
to
yank
his
pants
and
perhaps
his
underpants
as
well
down
to
his
knees
when
he
did
and
there
he
would
be
with
his
extremely
large
ass
practically
in
his
beloved
face
hurry
u
eddie
said
ben
pushed
grimly
with
both
hands
for
a
moment
he
still
couldn't
move
and
then
his
butt
popped
through
the
windowhole
his
bluejeans
dragged
painfully
up
into
his
crotch
squashing
his
balls
the
top
of
the
window
rucked
his
shin
all
the
way
up
to
his
shoulderblades
now
his
gut
was
stuck
suck
in
haystack
richie
said
giggling
hysterically
you
better
suck
in
or
we'll
have
to
send
mike
after
his
dad
chainfall
to
pull
you
out
again
beepbeep
richie
ben
said
through
gritted
teeth
he
sucked
his
belly
in
as
much
as
he
could
he
had
never
really
realized
just
how
big
his
stupid
stomach
was
until
this
supremely
embarrassing
moment
he
moved
a
little
further
then
stopped
again
he
turned
his
head
as
far
as
he
could
fighting
panic
and
claustrophobia
his
face
had
gone
a
bright
sweaty
red
the
sour
smell
of
the
leaves
was
heavy
in
his
nostrils
cloying
bill
can
you
guys
pull
me
he
felt
bill
grasp
one
of
his
ankles
beverly
the
other
he
sucked
his
belly
in
as
far
as
he
could
a
moment
later
he
came
tumbling
through
the
window
bill
grabbed
him
both
of
them
almost
fell
over
ben
couldn't
look
at
bev
he
had
never
in
his
life
been
as
embarrassed
as
he
was
at
that
moment
yyyou
okay
mm
man
yeah
bill
laughed
shakily
beverly
joined
him
and
then
ben
was
able
to
laugh
a
little
too
although
it
would
be
years
before
he
could
see
anything
remotely
funny
in
what
had
happened
he
richie
called
down
eddie
needs
help
okay
oookay
bill
and
ben
took
up
positions
below
the
window
eddie
came
through
on
his
back
bill
got
his
legs
just
above
the
knees
watch
what
you're
doing
eddie
said
in
a
querulous
nervous
voice
t'm
ticklish
ramon
ees
plenny
teekeleesh
senhor
richie
voice
called
down
ben
got
eddie
around
the
waist
trying
to
keep
his
hand
away
from
the
cast
and
the
sling
the
two
of
them
manhandled
eddie
through
the
cellar
window
ike
a
corpse
eddie
cried
out
once
but
that
was
all
eh
eh
eddie
yea
eddie
said
okay
no
big
deal
but
large
drops
of
sweat
stood
out
on
his
forehead
and
he
was
breathing
in
quick
rasps
his
eyes
darted
around
the
cellar
bill
stepped
back
again
beverly
stood
near
him
now
holding
the
bullseye
by
the
shaft
and
the
cup
ready
to
fire
if
necessary
her
eyes
swept
the
cellar
constantly
richie
came
through
next
followed
by
stan
and
mike
both
of
the
latter
moved
with
a
smooth
grace
that
ben
deeply
envied
then
they
were
all
down
down
in
the
cellar
where
bill
and
richie
had
seen
it
only
a
month
before
the
room
was
dim
but
not
dark
dusky
light
shafted
in
through
the
windows
and
pooled
on
the
dirt
floor
the
cellar
seemed
very
big
to
ben
almost
too
big
as
if
he
were
witnessing
an
optical
illusion
of
some
sort
dusty
rafters
crisscrossed
overhead
the
furnacepipes
were
rusty
some
sort
of
duty
white
cloth
hung
from
the
waterpipes
in
dirty
strings
and
strands
the
smell
was
down
here
too
a
dirty
yellow
smell
ben
thought
it
here
all
right
oh
yeah
bill
started
toward
the
stairs
the
others
fell
in
behind
him
he
halted
at
their
foot
and
glanced
underneath
he
reached
under
with
one
foot
and
kickpawed
something
out
they
looked
at
it
wordlessly
it
was
a
white
clownglove
now
streaked
with
dirt
and
dust
uhuh
upstairs
he
said
they
went
up
and
emerged
into
a
dirty
kitchen
one
plain
straight
backed
chair
stood
marooned
in
the
center
of
the
humped
hillocky
linoleum
that
was
it
for
furniture
there
were
empty
liquor
bottles
in
one
corner
ben
could
see
others
in
the
pantry
he
could
smell
booze
wine
mostly
and
old
stale
cigarettes
those
smells
were
dominant
but
that
other
smell
was
there
too
it
was
getting
stronger
all
the
time
beverly
went
to
the
cupboards
and
opened
one
of
them
she
screamed
piercingly
as
a
blackish
brown
norway
rat
tumbled
out
almost
into
her
face
it
struck
the
counter
with
a
plop
and
glared
around
at
them
with
its
black
eyes
still
screaming
beverly
raised
the
bullseye
and
pulled
the
sling
back
no
bill
roared
she
turned
her
pale
terrified
face
toward
him
then
she
nodded
and
relaxed
her
arm
the
silver
ball
unfired
but
ben
thought
she
had
been
very
very
close
she
backed
up
slowly
ran
into
ben
jumped
he
put
an
arm
around
her
tight
the
rat
scurried
down
the
length
of
the
counter
jumped
to
the
floor
ran
into
the
pantry
and
was
gone
tt

his
head

there
was
a
mewling
from
another
cupboard
richie
walked
toward
it
don't
get
too
close
stan
barked
it
might
richie
looked
inside
and
an
expression
of
sick
disgust
crossed
his
face
he
slammed
the
cupboard
shut
with
a
bang
that
produced
a
dead
echo
in
the
empty
house
a
litter
richie
sounded
ill
biggest
litter
i
ever
saw
anyone
ever
saw
probably
he
rubbed
the
back
of
his
hand
across
his
mouth
there
hundreds
of
them
in
there
he
looked
at
them
his
mouth
twitching
a
little
on
one
side
their
fails
they
were
all
tangled
up
bill
knotted
together
he
grimaced
like
snakes
they
looked
at
the
cupboard
door
the
mewling
was
muffled
but
still
audible
rats
ben
thought
looking
at
bill
white
face
and
over
bill
shoulder
mike
ashygray
one
everyone
ascared

cccome
o
bill
said
hhere
on
nuhnuhneibolt
street
the
fffun
just
neh
hever
stops
they
went
down
the
front
hall
here
the
unlovely
smells
of
rotting
plaster
and
old
urine
were
intermixed
they
were
able
to
look
out
at
the
street
through
dirty
panes
of
glass
and
see
their
bikes
bev
and
ben
were
heeled
over
on
their
kickstands
bill
leaned
against
a
stunted
maple
tree
to
ben
the
bikes
looked
a
thousand
miles
away
like
things
seen
through
the
wrong
end
of
a
telescope
the
deserted
street
with
its
casual
patchings
of
asphalt
the
faded
humid
sky
the
steady
dingdingding
of
a
locomotive
running
on
a
siding
these
things
seemed
like
dreams
to
him
hallucinations
what
was
real
was
this
squalid
hallway
with
its
stinks
and
shadows
there
was
a
shatter
of
broken
brown
glass
in
one
corner
rheingold
bottles
in
the
other
corner
wet
and
swelled
was
a
digest
sized
girlybook
the
woman
on
the
cover
was
bent
over
a
chair
her
skirt
up
in
the
back
to
show
the
tops
of
her
fishnet
hose
and
her
black
panties

picture
did
not
look
particularly
sexy
to
ben
nor
did
it
embarrass
him
that
beverly
had
also
glanced
at
it
moisture
had
yellowed
the
woman
skin
and
moisture
had
humped
the
cover
in
ripples
that
became
wrinkles
on
her
face
her
salacious
wink
had
become
the
leer
of
a
dead
whore
years
later
as
ben
recounted
this
bev
suddenly
cried
out
startling
all
of
them
they
were
not
so
much
listening
to
the
story
as
reliving
it
it
was
her
bev
yelled
mrs
kersh
it
was
her’
as
ben
looked
the
young/old
crone
on
the
girlybook
cover
winked
at
him
she
wiggled
her
fanny
in
an
obscene
come
on
cold
all
over
yet
sweating
ben
looked
away
bill
pushed
open
a
door
on
the
left
and
they
followed
him
into
a
vaultlike
room
that
might
once
have
been
a
parlor
a
crumpled
pair
of
green
pants
was
hung
over
the
lightfixture
which
depended
from
the
ceiling
like
the
cellar
this
room
seemed
much
too
big
to
ben
almost
as
long
as
a
freightcar
much
too
long
for
a
house
as
small
as
this
one
had
appeared
from
the
outside
oh
but
that
was
outside
a
new
voice
spoke
inside
his
mind
it
was
a
jocular
squealing
voice
and
ben
realized
with
sudden
numbing
certainty
that
he
was
hearing
pennywise
itself
pennywise
was
speaking
to
him
on
some
crazy
mental
radio
outside
things
always
look
smaller
than
they
really
are
don't
they
ben
go
awa
he
whispered
richie
turned
to
look
at
him
his
face
still
strained
and
pale
you
say
something
ben
shook
his
head
the
voice
was
gone
that
was
an
important
thing
a
good
thing
yet
outside
he
had
understood
this
house
was
a
special
place
a
kind
of
station
one
of
the
places
in
derry
one
of
the
many
perhaps
from
which
it
was
able
to
find
its
way
into
the
overworld
this
stinking
rotted
house
where
everything
was
somehow
wrong
it
wasn't
just
that
it
seemed
too
big
the
angles
were
wrong
the
perspective
crazy
ben
was
standing
just
inside
the
door
between
the
parlor
and
the
hallway
and
the
others
were
moving
away
from
him
across
a
space
that
now
looked
almost
as
big
as
bassey
park
but
as
they
moved
away
they
seemed
to
grow
larger
instead
of
smaller
the
floor
seemed
to
slope
and
mike
turned
ben
he
called
and
ben
saw
alarm
on
his
face
catch
up
we're
losing
you
he
could
barely
hear
the
last
word
it
trailed
away
as
if
the
others
were
being
swept
off
on
a
fast
train
suddenly
terrified
he
began
to
run
the
door
behind
him
swept
shut
with
a
muffled
tang
he
screamed
and
something
seemed
to
sweep
through
the
air
just
behind
him
ruffling
his
shirt
he
looked
back
but
there
was
nothing
there
that
did
not
change
his
belief
however
that
something
had
been
he
caught
up
with
the
others
he
was
panting
out
of
breath
and
would
have
sworn
he
had
run
half
a
mile
at
least
but
when
he
looked
back
the
parlor
far
wall
was
not
ten
feet
away
mike
grasped
his
shoulder
hard
enough
to
hurt
you
scared
me
man
he
said
richie
stan
and
eddie
were
looking
at
mike
questioningly
he
looked
small
mike
said
like
he
was
a
mile
away
bill
bill
looked
back
we
gotta
make
sure
everybody
stays
close
ben
panted
this
place
it
like
the
funhouse
in
a
carnival
or
something
we'll
get
lost
i
think
it
wants
us
to
get
lost
to
get
separated
bill
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
lips
thin
all
right
he
said
we
aall
stay
club
cluhhose
no
ss
stragglers
they
nodded
back
frightened
clustered
outside
the
hall
door
stan
hand
groped
at
the
birdbook
in
his
back
pocket
eddie
was
holding
his
aspirator
in
one
hand
crunching
it
loosening
up
then
crunching
it
again
like
a
ninetyeightpound
weakling
trying
to
build
up
his
muscles
with
a
tennis
ball
bill
opened
the
door
and
here
was
another
narrower
hall
the
wallpaper
which
showed
runners
of
roses
and
elves
wearing
green
caps
was
falling
away
from
the
spongy
plaster
in
draggling
leaves
yellow
waterstains
spread
in
senile
rings
on
the
ceiling
overhead
a
scummy
wash
of
light
fell
through
a
dirty
window
at
the
end
of
the
hall
abruptly
the
corridor
seemed
to
elongate
the
ceiling
rose
and
then
began
to
diminish
above
them
like
some
weird
rocket
the
doors
grew
with
the
ceiling
pulled
up
like
taffy
the
faces
of
the
elves
grew
long
and
became
alien
their
eyes
bleeding
black
holes
stan
shrieked
and
clapped
his
hands
to
his
eyes
ththhit
not
ruhruhruhreal
bill
screamed
tt
is
stan
screamed
back
his
small
closed
fists
plugging
his
eyes
real
you
know
itis
god
i'm
going
crazy
this
is
crazy
this
is
crazy
wuhwuhwatch
bill
bellowed
at
stan
at
all
of
them
and
ben
his
head
reeling
watched
as
bill
bent
down
coiled
and
suddenly
flung
himself
upward
his
closed
left
fist
struck
nothing
nothing
at
all
but
there
was
a
heavy
crrrack
sound
plaster
dust
puffed
from
a
place
where
there
was
no
longer
any
ceiling
and
then
there
was
the
hallway
was
just
a
hallway
again
narrow
lowceilinged
dirty
but
the
walls
no
longer
stretched
up
into
forever
there
was
only
bill
looking
at
them
and
nursing
his
bleeding
hand
which
was
floury
with
plaster
dust
overhead
was
the
clear
mark
his
fist
had
made
in
the
soft
plaster
of
the
ceiling
nnnot
ruhrubreal
he
said
to
stan
to
all
of
them
just
a
fffalse
ffuhface
like
a
hub
hub
hub
halloween
mub
mulhask
to
you
mayb
stan
said
dully
his
face
was
shocked
and
horrified
he
looked
around
as
if
no
longer
sure
where
he
was
looking
at
him
smelling
the
sour
reek
coming
out
of
his
pores
ben
who
had
been
overjoyed
at
bill
victory
got
scared
all
over
again
stan
was
close
to
cracking
up
soon
he
would
go
into
hysterics
begin
to
scream
perhaps
and
what
would
happen
then
to
you
stan
said
again
but
if
i'd
tried
that
nothing
would
have
happened
because
you've
got
your
brother
bill
but
i
don't
have
anything
he
looked
around
first
back
toward
the
parlor
which
had
taken
on
a
somber
brown
atmosphere
so
thick
and
smoggy
hey
could
barely
see
the
door
through
which
they
had
entered
it
to
this
hall
which
was
bright
but
somehow
dark
somehow
filthy
somehow
utterly
mad
elves
capered
on
the
decaying
wallpaper
under
runners
of
roses
sun
glared
on
the
panes
of
the
window
at
the
end
of
the
hall
and
ben
knew
that
if
they
went
down
there
they
would
see
dead
flies
more
broken
glass
and
then
what
the
floorboards
spreading
apart
spilling
them
into
a
dead
darkness
where
grasping
fingers
waited
to
catch
them
stan
was
right
god
why
had
they
come
into
its
lair
with
nothing
but
their
two
stupid
silver
slugs
and
a
fucking
slingshot
he
saw
stan
panic
leap
from
one
of
them
to
the
next
to
the
next
like
a
grassfire
driven
by
a
hot
wind
it
widened
in
eddie
eyes
dopped
bev
mouth
into
a
wounded
gasp
made
richie
push
his
glasses
up
with
both
hands
and
stare
around
as
if
followed
from
close
behind
by
a
fiend
they
trembled
on
the
brink
of
flight
bill
warning
to
stay
together
almost
forgotten
they
were
listening
to
galeforce
panicwinds
blowing
between
their
ears
as
if
in
a
dream
ben
heard
miss
davies
the
assistant
librarian
reading
to
the
little
ones
who
is
that
triptrapping
on
my
bridge
and
he
saw
them
the
little
ones
the
babies
leaning
forward
heir
faces
still
and
solemn
their
eyes
reflecting
the
eternal
fascination
of
the
fairystory
would
the
monster
be
bested
or
would
it
feed
don't
have
anything
stan
uris
wailed
and
he
seemed
very
small
almost
small
enough
to
slip
through
one
of
the
cracks
in
the
hallway
plank
flooring
like
a
human
letter
you
got
your
brother
man
but
i
don't
have
anything
you
duhduhduhd
bill
yelled
back
he
grabbed
stan
and
ben
felt
sure
he
was
going
to
bust
him
one
and
his
thoughts
moaned
no
bill
please
that
henry
way
if
you
do
that
it'll
kill
us
all
right
now
but
bill
didn't
hit
stan
he
whirled
him
around
with
rough
hands
and
tore
the
paperback
from
the
back
pocket
of
stan
jeans
gimme
it
stan
screamed
beginning
to
cry
the
others
stood
stunned
shrinking
away
from
bill
whose
eyes
now
seemed
to
actually
burn
his
forehead
glowed
like
a
lamp
and
he
held
the
book
out
to
stan
like
a
priest
holding
out
a
cross
to
ward
off
a
vampire
you
guhguhgot
your
bbbibirbir
he
turned
his
head
up
the
cords
in
his
neck
standing
out
like
cables
his
adam
apple
like
an
arrowhead
buried
in
his
throat
ben
was
filled
with
both
fear
and
pity
for
his
friend
bill
denbrough
but
there
was
also
a
strong
sense
of
wonderful
relief
had
he
doubted
bill
had
any
of
them
oh
bill
say
it
please
can't
you
say
it
and
somehow
bill
did
you
got
your
buhbuhbuhbirds
your
buhbuhbird
he
thrust
the
book
at
stan
stan
took
it
and
looked
at
bill
dumbly
tears
glimmered
on
his
cheeks
he
held
the
book
so
tightly
that
his
fingers
were
white
bill
looked
at
him
then
at
the
others
cuhcuhhome
on
he
said
again
will
the
birds
work
stan
asked
his
voice
was
low
husky
they
worked
in
the
standpipe
didn't
they
bev
asked
him
stan
looked
at
her
uncertainly
richie
clapped
him
on
the
shoulder
come
on
starki
he
said
is
you
a
man
or
is
you
a
mouse
must
be
a
man
stan
said
shakily
and
wiped
tears
from
his
face
with
the
heel
of
his
left
hand
so
far
as
i
know
mice
don't
shit
their
pants
they
laughed
and
ben
could
have
sworn
he
felt
the
house
pulling
away
from
them
from
that
sound
mike
turned
that
big
room
the
one
we
just
came
through
look
they
looked
the
parlor
was
now
almost
black
it
was
not
smoke
nor
any
kind
of
gas
it
was
just
blackness
a
nearly
solid
blackness
the
air
had
been
robbed
of
its
light
the
blackness
seemed
to
roll
and
flex
as
they
stared
into
it
to
almost
coalesce
into
faces
come
ohohon
they
turned
away
from
the
black
and
walked
down
the
hall
three
doors
opened
off
it
two
with
dirty
white
porcelain
doorknobs
the
third
with
only
a
hole
where
the
knob
shaft
had
been
bill
grabbed
the
first
knob
turned
it
and
pushed
the
door
open
bev
crowded
up
next
to
him
raising
the
bullseye
ben
drew
back
aware
that
the
others
were
doing
the
same
crowding
behind
bill
like
frightened
quail
it
was
a
bedroom
empty
save
for
one
stained
mattress
the
rusty
ghosts
of
the
coils
in
a
box
spring
long
departed
were
tattooed
into
the
mattress
yellow
hide
outside
the
room
one
window
sunflowers
dipped
and
nodded
there
nothing
bill
began
and
then
the
mattress
began
to
bulge
in
and
out
rhythmically
it
suddenly
ripped
straight
down
the
middle
a
black
sticky
fluid
began
to
spill
out
staining
the
mattress
and
then
running
over
the
floor
toward
the
doorway
it
came
in
long
ropy
tendrils
shut
it
bill
richie
shouted
shut
the
fuckin
door
bill
slammed
it
shut
looked
around
at
them
and
nodded
come
on
he
had
barely
touched
the
knob
of
the
second
door
this
one
on
the
other
side
of
the
narrow
hall
when
the
buzzing
scream
began
behind
the
cheap
wood
even
bill
drew
back
from
that
rising
inhuman
cry
ben
felt
the
sound
might
drive
him
mad
his
mind
visualized
a
giant
cricket
behind
the
door
like
something
from
a
movie
where
radiation
made
all
the
bugs
get
big
the
beginning
of
the
end
maybe
or
the
black
scorpion
or
that
one
about
the
ants
in
the
los
angeles
stormdrains
he
could
not
have
run
even
if
that
buzzing
rugose
horror
had
splintered
the
panels
of
the
door
and
begun
caressing
him
with
its
great
hairy
legs
beside
him
he
was
dimly
aware
that
eddie
was
breathing
in
hacking
gasps
the
scream
rose
in
pitch
never
losing
that
buzzing
insectile
quality
bill
fell
back
another
step
no
blood
in
his
face
now
his
eyes
bulging
his
lips
only
a
purple
scar
below
his
nose
shoot
it
beverly
ben
heard
himself
cry
shoot
it
through
the
door
shoot
it
before
it
can
get
us
and
the
sun
fell
through
the
dirty
window
at
the
end
of
the
hall
a
heavy
feverish
weight
beverly
raised
the
bullseye
like
a
girl
in
a
dream
as
the
buzzing
scream
rose
louder
louder
louder
but
before
she
could
pull
the
sling
back
mike
was
shouting
no
no
don't
bev
oh
gosh
i'll
be
dipped
and
incredibly
mike
was
laughing
he
pushed
forward
grabbed
the
knob
turned
it
and
shoved
the
door
open
it
came
free
of
the
swollen
jamb
with
a
brief
grinding
noise
it
a
mooseblower
just
a
mooseblower
that
all
something
to
scare
the
crows
the
room
was
an
empty
box
lying
on
the
floor
was
a
sterno
can
with
both
ends
cut
off
in
the
middle
strung
tight
and
knotted
outside
holes
punched
in
the
can
sides
was
a
waxed
length
of
string
although
there
was
no
breeze
in
the
room
the
one
window
was
shut
and
indifferently
boarded
over
letting
light
pass
only
in
chinks
and
rays
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
the
buzzing
was
coming
from
the
can
mike
walked
to
it
and
fetched
it
a
solid
kick
the
buzzing
stopped
as
the
can
tumbled
into
a
far
corner
just
a
mooseblower
he
said
to
the
others
as
if
apologizing
we
put
cm
on
the
scarecrows
it
nothing
only
a
cheap
trick
but
j
ain't
a
crow
he
looked
at
bill
not
laughing
anymore
but
smiling
still
tm
still
scared
of
it
i
guess
we
all
are
but
it
scared
of
us
too
tell
you
the
truth
i
think
it
scared
pretty
bad
bill
nodded
hi
do
to
he
said
they
went
down
to
the
door
at
the
end
of
the
hall
and
as
ben
watched
bill
hook
his
finger
into
the
hole
where
the
doorknob
shaft
had
been
he
understood
that
this
was
where
it
was
going
to
end
there
would
be
no
trick
behind
this
door
the
smell
was
worse
now
and
that
thundery
feeling
of
two
opposing
powers
swirling
around
them
was
much
stronger
he
glanced
at
eddie
one
arm
in
a
sling
his
good
hand
clutching
his
aspirator
he
looked
at
bev
on
his
other
side
whitefaced
holding
the
slingshot
up
like
a
wishbone
he
thought
if
we
have
to
run
i'll
try
to
protect
you
beverly
i
swear
i'll
try
she
might
have
heard
his
thought
because
she
turned
toward
him
and
offered
him
a
strained
smile
ben
smiled
back
bill
pulled
the
door
open
its
hinges
uttered
a
dull
scream
and
then
were
silent
it
was
a
bathroom
but
something
was
wrong
with
it
someone
broke
something
in
here
was
all
that
ben
could
make
out
at
first
not
a
booze
bottle
what
white
chips
and
shards
glimmering
wickedly
lay
strewn
everywhere
then
he
understood
it
was
the
crowning
insanity
he
laughed
richie
joined
him
somebody
must
have
let
the
granddaddy
of
all
farts
eddie
said
and
mike
began
to
giggle
and
nod
his
head
stan
was
smiling
a
little
only
bill
and
beverly
remained
grim
the
white
pieces
littered
across
the
floor
were
shards
of
porcelain
the
toiletbowl
had
exploded
the
tank
stood
drunkenly
at
an
angle
in
a
puddle
of
water
saved
from
falling
over
by
the
fact
that
the
toilet
had
been
placed
in
one
comer
of
the
room
and
the
tank
had
landed
kitty
corner
they
crowded
in
behind
bill
and
beverly
their
feet
gritting
on
bits
of
porcelain
whatever
it
was
ben
thought
it
blew
that
poor
toilet
right
to
hell
he
had
a
vision
of
henry
bowers
dropping
two
or
three
of
his
ms
into
it
slamming
the
lid
down
then
bugging
out
in
a
hurry
he
couldn't
think
of
anything
else
short
of
dynamite
that
would
have
done
such
a
cataclysmic
job
there
were
a
few
chunks
but
damned
few
most
of
what
was
left
were
wickedlooking
slivers
like
blowgun
darts
the
wallpaper
roserunners
and
capering
elves
as
in
the
hall
was
peppered
with
holes
all
the
way
around
the
room
it
looked
like
shotgun
blasts
but
ben
knew
it
was
more
porcelain
driven
into
the
walls
by
the
force
of
the
explosion
there
was
a
bathtub
standing
on
claw
feet
with
generations
of
grimy
toejam
between
each
blunt
talon
ben
peeked
into
it
and
saw
a
tidalflat
of
silt
and
grit
on
the
bottom
a
rusty
showerhead
glared
down
from
above
there
was
a
basin
and
a
medicine
cabinet
standing
ajar
above
it
disclosing
empty
shelves
there
were
small
rustrings
on
these
shelves
where
bottles
had
once
stood
i
wouldn't
get
too
close
to
that
big
bill
richie
said
sharply
and
ben
looked
around
bill
was
approaching
the
mouth
of
the
drainhole
in
the
floor
over
which
the
toilet
had
once
sat
he
leaned
toward
it
and
then
turned
back
to
the
others
it
can
hhhear
the
pubpumping
mub
mub
machinery
just
like
in
the
buhbuh
harren
bev
drew
closer
to
bill
ben
followed
her
and
yes
he
could
hear
it
that
steady
thrumming
noise
except
echoing
up
through
the
pipes
it
didn't
sound
like
machinery
at
all
it
sounded
like
something
alive
thththis
is
wwwhere

frfrom
bill
said
his
face
was
still
deadly
pale
but
his
eyes
were
alight
with
excitement

from
that
dd

richie
was
nodding
we
were
in
the
cellar
but
that
isn't
where
i
was
it
came
down
the
stairs
because
this
is
where
it
could
get
out
and
it
did
this
'
beverly
asked
ibit
was
in
a
hhhurry
i
ththin
bill
said
gravely
ben
looked
into
the
pipe
it
was
about
three
feet
in
diameter
and
dark
as
a
nineshaft
the
inner
ceramic
surface
of
the
pipe
was
crusted
with
stuff
he
didn't
want
to
know
about
that
thrumming
sound
floated
up
hypnotically
and
suddenly
he
saw
something
he
did
not
see
it
with
his
physical
eyes
not
at
first
but
with
one
buried
deep
in
his
mind
it
was
rushing
toward
them
moving
at
expresstrain
speed
filling
the
throat
of
this
dark
pipe
from
side
to
side
it
was
in
its
own
form
now
whatever
that
might
be
it
would
take
some
shape
from
their
minds
when
it
got
here
it
was
coming
coming
up
from
its
own
foul
runs
and
black
catacombs
under
the
earth
its
eyes
glowing
a
feral
yellowish
green
coming
coming
it
was
coming
and
then
at
first
like
sparks
he
saw
its
eyes
down
in
that
darkness
they
took
shape
flaring
and
malignant
over
the
thrumming
sound
of
the
machinery
ben
could
now
hear
a
new
noise
whoooooooo
a
fetid
smell
belched
from
the
ragged
mouth
of
the
drain
pipe
and
he
fell
back
coughing
and
gagging
tt
coming
he
screamed
bill
i
saw
it
it
coming
beverly
raised
the
bullseye
goo
she
said
something
exploded
out
of
the
drainpipe
ben
trying
to
recall
that
first
confrontation
later
could
only
remember
a
silveryorange
shifting
shape
it
was
not
ghostly
it
was
solid
and
he
sensed
some
other
shape
some
real
and
ultimate
shape
behind
it
but
his
eyes
could
not
grasp
what
he
was
seeing
not
precisely
then
richie
was
stumbling
backward
his
face
a
scrawl
of
terror
screaming
over
and
over
again
the
werewolf
bil
it
the
werewolf
the
teenage
werewolf
and
suddenly
the
shape
locked
into
reality
for
ben
for
all
of
them
richie
it
became
their
it
the
werewolf
stood
poised
over
the
drainpipe
one
hairy
foot
on
either
side
of
where
the
toilet
had
once
been
its
green
eyes
glared
at
them
from
its
feral
face
its
muzzle
wrinkled
back
and
yellowishwhite
foam
seeped
through
its
teeth
it
uttered
a
shattering
growl
its
arms
pistoned
out
toward
beverly
the
cuffs
of
its
highschool
letter
jacket
pulling
back
from
its
furcovered
arms
its
smell
was
hot
and
raw
and
murderous
beverly
screamed
ben
grabbed
the
back
of
her
blouse
and
yanked
so
hard
that
the
seams
under
the
arms
tore
one
clawed
hand
swept
through
the
air
where
she
had
been
only
a
moment
before
beverly
went
stumbling
backwards
against
the
wall
the
silver
ball
popped
out
of
the
cup
of
the
bullseye
for
a
moment
it
glimmered
in
the
air
mike
quicker
than
quick
snatched
it
and
gave
it
back
to
her
shoot
it
baby
he
said
his
voice
was
qerfectly
calm
almost
serene
you
shoot
it
right
now
the
werewolf
uttered
a
shattering
roar
that
became
a
fleshfreezing
howl
its
snout
turned
up
toward
the
ceiling
the
howl
became
a
laugh
it
lunged
at
bill
as
bill
turned
to
look
at
beverly
ben
shoved
him
aside
and
bill
went
sprawling
shoot
it
be
richie
screamed
for
god
sake
shoot
i
the
werewolf
sprang
forward
and
there
was
no
question
in
ben
mind
then
or
later
that
it
knew
exactly
who
was
in
charge
here
bill
was
he
one
it
was
after
beverly
drew
and
fired
the
ball
flew
and
again
it
was
off
the
mark
but
this
time
there
was
no
saving
curve
it
missed
by
more
than
a
foot
punching
a
hole
in
the
wallpaper
above
the
tub
bill
his
arms
peppered
with
bits
of
porcelain
and
bleeding
in
a
dozen
pieces
uttered
a
screaming
curse
the
werewolf
s
head
snapped
around
its
gleaming
green
eyes
considered
beverly
not
thinking
ben
stepped
in
front
of
her
as
she
groped
in
her
pocket
for
the
other
silver
slug
the
jeans
she
wore
were
too
tight
she
had
donned
them
with
no
thought
of
provocation
it
was
just
that
like
the
shorts
she
had
worn
on
the
day
of
patrick
hockstetter
and
the
refrigerator
she
was
still
wearing
last
year
model
her
fingers
closed
on
the
ball
but
it
squirted
away
she
groped
again
and
got
it
she
pulled
it
turning
her
pocket
inside
out
and
spilling
fourteen
cents
the
stubs
of
two
aladdin
tickets
and
a
quantity
of
pocketlint
onto
the
floor
the
werewolf
lunged
at
ben
who
was
standing
protectively
in
front
of
her
and
blocking
her
field
of
fire
its
head
was
cocked
at
the
predator
deadly
questing
angle
its
jaws
snapping
ben
reached
blindly
for
it
there
seemed
to
be
no
room
in
his
reactions
now
for
terror
he
felt
a
clearheaded
sort
of
anger
instead
mixed
with
bewilderment
and
a
sense
that
somehow
time
had
come
to
a
sudden
unexpected
screecthalt
he
snagged
his
hands
in
tough
matted
hair
the
pelt
he
thought
i've
got
its
pelt
and
he
could
feel
the
heavy
bone
of
its
skull
beneath
thrust
at
that
wolvish
head
with
all
of
his
force
but
although
he
was
a
big
boy
it
did
no
good
at
all
if
he
had
not
stumbled
back
and
struck
the
wall
the
thing
would
have
torn
his
throat
open
with
its
teeth
it
came
after
him
its
greenishyellow
eyes
flaring
it
growled
with
each
breath
it
smelled
of
the
sewer
and
something
else
some
wild
yet
unpleasant
odor
like
rotten
hazelnuts
one
of
its
heavy
paws
rose
and
ben
skittered
aside
as
best
he
could
the
paw
tipped
with
heavy
claws
ripped
bloodless
wounds
through
the
wallpaper
and
into
the
cheesy
plaster
beneath
he
could
dimly
hear
richie
bellowing
something
eddie
howling
at
beverly
to
shoot
it
shoot
it
but
beverly
did
not
this
was
her
only
other
chance
it
didn't
matter
she
intended
that
it
be
the
only
one
she
would
need
a
clear
coldness
she
never
saw
again
in
her
life
fell
over
her
sight
in
it
everything
stood
out
and
forward
never
again
would
she
see
the
three
dimensions
of
reality
so
clearly
denned
she
possessed
every
color
every
angle
every
distance
fear
departed
she
felt
the
hunter
simple
lust
of
certainty
and
oncoming
consummation
her
pulse
slowed
the
hysterical
trembling
grip
in
which
she
had
been
holding
the
bullseye
loosened
then
firmed
and
became
natural
she
drew
in
a
deep
breath
it
seemed
to
her
that
her
lungs
would
never
fill
completely
dimly
faintly
she
heard
popping
sounds
didn't
matter
whatever
they
were
she
tracked
left
waiting
for
the
werewolfs
improbable
head
to
fall
with
cool
perfection
into
the
wishbone
beyond
the
extended
v
of
the
drawn
back
sling
the
werewolfs
claws
descended
again
ben
tried
to
duck
under
them
but
suddenly
he
was
in
its
grip
it
jerked
him
forward
as
if
he
had
been
no
more
than
a
ragdoll
its
jaws
snapped
open
bastard
he
thrust
a
thumb
into
one
of
its
eyes
it
bellowed
with
pain
and
one
of
those
clawtipped
paws
ripped
through
his
shirt
ben
sucked
his
stomach
in
but
one
of
the
claws
pulled
a
sizzling
line
of
pain
down
his
chest
and
stomach
blood
gushed
out
of
him
and
splattered
on
his
pants
his
sneakers
the
floor
the
werewolf
threw
him
into
the
bathtub
he
thumped
his
head
saw
stars
struggled
into
a
sitting
position
and
saw
his
lap
was
full
of
blood
the
werewolf
whirled
around
ben
observed
with
that
same
lunatic
clarity
that
it
was
wearing
faded
levi
strauss
bluejeans
the
seams
had
split
open
a
snotcaked
red
bandanna
the
sort
a
trainman
might
carry
hung
from
one
back
pocket
written
on
the
back
of
its
silver
and
orange
high
school
jacket
were
the
words
derry
high
school
killing
team
below
this
the
name
pennywise
and
in
the
center
a
number
it
went
for
bill
again
he
had
gotten
to
his
feet
and
now
stood
with
his
back
to
the
wall
looking
at
it
steadily
shoot
it
beverly
richie
screamed
again
beepbeep
richie
she
heard
herself
reply
from
roughly
a
thousand
miles
away
the
werewolf
head
was
suddenly
there
in
the
wishbone
she
covered
one
of
its
green
eyes
with
the
cup
and
released
there
was
no
shake
in
either
d
her
hands
she
fired
as
smoothly
and
naturally
as
she
had
fired
at
the
cans
in
the
dump
on
the
day
they
had
all
taken
turns
to
see
who
was
the
best
there
was
time
for
ben
to
think
oh
beverly
if
you
miss
this
time
we're
all
dead
and
i
don't
want
to
die
in
this
dirty
bathtub
but
i
can't
get
out
there
was
no
miss
a
round
eye
not
green
but
dead
black
suddenly
appeared
high
up
in
the
center
of
its
snout
she
had
aimed
for
the
right
eye
and
missed
by
less
than
half
an
inch
its
scream
an
almost
human
scream
of
surprise
pain
fear
and
rage
was
deafening
ben
ears
rang
with
it
then
the
perfect
round
hole
in
its
snout
was
gone
obscured
by
freshets
of
blood
it
was
not
flowing
it
gouted
from
the
wound
in
a
highpressure
torrent
the
freshet
drenched
bill
face
and
hair
doesn't
matter
ben
thought
hysterically
don't
worry
bill
nobody
will
be
able
to
see
it
anyway
when
we
get
out
of
here
if
we
ever
do
bill
and
beverly
advanced
on
the
werewolf
and
behind
them
richie
cried
out
hysterically
shoot
it
again
beverly
kill
it
kill
it
mike
screamed
that
right
kill
it
eddie
chimed
in
kill
it
bill
cried
his
mouth
drawn
down
in
a
quivering
bow
there
was
a
whitishyellow
streak
of
plaster
dust
in
his
hair
kill
it
beverly
don't
let
it
get
away”
no
ammo
left
ben
thought
incoherently
we're
slugged
out
what
are
you
talking
about
kill
it
but
he
looked
at
beverly
and
understood
if
his
heart
had
never
been
hers
before
that
moment
it
would
have
flown
to
her
then
she
had
pulled
the
sling
back
again
her
fingers
were
closed
over
the
cup
hiding
its
emptiness
kill
it
ben
screamed
and
flopped
clumsily
over
the
edge
of
the
tub
his
jeans
and
underwear
were
soaked
against
his
skin
with
blood
he
had
no
idea
if
he
was
hurt
badly
or
not
following
the
original
hot
sizzle
there
hadn't
been
much
pain
but
there
sure
was
an
awful
lot
of
blood
the
werewolf
greenish
eyes
flickered
among
them
now
filled
with
uncertainty
as
well
as
pain
blood
poured
down
the
front
of
its
jacket
in
freshets
bill
denbrough
smiled
it
was
a
gentle
rather
lovely
smile
but
it
did
not
touch
his
eyes
you
shouldn't
have
started
with
my
brother
he
said
send
the
fucker
to
hell
beverly
the
uncertainty
left
the
creature
eyes
it
believed
with
lithe
smooth
grace
it
turned
and
dove
into
the
drain
as
it
went
it
changed
the
derry
high
jacket
melted
into
its
pelt
and
the
color
ran
out
of
both
the
shape
of
its
skull
elongated
as
if
it
had
been
made
of
wax
which
was
now
softening
and
beginning
to
run
its
shape
changed
for
one
instant
ben
believed
he
had
nearly
seen
what
shape
it
really
was
and
his
heart
froze
inside
his
chest
leaving
him
gasping
tu
kill
you
all
a
voice
roared
from
inside
the
drainpipe
it
was
thick
savage
not
in
the
least
human
kill
you
all
kill
you
all
kill
you
all
the
words
faded
back
and
back
diminishing
washing
out
growing
distant
at
last
joining
the
low
throbbing
hum
of
the
pumping
machinery
floating
through
the
pipes
the
house
seemed
to
settle
with
a
heavy
subaudible
thud
but
it
wasn't
settling
ben
realized
in
some
strange
way
it
was
shrinking
coming
back
to
its
normal
size
whatever
magic
it
had
used
to
make
the
house
at
neibolt
street
seem
bigger
was
now
withdrawn
the
house
snapped
back
like
an
elastic
it
was
only
a
house
now
smelling
damp
and
a
little
rotten
an
unfurnished
house
where
winos
and
hobos
sometimes
came
to
drink
and
talk
and
sleep
out
of
the
rain
it
was
gone
in
its
wake
the
silence
seemed
very
loud
wwwe
guhgot
to
¢gget
owowout
of
this
pplace
bill
said
he
walked
over
to
where
ben
was
trying
to
get
up
and
grabbed
one
of
his
outstretched
hands
beverly
was
standing
near
the
drain
she
looked
down
at
herself
and
that
coldness
disappeared
in
a
flush
that
seemed
to
turn
all
her
skin
into
one
warm
stocking
it
must
have
been
a
deep
breath
indeed
the
dim
popping
sounds
had
been
the
buttons
on
her
blouse
they
were
gone
every
single
one
of
them
the
blouse
hung
open
and
her
small
breasts
were
clearly
revealed
she
snatched
the
blouse
closed
ruhruh
richie
bill
said
help
me
with
bbben
he
hhh
richie
joined
him
then
stan
and
mike
the
four
of
them
got
ben
to
his
feet
eddie
had
gone
to
beverly
and
put
his
good
arm
awkwardly
around
her
shoulders
you
did
great
he
said
and
beverly
burst
into
tears
ben
took
two
big
staggering
steps
to
the
wall
and
leaned
against
it
before
he
could
fall
over
again
his
head
felt
light
color
kept
washing
in
and
out
of
the
world
he
felt
decidedly
pukey
then
bill
arm
was
around
him
strong
and
comforting
how
bbbad
ih
ihis
it
haystack
ben
forced
himself
to
look
down
at
his
stomach
he
found
performing
two
smple
actions
bending
his
neck
and
spreading
apart
the
slit
in
his
shirt
took
more
courage
than
he
had
needed
to
enter
the
house
in
the
first
place
he
expected
to
see
half
his
insides
hanging
down
in
front
of
him
like
grotesque
udders
instead
he
saw
that
the
flow
of
blood
had
slowed
to
a
sluggish
trickle
the
werewolf
had
slashed
him
long
and
deep
but
apparently
not
mortally
richie
joined
them
he
looked
at
the
cut
which
ran
a
twisting
course
down
ben
chest
and
petered
out
on
the
upper
bulge
df
his
stomach
then
soberly
into
ben
face
it
just
about
had
your
guts
for
suspenders
haystack
you
know
it
no
fake
jake
ben
said
he
and
richie
stared
at
each
other
for
a
long
considering
moment
and
then
they
broke
into
hysterical
giggles
at
the
same
instant
spraying
each
other
with
spittle
richie
took
ben
into
his
arms
and
pounded
his
back
we
beat
it
haystack
we
beat
i
wwwe
dihdihdihdidn't

bill
said
grimly
we
got
hlucky

to

back
wher
mike
asked

bub
barrens
bill
said
beverly
made
her
way
over
to
them
still
holding
her
blouse
closed
her
cheeks
were
bright
red
the
clubhouse
bill
nodded
can
i
have
someone
shirt
beverly
asked
blushing
more
furiously
than
ever
bill
glanced
down
at
her
and
the
blood
came
into
his
own
face
all
in
a
rush
he
turned
his
eyes
away
hastily
but
in
that
instant
ben
felt
a
rush
of
knowledge
and
dismal
momentary
jealousy
in
that
instant
that
one
bare
second
bill
had
become
aware
of
her
in
a
way
that
only
ben
had
himself
been
before
the
others
had
also
looked
and
then
looked
away
richie
coughed
against
the
back
of
his
hand
stan
turned
red
and
mike
hanlon
dropped
back
a
step
or
two
as
if
actually
frightened
by
the
sideswell
of
that
one
small
white
breast
visible
below
her
hand
beverly
threw
her
head
up
shaking
her
tangled
hair
back
behind
her
she
was
still
blushing
but
her
face
was
lovely
can't
help
it
that
i'm
a
girl
she
said
or
that
i'm
starting
to
get
big
on
top
now
can't
i
please
have
someone
shirt
shshsure
bill
said
he
pulled
his
white
tshirt
over
his
head
baring
his
narrow
chest
the
visible
rack
of
his
ribs
his
sunburned
freckled
shoulders
here
thank
you
bill
she
said
and
for
one
hot
smoking
moment
their
eyes
locked
directly
bill
did
not
look
away
this
time
his
gaze
was
firm
adult
wwwwelcom
he
said
good
luck
big
bill
ben
thought
and
he
turned
away
from
that
gaze
it
was
hurting
him
hurting
him
in
a
deeper
place
than
any
vampire
or
werewolf
would
ever
be
able
to
reach
but
all
the
same
there
was
such
a
thing
as
propriety
the
word
he
didn't
know
on
the
concept
he
was
very
clear
looking
at
them
when
they
were
looking
at
each
other
that
way
would
be
as
wrong
as
looking
at
her
breasts
when
she
let
go
of
the
front
of
her
blouse
to
pull
bill
shirt
over
her
head
zf
that
the
way
it
is
but
you'll
never
love
her
the
way
i
do
never
bill
tshirt
came
down
almost
to
her
knees
if
not
for
the
jeans
poking
out
from
beneath
its
hem
she
would
have
looked
as
if
she
was
wearing
a
slip
lllet
guhguh
go
bill
repeated
i
duhdon't
nunknow
about
you
gguys
but
i've
hhad
eeeeenough
for
wuhwuhone
dday
turned
out
they
all
had
the
passage
of
an
hour
found
them
in
the
clubhouse
both
the
window
and
the
trapdoor
open
it
was
cool
inside
and
the
barrens
were
blessedly
silent
that
day
they
sat
without
talking
much
each
lost
in
his
or
her
own
thoughts
richie
and
bev
passed
a
marlboro
back
and
forth
eddie
took
a
brief
snort
from
his
aspirator
mike
sneezed
several
times
and
apologized
he
said
he
was
catching
a
cold
thass
the
oney
theeng
you
could
catch
senhorr
richie
said
companionably
enough
and
that
was
all
ben
kept
expecting
the
mad
interlude
in
the
house
on
neibolt
street
to
take
on
the
hues
of
a
dream
it'll
recede
and
fall
apart
he
thought
the
way
that
bad
dreams
do
you
wake
up
gasping
and
sweating
all
over
but
fifteen
minutes
later
you
can't
remember
what
the
dream
was
even
about
but
that
didn't
happen
everything
that
had
happened
from
the
time
he
had
forced
his
way
in
through
the
cellar
window
to
the
moment
bill
had
used
he
chair
in
the
kitchen
to
break
a
window
so
they
could
get
out
remained
bright
and
clearly
fixed
in
his
memory
it
had
not
been
a
dream
the
clotted
wound
on
his
chest
and
belly
was
not
a
dream
and
it
didn't
matter
if
his
mom
could
see
it
or
not
at
last
beverly
stood
up
i
have
to
go
home
she
said
i
want
to
change
before
my
mom
gets
home
if
she
sees
me
wearing
a
boy
shirt
she'll
kill
me
keel
you
senhorrit
richie
agreed
but
she
will
keel
you
slow
beep
beep
richie
bill
was
looking
at
her
gravely
ti
return
your
shirt
bill
he
nodded
and
waved
a
hand
to
show
that
this
wasn't
important
will
you
get
in
trouble
coming
home
without
it
nno
they
hhhardly
nuhhotice
when
i'm
aa
around
anyway
she
nodded
bit
her
full
underlip
a
girl
of
eleven
who
was
tall
for
her
age
and
simply
beautiful
what
happens
next
bill
i
dddon't
nuhnuh
know
it
not
over
is
it
bill
shook
his
head
ben
said
it'll
want
us
more
than
ever
now
more
silver
slugs
she
asked
him
he
found
he
could
barely
stand
to
meet
her
glance
i
love
you
beverly
just
let
me
have
that
you
can
have
bill
or
the
world
or
whatever
you
need
just
let
me
have
that
let
me
go
on
loving
you
and
i
guess
it'll
be
enough
i
don't
know
ben
said
we
could
but
he
trailed
off
vaguely
shrugged
he
could
not
say
what
he
felt
was
somehow
not
able
to
bring
it
out
that
this
was
like
being
in
a
monster
movie
but
it
wasn't
the
mummy
had
looked
different
in
some
ways
ways
that
confirmed
its
essential
reality
the
same
was
true
of
the
werewolf
he
could
testify
to
that
because
he
had
seen
it
in
a
paralyzing
closeup
no
film
not
even
one
in
d
allowed
he
had
had
his
hands
in
the
wiry
underbrush
of
its
tangled
pelt
he
had
seen
a
small
balefulorange
firespot
like
a
pompom
in
one
of
its
green
eyes
these
things
were
well
they
were
dreams
madereal
and
once
dreams
became
real
they
escaped
the
power
of
the
dreamer
and
became
their
own
deadly
things
capable
of
independent
action
the
silver
slugs
had
worked
because
the
seven
of
them
had
been
unified
in
their
belief
that
they
would
but
they
hadn't
killed
it
and
next
time
it
would
approach
them
in
a
new
shape
one
over
which
silver
wielded
no
power
power
power
ben
thought
looking
at
beverly
it
was
okay
now
her
eyes
had
met
bill
again
and
they
were
looking
at
each
other
as
if
lost
it
was
only
for
a
moment
but
to
ben
it
seemed
very
long
it
always
comes
back
to
power
i
love
beverly
marsh
and
she
has
power
over
me
she
loves
bill
denbrough
and
so
he
has
power
over
her
but
i
think
he
is
coming
to
love
her
maybe
it
was
her
face
how
it
looked
when
she
said
she
couldn't
help
being
a
girl
maybe
it
was
seeing
one
breast
for
just
a
second
maybe
just
the
way
she
looks
sometimes
when
the
light
is
right
or
her
eyes
doesn't
matter
but
if
he
starting
to
love
her
she
starting
to
have
power
over
him
superman
has
power
except
when
there
kryptonite
around
batman
has
power
even
though
he
can't
fly
or
see
through
walls
my
mom
has
power
over
me
and
her
boss
down
in
the
mill
has
power
over
her
everyone
has
some
except
maybe
for
link
kids
and
babies
then
he
thought
that
even
little
kds
and
babies
had
power
they
could
cry
until
you
had
to
do
something
to
shut
them
up
ben
beverly
asked
looking
back
at
him
cat
got
your
tongue
huh
no
i
was
thinking
about
power
the
power
of
the
slugs
bill
was
looking
at
him
closely
i
was
wondering
where
that
power
came
from
ben
said
thih
it
bill
began
and
then
shut
his
mouth
a
thoughtful
vague
expression
drifted
over
his
face
i
really
have
to
go
beverly
said
t'll
see
you
all
huh
sure
come
on
down
tomorrow
stan
said
we're
going
to
break
eddie
other
arm
they
all
laughed
eddie
pretended
to
throw
his
aspirator
at
stan
bye
then
beverly
said
and
boosted
herself
up
and
out
ben
looked
at
bill
and
saw
that
he
hadn't
joined
in
the
laughter
that
thoughtful
expression
was
still
on
his
face
and
ben
knew
you
would
have
to
call
his
name
two
or
three
times
before
he
would
answer
he
knew
what
bill
was
thinking
about
he
would
be
thinking
about
it
himself
in
the
days
ahead
not
all
the
time
no
there
would
be
clothes
to
hang
out
and
take
in
for
his
mother
games
of
tag
and
guns
in
the
barrens
and
during
a
rainy
spell
the
first
four
days
of
august
the
seven
of
them
would
go
on
a
mad
parcheesi
jag
at
richie
tozier
house
making
blockades
sending
each
other
back
with
great
abandon
deliberating
exactly
how
to
split
the
roll
of
the
dice
while
rain
dripped
and
ran
outside
his
mother
would
announce
to
him
that
she
believed
pat
nixon
was
the
prettiest
woman
in
america
and
be
horrorstruck
when
ben
opted
for
marilyn
monroe
except
for
the
color
of
her
hair
he
thought
that
bev
looked
like
marilyn
monroe
there
would
be
time
to
eat
as
many
twinkies
and
ringdings
and
devil
dogs
as
he
could
get
his
hands
on
and
time
to
sit
on
the
back
porch
reading
lucky
starr
and
the
moons
of
mercury
there
would
be
time
for
all
of
those
things
while
the
wound
on
his
chest
and
belly
healed
to
a
scab
and
began
to
itch
because
life
went
on
and
at
eleven
although
bright
and
apt
he
held
no
real
sense
of
perspective
he
could
live
with
what
had
happened
in
the
house
on
neibolt
street
the
world
was
after
all
full
of
wonders
but
there
would
be
odd
moments
of
time
when
he
pulled
the
questions
out
again
and
examined
them
the
power
of
the
silver
the
power
of
the
slugs
where
does
power
like
that
come
from
where
does
any
power
come
from
how
do
you
get
it
how
do
you
use
it
it
seemed
to
him
that
their
lives
might
depend
on
those
questions
one
night
as
he
was
falling
asleep
the
rain
a
steady
lulling
patter
on
the
roof
and
against
the
windows
it
occurred
to
him
that
there
was
another
question
perhaps
the
only
question
it
had
some
real
shape
he
had
nearly
seen
it
to
see
the
shape
was
to
see
the
secret
was
that
also
true
of
power
perhaps
it
was
for
wasn't
it
true
that
power
like
it
was
a
shapechanger
it
was
a
baby
crying
in
the
middle
of
the
night
it
was
an
atomic
bomb
it
was
a
silver
slug
it
was
the
way
beverly
looked
at
bill
and
the
way
bill
looked
back
what
exactly
what
was
power
anyway
nothing
much
happened
for
the
next
two
weeks
derry
the
fourth
interlude
you
got
to
lose
you
can't
win
all
the
time
you
got
to
lose
you
can't
win

the
time

here
he
sits
one
drunk
nigger
in
a
public
library
after
closing
with
this
book

in
front
of
me
and
the
bottle
of
old
kentucky

my
left

bitter
old
fuck
even
believed
it
full
of
rum
or
rye
you
can
believe
anything
drink
and
the
devil
okay
amuses
me
sometimes
to
think
how
long
i'd
last
if
i
actually
published
some
of
this
stuff
i
write
in
the
dead
of
night
if
i
flashed
some
of
the
skeletons
in
derry
closet
there
is
a
library
board
of
directors
eleven
of
them
one
is
a
seventyyearold
writer
who
suffered
a
stroke
two
years
ago
and
who
now
often
needs
help
to
find
his
place
on
each
meeting
printed
agenda
and
who
has
sometimes
been
observed
picking
large
dry
boogers
out
of
his
hairy
nostrils
and
placing
them
carefully
in
his
ear
as
if
for
safekeeping
another
is
a
pushy
woman
who
came
here
from
new
york
with
her
doctor
husband
and
who
talks
in
a
constant
whiny
monologue
about
how
provincial
derry
is
how
no
one
here
understands
the
jewish
experience
and
how
one
has
to
go
to
boston
to
buy
a
skirt
one
would
care
to
be
seen
in
last
time
this
anorexic
babe
spoke
to
me
without
the
services
of
an
intermediary
was
during
the
board
christmas
party
about
a
year
and
a
half
ago
she
had
consumed
a
pretty
large
amount
of
gin
and
asked
me
if
anyone
in
derry
understood
the
black
experience
i
had
also
consumed
a
pretty
large
amount
of
gin
and
answered
mrs
gladry
jews
may
be
a
great
mystery
but
niggers
are
understood
the
whole
world
round
she
choked
on
her
drink
whirled
around
so
sharply
that
her
panties
were
momentarily
visible
under
her
flaring
skirt
not
a
very
interesting
view
would
that
it
had
been
carol
danner
and
so
ended
my
last
informal
conversation
with
mrs
ruth
gladry
no
great
loss
the
other
members
of
the
board
are
the
descendants
of
the
lumber
barons
their
support
of
the
library
is
an
act
of
inherited
expiation
they
raped
the
woods
and
now
care
for
these
books
the
way
a
libertine
might
decide
in
his
middle
age
to
provide
for
the
gaily
gotten
bastards
of
his
youth
it
was
their
grandfathers
and
great
grandfathers
who
actually
spread
the
legs
of
the
forests
north
of
derry
and
bangor
and
raped
those
green
gowned
virgins
with
their
axes
and
peaveys
they
cut
and
slashed
and
striptimbered
and
never
looked
back
they
tore
the
hymen
of
those
great
forests
open
when
grover
cleveland
was
president
and
had
pretty
well
finished
the
job
by
the
time
woodrow
wilson
had
his
stroke
these
laceruffled
ruffians
raped
the
great
woods
impregnated
them
with
a
litter
of
slash
and
junk
spruce
and
changed
derry
from
a
sleepy
litte
shipbuilding
town
into
a
booming
honkytonk
where
the
ginmills
never
closed
and
the
whores
turned
tricks
all
night
long
one
old
campaigner
egbert
thoroughgood
now
ninetythree
told
me
of
taking
a
slatthin
prostitute
in
a
crib
on
baker
street
a
street
which
no
longer
exists
middleclass
apartment
housing
stands
quietly
where
baker
street
once
boiled
and
brawled
only
realized
after
i
spent
m'spunk
in
her
that
she
was
laying
in
a
pool
of
jizzum
maybe
an
inch
deep
stuff
had
just
about
gone
to
jelly
girl
i
says
ain't
you
never
cared
for
y'self
she
looks
down
and
says
i'll
put
on
a
new
sheet
if

by

my

it

be

that
was

right
through
the
first
twenty
or
so
years
of
the
twentieth
century
all
boom
and
booze
and
balling
the
penobscot
and
the
kenduskeag
were
full
of
floating
logs
from
iceout
in

to

in

the

began
to
slacken
off
in
the
twenties
without
the
great
war
or
the
hardwoods
to
feed
it
and
it
staggered
to
a
stop
during
the
depression
the
lumber
barons
put
their
money
in
those
new
york
or
boston
banks
that
had
survived
the
crash
and
left
derry
economy
to
live

on

own
they
retreated
to
their
gracious
houses
on
west
broadway
and
sent
their
children
to
private
schools
in
new
hampshire
massachusetts
and
new

and
lived
on
their
interest
and
political
connections
what
left
of

seventysome
years
after

anything
about

of
the

or
the
affair
of
claude
heroux
and
the
silver

the
silver
dollar
was
a
beerjoint
and
what
may
have
been
the
queerest
mass
murder
in
the
entire
history
of
america
took
place
there
in
september
of
there
are
still
a
few
old
timers
in
derry
who
claim
to
remember
it
but
the
only
account
that
i
really
trust
is
thoroughgood
he
was
eighteen
when
it
happened
thoroughgood
now
lives
in
the
paulson
nursing
home
he
toothless
and
his
st
john
valley
franco/downcast
accent
is
so
thick
that
probably
only
another
old
mainer
could
understand
what
he
was
saying
if
his
talk
were
written
down
phonetically
sandy
ives
the
folklorist
from
the
university
of
maine
whom
i
have
mentioned
previously
in
these
wild
pages
helped
me
to
translate
my
audio
tapes
claude
heroux
was
according
to
thoroughgood
un
bat
canuck
sonofawhore
widdin
eye
that'd
roll
adju
like
a
mart
in
dem
oonlight
translation
one
bad
canuck
son
of
a
whore
with
an
eye
that
would
roll
at
you
like
a
mare
in
the
moonlight.’
thoroughgood
said
that
he
and
everyone
else
who
had
worked
with
heroux
believed
the
man
was
as
sly
as
a
chickenstealing
dog
which
made
his
hatchetwielding
foray
into
the
silver
dollar
all
the
more
startling
it
was
not
in
character
up
until
then
lumbermen
in
derry
had
believed
heroux
talents
ran
more
to
lighting
fires
in
the
woods
the
summer
of
was
long
and
hot
and
there
had
been
many
fires
in
the
woods
the
biggest
of
them
which
heroux
later
admitted
he
set
by
simply
putting
a
lighted
candle
in
the
middle
of
a
pile
of
woodchips
and
kindling
happened
in
haven
big
injun
woods
it
burned
twenty
thousand
acres
of
prune
hardwood
and
you
could
smell
the
smoke
of
it
thirtyfive
miles
away
as
the
horsedrawn
trollies
breasted
up
mile
hill
in
derry
in
the
spring
of
that
year
there
had
been
some
brief
talk
about
unionizing
there
were
four
lumbermen
involved
in
organizing
not
that
there
was
much
to
organize
maine
workingmen
were
antiunion
then
and
are
for
the
large
part
antiunion
now
and
one
of
the
four
was
claude
heroux
who
probably
saw
his
union
activities
mostly
as
a
chance
to
talk
big
and
spend
a
lot
of
time
drinking
down
on
baker
and
exchange
streets
heroux
and
the
other
three
called
themselves
organizer
the
lumber
barons
called
them
ringleaders
a
proclamation
nailed
to
the
cooksheds
in
lumber
camps
from
monroe
to
haven
village
to
sumner
plantation
to
millinocket
informed
lumbermen
that
any
man
overheard
talking
union
would
be
fired
off
the
job
immediately
in
may
of
that
year
there
was
a
brief
strike
up
near
trapham
notch
and
although
the
strike
was
broken
in
short
order
both
by
scabs
and
by
town
constables
and
that
was
rather
peculiar
you
understand
since
there
were
nearly
thirty
town
constable
swinging
axe
handles
and
creasing
skulls
but
before
that
day
in
may
there
hadn't
been
so
much
as
a
single
constable
in
trapham
notch
which
had
a
population
of
in
the
census
of
so
far
as
anyone
knew
heroux
and
his
organizing
friends
considered
it
a
great
victory
for
their
cause
accordingly
they
came
down
to
derry
to
get
drunk
and
to
do
some
more
organizing
or
tingleading
depending
on
whose
side
you
favored
whichever
it
must
have
been
dry
work
they
hit
most
of
the

any

looking

might
well
have
been
excused
for
turning
away
according
to
egbert
thoroughgood
the
only
reason
anyone
could
figure
for
heroux
being
in
the
movement
at
all
was
davey
hartwell
hartwell
was
the
chief
organizer
or
ringleader
and
heroux
was
in
love
with
him
nor
was
he
the
only
one
most
of
the
men
in
the
movement
loved
hartwell
deeply
and
passionately
with
that
proud
love

of

trying

for

heroux
was
sly
and
he
was
mean
and
i
suppose
that
in
a
novel
that
would
preclude
any
good
qualities
at
all

sometimes
when
a

lives

that
the
way
it
appeared
to
have
been
between
heroux
and
hartwell
anyway
there
were
four
of
them
who
spent
that
night
in
the
brentwood
arms
hotel
which
was
then
called
the
floating
dog
by
the
lumbermen
the
reason
why
is
lost
in
obscurity
not
even
egbert
thoroughgood
remembers
four
checked

checked

one
of
them
andy
delesseps
was
never
seen
again
for
all
history
tells
he
might
have
spent
the
rest
of
his
life
living
in
pleasant
ease
in
portsmouth
but
somehow
i
doubt
it
two
of
the
other
ringleaders
amsel
bickford
and
davey
hartwell
himself
were
found
floating
face
down
in
the
kenduskeag
bickford
was
missing
his
head
someone
had
taken
it
off
with
the
swipe
of
a
woodsman
twohander
both
of
hartwell
legs
were
gone
and
those
who
found
him
swore
that
they
had
never
seen
such
an
expression
of
pain
and
horror
on
a
human
face
something
had
distended
his
mouth
stuffing
out
his
cheeks
and
when
his
discoverers
turned
him
over
and
spread
his
lips
seven
of
his
toes
fell
out
onto
the
mud
some
thought
he
might
have
lost
the
other
three
during
his
years
working
in
the
woods
others
hell
the
opinion
that
he
might
have
swallowed
them
before
he
died
pinned
to
the
back
of
each
man
shirt
was
a
paper
with
the
word
union
on
it
claude
heroux
was
never
brought
to
trial
for
what
happened
in
the
silver
dollar
on
the
night
of
september
th
so
there
no
way
of
knowing
exactly
how
he
escaped
the
fate
of
the
others
that
night
in
may
we
could
make
assumptions
he
had
been
on
his
own
a
long
time
had
learned
how
to
jump
fast
had
perhaps
developed
the
knack
some
curdogs
have
of
getting
out
just
before
real
trouble
develops
but
why
didn't
he
take
hartwell
with
him
or
was
he
perhaps
taken
into
the
woods
with
the
rest
of
the
agitators
maybe
they
were
saving
him
for
last
and
he
was
able
to
get
away
even
while
hartwell
screams
which
would
have
grown
muffled
as
they
jammed
his
toes
into
his
mouth
were
echoing
in
the
dark
and
scaring
birds
off
their
roosts
there
no
way
of
knowing
not
for
sure
but
that
last
feels
right
to
my
heart
claude
heroux
became
a
ghostman
he
would
come
strolling
into
a
camp
in
the
st
john
valley
line
up
at
the
cookshed
with
the
rest
of
the
loggers
get
a
bowl
of
stew
eat
it
and
be
gone
before
anyone
realized
he
wasn't
one
of
the
topping
gang
weeks
after
that
he'd
show
up
in
a
winterport
beerjoint
talking
union
and
swearing
he'd
have
his
revenge
on
the
men
that
had
murdered
his
friends
hamilton
tracker
william
mueller
and
richard
bowie
were
the
names
he
mentioned
the
most
frequently
all
of
them
lived
in
derry
and
their
gabled
gambrelled
cupolaed
houses
stand
on
west
broadway
to
this
day
years
later
they
and
their
descendants
would
fire
the
black
spot
that
there
were
people
who
would
have
liked
claude
heroux
put
out
of
the
way
cannot
be
doubted
particularly
after
the
fires
started
in
june
of
that
year
but
although
heroux
was
seen
frequently
he
was
quick
and
had
an
animal
awareness
of
danger
so
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
find
out
no
official
warrant
was
ever
sworn
out
against
him
and
the
police
never
took
a
hand
maybe
there
were
fears
about
what
heroux
might
say
if
he
was
brought
to
trial
for
arson
whatever
the
reasons
the
woods
around
derry
and
haven
burned
all
that
hot
summer
children
disappeared
there
were
more
fights
and
murders
than
usual
and
a
pall
of
fear
as
real
as
the
smoke
you
could
smell
from
the
top
of
upmile
hill
lay
over
the
town
the
rains
finally
came
on
september
first
and
it
rained
for
a
solid
week
downtown
derry
was
flooded
out
which
was
not
unusual
but
the
big
houses
on
west
broadway
were
high
above
downtown
and
in
some
of
those
big
houses
there
must
have
been
sighs
of
relief
let
the
crazy
canuck
hide
out
in
the
woods
all
whiter
if
that
what
he
wants
they
might
have
said
his
work
done
for
this
summer
and
we'll
get
him
before
the
roots
dry
next
june
then
came
september
th
i
cannot
explain
what
happened
thoroughgood
cannot
explain
it
so
far
as
i
know
no
one
can
i
can
only
relate
the
events
which
occurred
the
sleepy
silver
dollar
was
full
of
loggers
drinking
beer
outside
it
was
drawing
down
toward
misty
dark
the
kenduskeag
was
high
and
silversullen
filling
its
channel
from
bank
to
bank
and
according
to
egbert
thoroughgood
a
fallish
wind
was
blowin
the
kine
dat
alms
fine
de
hole
in
y'paints
and
blow
strayduppa
cracka
yo
ais
the
streets
were
quagmires
there
was
a
card
game
going
on
at
one
of
the
tables
in
the
back
of
the
room
they
were
william
mueller
men
mueller
was
part
owner
of
the
gs&ampwm
rail
line
as
well
as
a
lumber
potentate
who
owned
millions
of
acres
of
prime
timber
and
the
men
who
were
playing
poker
around
an
oilclothcovered
table
in
the
dollar
that
night
were
parttime
lumbermen
parttime
railroad
bulls
and
full
time
trouble
two
of
them
tinker
mccutcheon
and
floyd
calderwood
had
done
jailtime
with
them
were
lathrop
rounds
his
nickname
as
obscure
as
the
floating
dog
hotel
was
el
katook
david
stugle
grenier
and
eddie
king
a
bearded
man
whose
spectacles
were
almost
as
fat
as
his
gut
it
seems
very
likely
that
they
were
at
least
some
of
the
men
who
had
spent
the
last
two
and
a
half
months
keeping
an
eye
out
for
claude
heroux
it
seems
just
as
likely
although
there
is
not
a
shred
of
proof
that
they
were
in
on
the
little
cutting
party
in
may
when
hartwell
and
bickford
were
laid
low
the
bar
was
crowded
thoroughgood
said
dozens
of
men
were
bellied
up
there
drinking
beer
and
eating
bar
lunches
and
dripping
onto
the
sawdustcovered
dirt
floor
the
door
opened
and
in
came
claude
heroux
he
had
a
woodsman
doublebitted
axe
in
his
hand
he
stepped
up
to
the
bar
and
elbowed
himself
a
place
egbert
thoroughgood
was
standing
on
his
left
he
said
that
heroux
smelled
like
a
polecat
stew
the
barman
brought
heroux
a
schooner
of
beer
two
hardcooked
eggs
in
a
bowl
and
a
shaker
of
salt
heroux
paid
him
with
a
twodollar
bill
and
put
his
change
a
dollar
eightyfive
into
one
of
the
flap
pockets
of
his
lumberman
jacket
he
salted
his
eggs
and
ate
them
he
salted
his
beer
drank
it
off
and
uttered
a
belch
more
room
out
than
here
is
in
claude
thoroughgood
said
just
as
if
half
the
enforcers
in
northern
maine
hadn't
been
on
the
prod
for
heroux
all
that
summer
you
know
that
the
truth
heroux
said
except
being
a
canuck
what
he
probably
said
came
out
sounding
more
ike
you
know
dot
da
troot
he
ordered
himself
another
schooner
drank
up
and
belched
again
talk
at
the
bar
went
on
there
was
no
silence
like
the
ones
in
the
western
movies
when
the
good
guy
or
the
bad
guy
pushes
his
way
through
the
batwings
and
makes
his
ominous
way
to
the
bar
several
people
called
to
him
claude
nodded
and
waved
but
he
didn't
smile
thoroughgood
said
he
looked
like
a
man
who
was
half
in
a
dream
at
the
table
in
back
the
poker
game
went
on
el
katook
was
dealing
no
one
bothered
to
tell
any
of
the
players
that
claude
heroux
was
in
the
bar
although
since
their
table
was
no
more
than
twenty
feet
away
and
since
claude
name
was
hollered
more
than
once
by
people
who
knew
him
it
is
hard
to
know
how
they
could
have
gone
on
playing
unaware
of
his
potentially
murderous
presence
but
that
is
what
occurred
after
he
finished
his
second
schooner
of
beer
heroux
excused
himself
to
thoroughgood
picked
up
his
twohander
and
went
back
to
the
table
where
mueller
men
were
playing
five
card
stud
then
he
started
cutting
floyd
calderwood
had
just
poured
himself
a
glass
of
rye
whiskey
and
was
setting
the
bottle
back
down
when
heroux
arrived
and
chopped
calderwood
hand
off
at
the
wrist
calderwood
looked
at
his
hand
and
screamed
it
was
still
holding
the
bottle
but
all
of
a
sudden
wasn't
attached
to
anything
but
wet
gristle
and
trailing
veins
for
a
moment
the
severed
hand
clutched
the
bottle
even
tighter
and
then
it
fell
off
and
lay
on
the
table
like
a
dead
spider
blood
spouted
from
his
wrist
at
the
bar
somebody
called
for
more
beer
and
someone
else
asked
the
bartender
whose
name
was
jonesy
if
he
was
still
dying
his
hair
never
dyed
it
jonesy
said
in
an
illtempered
way
he
was
vain
of
his
hair
met
a
whore
down
at
ma
courtney
who
said
what
grows
around
your
pecker
is
just
as
white
as
snow
the
fellow
said
she
was
a
liar
jonesy
replied
drop
your
pants
and
let
us
see
said
a
lumberman
named
falkland
with
whom
egbert
thoroughgood
had
been
matching
for
drinks
before
heroux
came
in
this
provoked
general
laughter
behind
them
floyd
calderwood
was
shrieking
a
few
of
the
men
leaning
against
the
bar
took
a
casual
look
around
in
time
to
see
claude
heroux
bury
his
woodsman
axe
in
tinker
mccutcheon
head
tinker
was
a
big
man
with
a
black
beard
going
gray
he
got
halfway
up
blood
pouring
down
his
face
in
freshets
then
sat
down
again
heroux
pulled
the
axe
out
of
his
head
tinker
started
to
get
up
again
and
heroux
slung
the
axe
sideways
burying
it
in
his
back
it
made
a
sound
thoroughgood
said
like
a
load
of
laundry
being
dropped
on
a
rug
tinker
flopped
over
the
table
his
cards
spraying
out
of
his
hand
the
others
players
were
hollering
and
bellowing
calderwood
still
shrieking
was
trying
to
pick
up
his
right
hand
with
his
left
as
his
life
blood
ran
out
of
his
stump
of
a
wrist
in
a
steady
stream
stugley
grenier
had
what
thoroughgood
called
a
clutchpisto
meaning
a
gun
in
a
shoulderholster
and
he
was
grabbing
for
it
with
no
success
whatsoever
eddie
king
tried
to
get
up
and
fell
right
out
of
his
chair
on
his
back
before
he
could
get
up
heroux
was
standing
astride
him
the
axe
slung
up
over
his
head
king
screamed
and
held
up
both
hands
in
a
warding
off
gesture
please
claude
i
just
got
married
last
mont
king
screamed
the
axe
came
down
its
head
almost
disappearing
in
king
ample
gut
blood
sprayed
all
the
way
up
to
the
dollar
beamed
roof
eddie
began
to
crawfish
on
the
floor
claude
pulled
the
axe
out
of
him
the
way
a
good
woodsman
will
pull
his
axe
out
of
a
softwood
tree
kind
of
rocking
it
back
and
forth
to
loosen
the
clinging
grip
of
the
sappy
wood
when
it
was
free
he
slung
it
up
over
his
head
he
brought
it
down
again
and
eddie
king
stopped
screaming
claude
heroux
wasn't
done
with
him
however
he
began
to
chop
king
up
like
kindling
wood
at
the
bar
conversation
had
turned
to
what
sort
of
winter
lay
ahead
veraon
stanchfield
a
farmer
from
palmyra
claimed
it
would
be
a
mild
one
fall
rain
uses
up
winter
snow
was
his
scripture
alfie
naugler
who
had
a
farm
out
on
the
naugler
road
in
derry
it
is
gone
now
where
alfie
naugler
once
grew
his
peas
and
beans
and
beets
the
interstate
extension
now
runs
its
mile
sixlane
course
begged
to
disagree
alfie
claimed
the
coming
winter
was
going
to
be
a
jeezer
he
had
seen
as
many
as
eight
rings
on
some
of
the
mohair
caterpillars
he
said
an
unheardof
number
another
man
held
out
for
ice
another
for
mud
the
buzzard
of
was
duly
recalled
jonesy
sent
schooners
of
beer
and
bowls
of
hardcooked
eggs
skidding
down
the
bar
behind
them
the
screaming
went
on
and
the
blood
flowed
in
rivers
at
this
point
in
my
questioning
of
egbert
thoroughgood
i
turned
off
my
cassette
recorder
and
asked
him
how
did
it
happen
are
you
saying
you
didn't
know
it
was
going
on
or
that
you
knew
but
you
let
it
go
on
or
just
what
thoroughgood
chin
sank
down
to
the
top
button
of
his
foodspotted
vest
his
eyebrows
drew
together
he
said
nothing
for
a
long
long
time
outside
it
was
winter
and
i
could
hear
very
faintly
the
yells
and
laughter
of
the
children
sliding
down
the
big
hill
in
mccarron
park
the
silence
in
thoroughgood
room
small
cramped
and
medicinalsmelling
spun
out
so
long
that
i
was
about
to
repeat
my
question
when
he
replied
we
knew
but
it
didn't
seem
to
matter
it
was
like
politics
in
a
way
ayuh
like
that
like
town
business
best
let
people
who
understand
politics
take
care
of
that
and
people
who
understand
town
business
take
care
of
that
such
things
be
best
done
if
working
men
don't
mix
in
are
you
really
talking
about
fate
and
just
afraid
to
come
out
and
say
so
i
asked
suddenly
the
question
was
simply
jerked
out
of
me
and
i
certainly
did
not
expect
thoroughgood
who
was
old
and
slow
and
unlettered
to
answer
it
but
he
did
with
no
surprise
at
all
ayu
he
said
mayhap
i
am
while
the
men
at
the
bar
went
on
talking
about
the
weather
claude
heroux
went
on
cutting
stugley
grenier
had
finally
managed
to
ckar
his
clutchpistol
the
axe
was
descending
for
another
chop
at
eddie
king
who
was
by
then
in
pieces
the
bullet
grenier
fired
struck
the
head
of
the
axe
and
richocheted
off
with
a
spark
and
a
whine
el
katook
got
to
his
feet
and
started
backing
away
he
was
still
holding
the
deck
he
had
been
dealing
from
cards
were
fluttering
off
the
bottom
and
onto
the
floor
claude
came
after
him
el
katook
held
out
his
hands
stugley
grenier
got
off
another
round
which
didn't
come
within
ten
feet
of
heroux
stop
claude
el
katook
said
thoroughgood
said
it
appeared
like
katook
was
trying
to
smile
i
wasn't
with
them
i
didn't
mix
in
at
all
heroux
only
growled
i
was
in
millinocket
el
katook
said
his
voice
starting
to
rise
toward
a
scream
i
was
in
millinocket
i
swear
it
on
my
mother
name
ask
anybody
if
you
don't
believe
meeeee
claude
raised
the
dripping
axe
and
el
katook
sprayed
the
rest
of
the
cards
into
his
face
the
axe
came
down
whistling
el
katook
ducked
the
axehead
buried
itself
in
the
planking
that
formed
the
silver
dollar
back
wall
el
katook
tried
to
run
claude
hauled
the
axe
out
of
the
wall
and
poked
it
between
his
ankles
el
katook
went
sprawling
stugley
grenier
shot
at
heroux
again
this
time
having
a
bit
more
luck
he
had
been
aiming
at
the
crazed
lumberman
head
the
bullet
struck
home
in
the
fleshy
part
of
heroux
thigh
meantime
el
katook
was
crawling
busily
toward
the
door
with
his
hair
hanging
in
his
face
heroux
swung
the
axe
again
snarling
and
gibbering
and
a
moment
later
katook’s
severed
head
was
rolling
across
the
sawduststrewn
floor
the
tongue
popped
bizarrely
out
between
the
teeth
it
rolled
to
a
stop
by
the
booted
foot
of
a
lumberman
named
vamey
who
had
spent
most
of
the
day
in
the
dollar
and
who
by
then
was
so
exquisitely
slopped
that
he
didn't
know
if
he
was
on
land
or
at
sea
he
kicked
the
head
away
without
looking
down
to
see
what
it
was
and
hollered
for
jonesy
to
run
him
down
another
beer
el
katook
crawled
another
three
feet
blood
spraying
from
his
neck
in
a
hightension
jet
before
he
realized
he
was
dead
and
collapsed
that
left
stugley
heroux
turned
on
him
but
stugley
had
run
into
the
outhouse
and
locked
the
door
heroux
chopped
his
way
in
hollering
and
blabbering
and
raving
slobber
falling
from
bis
jaws
when
he
got
in
stugley
was
gone
although
the
cold
leaky
little
room
was
windowless
heroux
stood
there
for
a
moment
head
lowered
powerful
arms
slimed
and
splattered
with
blood
and
then
with
a
roar
he
fipped
up
the
lid
of
the
threeholer
he
was
just
in
time
to
see
stugley
boots
disappearing
under
the
ragged
board
skirting
of
the
outhouse
wall
stugley
grenier
ran
screaming
down
exchange
street
in
the
rain
beshitted
from
top
to
toe
crying
that
he
was
being
murdered
he
survived
the
cutting
party
in
the
silver
dollar
he
was
the
only
one
who
did
but
after
three
months
of
listening
to
jokes
about
his
method
of
escape
he
quitted
the
derry
area
forever
heroux
stepped
out
of
the
toilet
and
stood
in
front
of
it
like
a
bull
after
a
charge
head
down
his
axe
held
in
front
of
him
he
was
puffing
and
blowing
and
covered
with
gore
from
head
to
foot
shut
the
door
claude
that
shitpot
stinks
to
high
heaven
thoroughgood
said
claude
dropped
his
«xe
on
the
floor
and
did
as
he
had
been
asked
he
walked
over
to
the
cardstrewn
table
where
his
victims
had
been
sitting
kicking
one
of
eddie
king
severed
legs
out
of
his
way
then
he
simply
sat
down
and
put
his
head
in
his
arms
the
drinking
and
conversation
at
the
bar
went
on
five
minutes
later
more
men
began
to
pile
in
three
or
four
sheriffs
deputies
among
them
the
one
in
charge
was
lal
machen
father
and
when
he
saw
the
mess
he
had
a
heart
attack
and
had
to
be
taken
away
to
dr
shratt
office
claude
heroux
was
led
away
he
was
docile
when
they
took
him
more
asleep
than
awake
that
night
the
bars
all
up
and
down
exchange
and
baker
streets
boomed
and
hollered
with
news
of
the
slaughter
a
righteous
drunken
sort
of
fury
began
to
build
up
and
when
the
bars
closed
better
than
seventy
men
headed
downtown
toward
the
jail
and
the
courthouse
they
had
torches
and
lanterns
sonic
were
carrying
guns
some
had
axes
some
had
peavies
the
county
sheriff
wasn't
due
from
bangor
until
the
noon
stage
the
next
day
so
he
wasn't
there
and
goose
machen
was
laid
up
in
dr
shratt
infirmary
with
his
heart
attack
the
two
deputies
who
were
sitting
in
the
office
playing
cribbage
heard
the
mob
coming
and
got
out
of
there
fast
the
drunks
broke
in
and
dragged
claude
heroux
out
of
his
cell
he
didn't
protest
much
he
seemed
dazed
vacant
they
carried
him
on
their
shoulders
like
a
football
hero
down
to
canal
street
they
carried
him
and
there
they
lynched
him
from
an
old
elm
that
overhung
the
canal
he
was
so
far
gone
that
he
didn't
kick
but
twice
egbert
thoroughgood
said
it
was
so
far
as
the
town
records
show
the
only
lynching
to
ever
take
place
in
this
part
of
maine
and
almost
needless
to
say
it
was
not
reported
in
the
derry
news
many
of
those
who
had
gone
on
drinking
unconcernedly
while
heroux
went
about
his
business
in
the
silver
dollar
were
in
the
necktie
party
that
strung
him
up
by
midnight
their
mood
had
changed
i
asked
thoroughgood
my
final
question
had
he
seen
anyone
he
didn't
know
during
that
day
violent
activities
someone
who
struck
him
as
strange
out
of
place
funny
even
clownish
someone
who
would
have
been
drinking
at
the
bar
that
afternoon
someone
who
had
maybe
turned
into
one
of
the
rabblerousers
that
night
as
the
drinking
went
on
and
the
talk
turned
to
lynching
mayhap
there
was
thoroughgood
replied
he
was
tired
by
then
drooping
ready
for
his
afternoon
nap
it
were
a
long
time
ago
mister
long
and
long
but
you
remember
something
i
said
i
remember
thinkin
that
there
must
be
a
county
fair
up
bangor
way
thoroughgood
said
i
was
having
a
beer
in
the
bloody
bucket
that
night
the
bucket
was
about
six
doors
from
the
silver
dollar
there
was
a
fella
in
there
comical
sort
of
fella
doing
flips
and
rollovers
jugglin
glasses
tricks
put
four
dimes
on
his
forrid
and
they'd
stay
right
there
comical
you
know
his
bony
chin
had
sunk
to
his
chest
again
he
was
going
to
sleep
right
in
front
of
me
spittle
began
to
bubble
at
the
corners
of
his
mouth
which
had
as
many
tucks
and
wrinkles
as
a
lady
changepurse
seen
him
a
few
now
n
thens
since
thoroughgood
said
figure
maybe
he
had
such
a
good
time
that
night
that
he
decided
to
stick
around
yeah
he
been
around
a
long
time
i
said
his
only
response
was
a
weak
snore
thoroughgood
had
gone
to
sleep
in
his
chair
by
the
window
with
his
medicines
and
nostrums
lined
up
beside
him
on
the
sill
soldiers
of
old
age
at
muster
i
turned
off
my
taperecorder
and
just
sat
looking
at
him
for
a
moment
this
strange
timetraveller
from
the
year
or
so
who
remembered
when
there
were
no
cars
no
electric
lights
no
airplanes
no
state
of
arizona
pennywise
had
been
there
guiding
them
down
the
path
toward
another
gaudy
sacrifice
just
one
more
in
derry
long
history
of
gaudy
sacrifices
that
one
in
september
of
ushered
in
a
heightened
period
of
terror
that
would
include
the
eastertide
explosion
of
the
kitchener
ironworks
the
following
year
this
raises
some
interesting
and
for
all
i
know
vitally
important
questions
what
does
it
really
eat
for
instance
i
know
that
some
of
the
children
have
been
partially
eaten
they
show
bitemarks
at
least
but
perhaps
it
is
we
who
drive
it
to
cd
that
certainly
we
have
all
been
taught
since
earliest
childhood
that
what
the
monster
does
when
it
catches
you
in
the
deep
wood
is
eat
you
that
is
perhaps
the
worst
thing
we
can
conceive
but
its
really
faith
that
monsters
live
on
isn't
it
i
am
led
irresistibly
to
this
conclusion
food
may
be
life
but
the
source
of
power
is
not
food
but
faith
and
who
is
more
capable
of
a
total
act
of
faith
than
a
child
but
there
a
problem
kids
grow
up
in
the
church
power
is
perpetuated
and
renewed
by
periodic
ritualistic
acts
in
derry
power
seems
to
be
perpetuated
and
renewed
by
periodic
ritualistic
acts
too
can
it
be
that
it
protects
itself
by
the
simple
fact
that
as
the
children
grow
into
the
adults
they
become
either
incapable
of
faith
or
crippled
by
a
sort
of
spiritual
and
imaginative
arthritis
yes
i
think
that
the
secret
here
and
if
i
make
the
calls
how
much
will
they
remember
how
much
will
they
believe
enough
to
end
this
horror
once
and
for
all
or
only
enough
to
get
them
killed
they
are
being
called
i
know
that
much
each
murder
in
this
new
cycle
has
been
a
call
we
almost
killed
it
twice
and
in
the
end
we
drove
it
deep
in
its
warren
of
tunnels
and
stinking
rooms
under
the
city
but
i
think
it
knows
another
secret
although
it
may
be
immortal
or
almost
so
we
are
not
it
had
only
to
wait
until
the
act
of
faith
which
made
us
potential
monsterkillers
as
well
as
sources
of
power
had
become
impossible
twentyseven
years
perhaps
a
period
of
sleep
for
it
as
short
and
refreshing
as
an
afternoon
nap
would
be
for
us
and
when
it
awakes
it
is
the
same
but
a
third
of
our
lives
has
gone
by
our
perspectives
have
narrowed
our
faith
in
the
magic
that
makes
magic
possible
has
worn
off
like
the
shine
on
a
new
pair
of
shoes
after
a
hard
day
walking
why
call
us
back
why
not
just
let
us
die
because
we
nearly
killed
it
because
we
frightened
it
i
think
because
it
wants
revenge
and
now
now
that
we
no
longer
believe
in
santa
claus
the
tooth
fairy
hansel
and
gretel
or
the
troll
under
the
bridge
it
is
ready
for
us
come
on
back
it
says
come
on
back
let
finish
our
business
in
derry
bring
your
jacks
and
your
marbles
and
your
yoyos
we'll
play
come
on
back
and
we'll
see
if
you
remember
the
simplest
thing
of
all
how
it
is
to
be
children
secure
in
belief
and
thus
afraid
of
the
dark
on
that

chapter
in
the
watches
of
the
night
the
derry
public
library
/
a.m
when
ben
hanscom
finished
the
story
of
the
silver
slugs
they
wanted
to
talk
but
mike
told
them
he
wanted
them
all
to
get
some
sleep
you've
had
enough
for
now
he
said
but
mike
was
the
one
who
looked
as
if
he
had
had
enough
his
face
was
tired
and
drawn
and
beverly
thought
he
looked
physically
ill
but
we're
not
done
eddie
said
what
about
the
rest
of
it
i
still
don't
remember
mike
rfrright
bill
said
either
we'll
remember
or
we
wwon't
i
think
we
wwill
we've
remembered
all
that
we
nuhneed
to
maybe
all
that
good
for
us
riche
suggested
mike
nodded
we'll
meet
tomorrow
then
he
glanced
at
the
clock
later
today
i
mean
here
beverly
asked
mike
shook
his
head
slowly
i
suggest
we
meet
on
kansas
street
where
bill
used
to
hide
his
bike
we're
going
down
into
the
barrens
eddie
said
and
suddenly
shivered
mike
nodded
again
there
was
a
moment
of
quiet
while
they
looked
around
at
each
other
then
bill
got
to
his
feet
and
the
others
rose
with
him
want
you
all
to
be
careful
for
the
rest
of
the
night
mike
said
it
been
here
it
can
be
wherever
you
are
but
this
meeting
has
made
me
feel
better
he
looked
at
bill
td
say
it
still
can
be
done
wouldn't
you
bill
bill
nodded
slowly
yes
i
think
it
still
can
be
done
tt
will
know
that
too
mike
said
and
it
will
do
whatever
it
can
to
slug
the
odds
in
its
favor
what
do
we
do
if
it
shows
up
richie
asked
hold
our
noses
shut
our
eyes
turn
around
three
times
and
think
good
thoughts
puff
some
magic
dust
in
its
face
sing
old
elvis
presley
songs
what
mike
shook
his
head
if
i
could
tell
you
that
there
would
be
no
problem
would
there
all
i
know
is
that
there
another
force
at
least
there
was
when
we
were
kids
that
wanted
us
to
stay
alive
and
to
do
the
job
maybe
it
still
there
he
shrugged
it
was
a
weary
gesture
i
thought
two
maybe
as
many
as
three
of
you
would
be
gone
by
the
time
we
started
our
meet
ing
tonight
missing
or
dead
just
seeing
you
turn
up
gave
me
reason
to
hope
richie
looked
at
his
watch
quarter
past
one
how
the
time
flies
when
you're
having
fun
right
haystack
beep
beep
richie
ben
said
and
smiled
wanly
you
want
to
walk
back
to
the
tuhtuhtownhouse
with
me
beverly
bill
asked
all
right
she
was
putting
on
her
coat
the
library
seemed
very
silent
now
shadowy
frightening
bill
felt
the
last
two
days
catching
up
with
him
all
at
once
piling
up
on
his
back
if
it
had
just
been
weariness
that
would
have
been
okay
but
it
was
more
a
feeling
that
he
was
cracking
up
dreaming
having
delusions
of
paranoia
a
sensation
of
being
watched
maybe
i'm
really
not
here
at
all
he
thought
maybe
i'm
in
dr
seward
lunatic
asylum
with
the
count
crumbling
townhouse
next
door
and
renfield
just
across
the
hall
him
with
his
flies
and
me
with
my
monsters
both
of
us
sure
the
party
is
really
going
on
and
dressed
to
the
nines
for
it
not
in
tuxedos
but
in
straitwaistcoats
what
about
you
richie
richie
shook
his
head
tm
going
to
let
haystack
and
kaspbrak
lead
me
home
he
said
right
feller
sur
ben
said
he
looked
briefly
at
beverly
who
was
standing
close
to
bill
and
felt
a
pain
he
had
almost
forgotten
a
new
memory
trembled
almost
within
his
grasp
then
floated
away
what
about
you
mmmik
bill
asked
want
to
walk
with
bev
and
mme
mike
shook
his
head
tve
got
to
that
was
when
beverly
screamed
a
highpitched
hurt
sound
in
the
stillness
the
vaulted
dome
overhead
picked
it
up
and
the
echoes
were
like
the
laughter
of
banshees
flying
and
flapping
around
them
bill
turned
toward
her
richie
dropped
his
sportcoat
as
he
was
taking
it
off
the
back
of
his
chair
there
was
a
crash
of
glass
as
eddie
arm
swept
an
empty
gin
bottle
onto
the
floor
beverly
was
backing
away
from
them
her
hands
held
out
her
face
as
white
as
good
bond
paper
her
eyes
deep
in
duskypurple
sockets
bulged
my
hands
she
screamed
my
hands
what
bill
began
and
then
he
saw
the
blood
dripping
slowly
between
her
shaking
fingers
he
started
forward
and
felt
sudden
lines
of
painful
warmth
cross
his
own
hands
the
pain
was
not
sharp
it
was
more
like
the
pain
one
sometimes
feels
in
an
old
healed
wound
the
old
scars
on
his
palms
the
ones
which
had
reappeared
in
england
had
broken
open
and
were
bleeding
he
looked
sideways
and
saw
eddie
kaspbrak
peering
stupidly
down
at
his
own
hands
they
were
also
bleeding
so
were
mike
and
richie
and
ben
we're
in
it
to
the
end
aren't
we
beverly
asked
she
had
begun
to
cry
this
sound
was
also
magnified
in
the
library
still
emptiness
the
building
itself
seemed
to
be
weeping
with
her
bill
thought
that
if
he
had
to
listen
to
that
sound
for
long
he
would
go
mad
god
help
us
we're
in
it
to
the
end
she
sobbed
ad
a
runner
of
snot
depended
from
one
of
her
nostrils
she
wiped
it
off
with
the
back
of
one
shaking
hand
and
more
blood
dripped
on
the
floor
quhquhhick
bill
said
and
seized
eddie
hand
what
quick
he
held
out
his
other
hand
and
after
a
moment
beverly
took
it
she
was
still
crying
ye
mike
said
he
looked
dazed
almost
drugged
yes
that
right
isn't
it
it
starting
again
isn't
it
bill
it
all
starting
to
happen
again
yyyes
i
ththink
mike
took
eddie
hand
and
richie
took
beverly
other
hand
for
a
moment
ben
only
looked
at
them
and
then
like
a
man
in
a
dream
he
raised
his
bloody
hands
to
either
side
and
stepped
between
mike
and
richie
he
grasped
their
hands
the
circle
closed
ah
chiid
this
is
the
ritual
of
chiid
and
the
turtle
cannot
help
us
bill
tried
to
scream
but
no
sound
came
out
he
saw
eddie
head
tilt
back
the
cords
on
his
neck
standing
out
bev
hips
bucked
twice
fiercely
as
if
in
an
orgasm
as
short
and
sharp
as
the
crack
of
a
pistol
mike
mouth
moved
strangely
seeming
to
laugh
and
grimace
at
the
same
time
in
the
silence
of
the
library
doors
banged
open
and
shut
the
sound
rolling
like
bowling
balls
in
the
periodicals
room
magazines
flew
in
a
windless
hurricane
in
carole
banner
office
the
library
ibm
typewriter
whirred
into
life
and
typed
hethrusts
hisfistsagainst
thepostsandstillinsistshesees
theghostshethrustshisfistsagainstthe
the
typeball
jammed
the
typewriter
sizzled
and
uttered
a
thick
electronic
belch
as
everything
inside
overloaded
in
stack
two
the
shelf
of
occult
books
suddenly
tipped
over
spilling
edgar
cayce
nostradamus
charles
fort
and
the
apocrypha
everywhere
bill
felt
an
exalting
sense
of
power
he
was
dimly
aware
that
he
had
an
erection
and
that
every
hair
on
his
head
was
standing
up
straight
the
sense
of
force
in
the
completed
circle
was
incredible
all
the
doors
in
the
library
slammed
shut
in
unison
the
grandfather
clock
behind
the
checkout
desk
chimed
once
then
it
was
gone
as
if
someone
had
flicked
off
a
switch
they
dropped
their
hands
looking
at
each
other
dazed
no
one
said
anything
as
the
sense
of
power
ebbed
bill
felt
a
terrible
sense
of
doom
creep
over
him
he
looked
at
ther
white
strained
faces
and
then
down
at
his
hands
blood
was
smeared
there
but
the
wounds
which
stan
uris
had
made
with
a
jagged
piece
of
coke
bottle
in
august
had
closed
up
again
leaving
only
crooked
white
lines
like
knotted
twine
he
thought
that
was
the
last
time
the
seven
of
us
were
together
the
day
stan
made
those
cuts
in
the
barrens
stan
not
here
he
dead
and
this
is
the
last
time
the
six
of
us
are
going
to
be
together
i
know
it
i
feel
it
beverly
was
pressed
against
him
tembling
bill
put
an
arm
around
her
they
all
looked
at
him
their
eyes
huge
and
bright
in
the
dimness
the
long
table
where
they
had
sat
littered
with
empty
bottles
glasses
and
overflowing
ashtrays
a
little
island
of
light
that
enough
bill
said
huskily
enough
entertainment
for
one
evening
we'll
save
the
ballroom
dancing
for
another
time
i
remembered
beverly
said
she
looked
up
at
bill
her
eyes
huge
her
pale
cheeks
wet
i
remembered
everything
my
father
finding
out
about
you
guys
running
bowers
and
criss
and
huggins
how
i
ran
the
tunnel
the
birds

eddie

bill

some
rest

late

beverly
said
no
i
have

and
i
have
to
write
a
few
things
down
the
minutes
of
the
meeting
if
you
like
i
won't
be
long
go
ahead
they
moved
toward
the
door
not
talking
much
bill
and
beverly
were
together
eddie
richie
and
ben
behind
them
bill
held
the
door
for
her
and
she
murmured
thanks
as
she
went
out
onto
the
wide
granite
steps
bill
thought
how
young
she
looked
how
vulnerable
he
was
dismally
aware
that
he
might
be
falling
in
love
with
her
again
he
tried
to
think
of
audra
but
audra
seemed
far
away
she
would
be
sleeping
in
their
house
in
fleet
now
as
the
sun
came
up
and
the
milkman
began
his
rounds
derry
sky
had
clouded
over
again
and
a
low
groundfog
lay
across
the
empty
street
in
thick
runners
further
up
the
street
the
derry
community
house
narrow
tall
victorian
brooded
in
blackness
bill
thought
and
whatever
walked
in
community
house
walked
alone
he
had
to
stifle
a
wild
cackle
their
footfalls
seemed
very
loud
beverly
hand
touched
his
and
bill
took
it
gratefully
it
started
before
we
were
ready
she
said
would
we
ehehever
have
been
rread
you
would
have
been
big
bill
the
touch
of
her
hand
was
suddenly
both
wonderful
and
necessary
he
wondered
what
it
would
be
like
to
touch
her
breasts
for
the
second
time
in
his
life
and
suspected
that
before
this
long
night
was
over
he
would
know
fuller
now
mature
and
his
hand
would
find
hair
when
he
cupped
the
swelling
of
her
mons
veneris
he
thought
loved
you
beverly
i
love
you
ben
loved
you
he
laves
you
we
loved
you
then
we
love
you
now
we
better
because
it
starting
no
way
out
now
he
glanced
behind
and
saw
the
library
half
ablock
away
richie
and
eddie
were
on
the
top
step
ben
was
standing
at
the
bottom
looking
after
them
his
hands
were
stuffed
in
his
pockets
his
shoulders
were
slumped
and
seen
through
the
drifting
lens
of
the
low
fog
he
might
almost
have
been
eleven
gain
if
he
had
been
able
to
send
ben
a
thought
bill
would
have
sent
this
one
it
doesn't
matter
ben
the
love
is
what
matters
the
caring
it
always
the
desire
never
the
time
maybe
that
all
we
get
to
take
with
us
when
we
go
out
of
the
blue
and
into
the
black
cold
comfort
maybe
but
better
than
no
comfort
at
all
my
father
kne
beverly
said
suddenly
i
came
home
one
day
from
the
barrens
and
he
just
knew
did
i
ever
tell
you
what
he
used
to
say
to
me
when
he
was
mad
what
i
worry
about
you
bevvie
that
what
he
used
to
say
i
worry
a
jot
she
laughed
and
shivered
at
the
same
time
i
think
he
meant
to
hurt
me
bill
i
mean
he'd
hurt
me
before
but
that
last
time
was
different
he
was
well
in
many
ways
he
was
a
strange
man
i
loved
him
i
loved
him
very
much
but
she
looked
at
him
perhaps
wanting
him
to
say
it
for
her
he
wouldn't
it
was
something
she
was
going
to
have
to
say
for
herself
sooner
or
later
lies
and
selfdeceptions
had
become
a
ballast
they
could
not
afford
hated
him
too
she
said
and
her
hand
bore
down
convulsively
upon
bill
for
a
long
second
i
never
told
that
to
anyone
in
my
life
before
i
thought
god
would
strike
me
dead
if
i
ever
said
it
out
loud
say
it
again
then
no
go
on
it'll
hurt
but
maybe
it
festered
in
there
long
enough
say
it
i
hated
my
da
she
said
and
began
to
sob
helplessly
i
hated
him
i
was
scared
of
him
i
hated
him
i
could
never
be
a
good
enough
girl
to
suit
him
and
i
hated
him
i
did
but
i
loved
him
too
he
stopped
and
held
her
tight
her
arms
went
around
him
in
a
panicky
grip
her
tears
wet
the
side
of
his
neck
he
was
very
conscious
of
her
body
ripe
and
firm
he
moved
his
torso
away
from
hers
slightly
not
wanting
her
to
feel
the
erection
he
was
getting
but
she
moved
against
him
again
we'd
spent
the
morning
down
there
she
said
playing
tag
or
something
like
that
something
harmless
we
hadn't
even
talked
about
it
that
day
at
least
not
then
we
usually
talked
about
it
every
day
at
some
point
though
remember
ye
he
said
at
some
pppoint
i
remember
tt
was
overcast
hot
we
played
most
of
the
morning
i
went
home
around
eleven
thirty
i
thought
i'd
have
a
sandwich
and
a
bowl
of
soup
after
i
took
a
shower
and
then
i'd
go
back
and
play
some
more
my
parents
were
both
working
but
he
was
there
he
was
home
he
lower
main
street
/
a.m
threw
her
across
the
room
before
she
had
even
gotten
all
he
way
through
the
door
a
startled
scream
was
jerked
out
of
her
and
then
cut
off
as
she
hit
the
wall
with
shoulder
numbing
force
she
collapsed
onto
their
sagging
sofa
looking
around
wildly
the
door
to
the
front
hall
banged
shut
her
father
had
been
standing
behind
it
i
worry
about
you
bevvie
he
said
sometimes
i
worry
a
lot
you
know
that
i
tell
you
that
don't
i
you
bet
i
do
daddy
what
he
was
walking
slowly
toward
her
across
the
living
room
his
face
thoughtful
sad
deadly
she
didn't
want
to
see
that
last
but
it
was
there
like
the
blind
shine
of
dirt
on
still
water
he
was
nibbling
reflectively
on
a
knuckle
of
his
right
hand
he
was
dressed
in
his
khakis
and
when
she
glanced
down
she
saw
that
his
hightopped
shoes
were
leaving
tracks
on
her
mother
carpet
t'u
have
to
get
the
vacuum
out
she
thought
incoherently
vacuum
that
up
if
he
leaves
me
able
to
vacuum
if
he
it
was
mud
.black
mud
her
mind
sideslipped
alarmingly
she
was
back
in
the
barrens
with
bill
riche
eddie
and
the
others
there
was
black
viscous
mud
like
the
kind
on
daddy
shoes
down
there
in
the
barrens
in
the
swampy
place
where
the
stuff
richie
called
bamboo
stood
in
a
skeletal
white
grove
when
the
wind
blew
the
stalks
rattled
together
hollowly
producing
a
sound
like
voodoo
drums
and
had
her
father
been
down
in
the
barrens
had
her
father
whap
his
hand
rocketed
down
in
a
wide
sweeping
orbit
and
struck
her
face
her
head
thudded
back
against
the
wall
he
hooked
his
thumbs
in
his
belt
and
looked
at
her
with
that
expression
of
deadly
disconnected
curiosity
she
felt
a
trickle
of
blood
running
warmly
from
the
left
corner
of
her
lower
lip
have
seen
you
getting
big
he
said
and
she
thought
he
would
say
something
more
but
for
the
time
being
that
seemed
to
be
all
daddy
what
are
you
talking
about
she
asked
in
a
low
trembling
voice
if
you
lie
to
me
i'll
beat
you
within
an
inch
of
your
life
bevvie
he
said
and
she
realized
with
horror
that
he
wasn't
looking
at
ler
he
was
looking
at
the
currier
and
ives
picture
over
her
head
on
the
wall
above
the
sofa
her
mind
sideslipped
crazily
again
and
she
was
four
sitting
in
the
bathtub
with
her
blue
plastic
boat
and
her
popeye
soap
her
father
so
big
and
so
wellloved
was
kneeling
beside
her
dressed
in
gray
twill
pants
and
a
strappy
teeshirt
a
washcloth
in
one
hand
and
a
glass
of
orange
soda
in
the
other
soaping
her
back
and
saying
lemme
see
those
ears
bevvie
your
ma
needs
taters
for
supper
and
she
could
hear
her
small
self
giggling
looking
up
at
his
slightly
grizzled
face
which
she
had
then
believed
must
be
eternal
it
i
won't
lie
daddy
she
said
what
wrong
her
view
of
him
was
gradually
shivering
apart
as
the
tears
came
you
been
down
there
in
the
bar'ns
with
a
gang
of
boys
her
heart
leaped
her
eyes
dropped
to
his
mudcaked
shoes
again
that
black
clingy
mud
if
you
stepped
into
it
too
deep
it
would
suck
your
sneaker
or
your
loafer
right
off
and
both
richie
and
bill
believed
that
if
you
went
in
all
the
way
it
turned
to
quickmud
i
play
down
there
somet
whap
the
hand
covered
with
hard
calluses
rocketing
down
again
she
cried
out
hurt
afraid
that
look
on
his
face
scared
her
and
the
way
he
wouldn't
look
at
her
scared
her
too
there
was
something
wrong
with
him
he
had
been
getting
worse
what
if
he
meant
to
kill
her
what
if
oh
stop
it
beverly
he
your
father
and
fathers
don't
kill
daughters
he
lost
control
then
what
if
what
have
you
let
them
do
to
you
do
what
she
had
no
idea
what
he
meant
take
your
pants
off
her
confusion
increased
nothing
he
said
seemed
connected
to
anything
else
trying
to
follow
him
made
her
feel
seasick
almost
what
why
'
his
hand
rose
she
flinched
back
take
them
off
bevvie
i
want
to
see
if
you
are
intact
now
there
was
a
new
image
crazier
than
the
rest
she
saw
herself
pulling
her
jeans
off
and
one
of
her
legs
coming
off
with
them
her
father
belting
her
around
the
room
as
she
tried
to
hop
away
from
him
on
her
one
good
leg
daddy
shouting
j
knew
you
wasn't
intact
i
knew
it
i
knew
it
daddy
i
don't
know
what
his
hand
came
down
not
slapping
this
time
but
clutching
it
bit
into
her
shoulder
with
furious
strength
she
screamed
he
pulled
her
up
and
for
the
first
time
looked
directly
into
her
eyes
she
screamed
again
at
what
she
saw
there
it
was
nothing
her
father
was
gone
and
beverly
suddenly
understood
that
she
was
alone
in
the
apartment
with
it
alone
with
it
on
this
dozey
august
morning
there
was
not
the
thick
sense
of
power
and
untinctured
evil
she
had
felt
in
the
house
on
neibolt
street
a
week
and
a
half
ago
it
had
been
diluted
somehow
by
her
father
essential
humanity
but
it
was
here
working
through
him
he
threw
her
aside
she
struck
the
coffee
table
tripped
over
it
and
went
sprawling
on
the
floor
with
a
cry
this
is
how
it
happens
she
thought
ti
tell
bill
so
he
understands
it
everywhere
in
derry
it
just
it
just
fills
the
hollow
places
that
all
she
rolled
over
her
father
was
walking
toward
her
she
skidded
away
from
him
on
the
seat
of
her
jeans
her
hair
in
her
eyes
i
know
you
been
down
there
he
said
i
was
told
i
didn't
believe
it
i
didn't
believe
my
bevwvie
would
be
hanging
around
with
a
gang
of
boys
then
i
seen
you
myself
this
morning
my
bewvie
with
a
bunch
of
boys
not
even
twelve
and
hanging
around
with
a
bunch
of
boys
this
latter
thought
seemed
to
send
him
into
a
fresh
rage
it
trembled
through
his
scrawny
frame
like
volts
not
even
twelve
years
ol
he
shouted
and
fetched
a
kick
at
her
thigh
that
made
her
scream
his
jaws
snapped
over
this
fact
or
concept
or
whatever
it
was
to
him
like
the
jaws
of
a
hungry
dog
worrying
a
piece
of
meat
not
even
twelve
not
even
twelve
not
even
twelve
he
kicked
beverly
scrambled
away
they
had
worked
their
way
into
the
kitchen
area
of
the
apartment
now
his
workboot
struck
the
drawer
under
the
stove
making
the
pots
and
pans
inside
jangle
don't
you
run
from
me
bevvi
he
said
you
don't
want
to
do
that
or
it'll
be
the
worse
for
you
believe
me
now
believe
your
dad
this
is
serious
hanging
around
with
the
boys
letting
them
do
god
knows
what
to
you
not
even
twelve
that
serious
christ
knows
he
grabbed
her
and
jerked
her
to
her
feet
by
her
shoulder
you're
a
pretty
girl
he
said
there
plenty
of
people
happy
to
roon
a
pretty
girl
plenty
of
pretty
girls
willing
to
be
roont
you
been
a
slutchild
to
them
boys
bevvie
at
last
she
understood
what
it
had
put
in
his
head
except
part
of
her
knew
the
thought
might
almost
have
been
there
all
along
that
it
might
only
have
used
the
tools
that
had
been
there
just
lying
around
waiting
to
be
picked
up
no
daddy
no
daddy
seen
you
smoking
he
bellowed
this
time
he
struck
her
with
the
palm
of
his
hand
hard
enough
to
send
her
reeling
back
in
drunken
strides
to
the
kitchen
table
where
she
sprawled
a
flare
of
agony
in
the
small
of
her
back
the
salt
and
pepper
shakers
fell
to
the
floor
the
pepper
shaker
broke
black
flowers
bloomed
and
disappeared
before
her
eyes
sounds
seemed
too
deep
she
saw
his
face
something
in
his
face
he
was
looking
at
her
chest
she
was
suddenly
aware
that
her
blouse
had
come
untucked
that
some
of
the
buttons
had
popped
off
and
that
she
wasn't
wearing
a
bra
as
of
yet
she
owned
only
one
a
training
bra
her
mind
sideslipped
back
to
the
house
at
neibolt
street
when
bill
had
given
her
his
shirt
she
had
been
aware
of
the
way
her
breasts
poked
at
the
thin
cotton
material
but
their
occasional
skittering
glances
had
not
bothered
her
these
had
seemed
perfectly
natural
and
bill
look
had
seemed
more
than
natural
it
had
seemed
warm
and
wanted
if
deeply
dangerous
now
she
felt
guilt
mix
with
her
terror
was
her
father
so
wrong
hadn't
she
had
you
been
a
slutchild
to
them
thoughts
bad
thoughts
thoughts
of
whatever
it
was
that
he
was
talking
about
it
not
the
same
thing
it
not
the
same
thing
as
the
way
you
been
a
slutchild
he
looking
at
me
now
not
the
same
she
tucked
her
blouse
back
in
bevvi
daddy
we
just
play
that
all
we
play
we
we
don't
do
anything
like
anything
bad
we
it
seen
you
smoking
he
said
again
walking
toward
her
his
eyes
moved
across
her
chest
and
her
narrow
uncurved
hips
he
chanted
suddenly
in
a
high
schoolboy
voice
that
frightened
her
even
more
a
girl
who
will
chew
gum
will
smoke
a
girl
who
will
smoke
will
drink
and
a
girl
who
will
drink
everyone
knows
what
a
girl
like
that
will
do
didn't
do
anything
she
screamed
at
him
as
his
hands
descended
on
her
shoulders
he
was
not
pinching
or
hurting
now
his
hands
were
gentle
and
that
was
somehow
scariest
of
all
beverly
he
said
with
the
inarguable
mad
logic
of
the
totally
obsessed
i
seen
you
with
boys
now
you
want
to
tell
me
what
a
girl
does
with
boys
down
in
all
that
trashwood
if
it
ain't
what
a
girl
does
on
her
back
let
me
alon
she
cried
at
him
the
anger
flashed
up
from
a
deep
well
she
had
never
suspected
the
anger
made
a
bluish
yellow
flame
in
her
head
it
threatened
her
thoughts
all
the
times
he
had
scared
her
all
the
times
he
had
shamed
her
all
the
times
he
had
hurt
her
you
just
let
me
alone
don't
talk
to
your
daddy
like

said
sounding
startled

maybe
maybe
not
i'm
going
to
check
and
make
sure
i

how
take
your
pants
off
no
his
eyes
widened
showing
yellowed
cornea
all
the
way
around
the
deep
blue
irises
what
did
you
say
i
said
no
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
hers
and
perhaps
he
saw
the
blazing
anger
there
the
bright
upsurge
of
rebellion
who
told
you
bevve
who
told
you
we
play
down
there
was
it
a
stranger
was
it
a
man
dressed
in
orange
and
silver

he
look
like
a
clown
even
if
he
wasn't
a
clown
what
was
his
name
bevvie
you
want
to
stop
no

she
told
him
he
swung
his
hand
again
not
open
but
this
time
closed
in
a
fist
meant
to
break
something
beverly
ducked
his
fist
whistled
over
her
head
and
crashed
into
the
wall
he
howled
and
let
go
of
her
putting
the
fist
to
his
mouth
she
backed
away
from
him
in
quick
mincing
steps
you
come
back

n
she
said
you
want
to
hurt

i

she
said
and
i
will
he
leaped
at
her
with
such
scrawny
catlike
agility
that
although
she
suspected
such
a
leap
was
coming
she
was
almost
caught
she
fumbled
for
the
kitchen
doorknob
pulled
the
door
open
just
wide
enough
so
she
could
slip
though
and
then
she
was
running
down
the
hall
toward
the
front
door
running
in
a
dream
of
panic
as
she
would
run
from
mrs
kersh
twenty
seven
years
later
behind
her
al
marsh
crashed
against
the
door
slamming
it
shut
again
cracking
it
down
the
center
you
get
back
here
right
now
bevvi
he
howled
yanking
it
open
and
coming
after
her
the
front
door
was
on
the
latch
she
had
come
home
the
back
way
one
of
her
trembling
hands
worked
at
the
lock
while
the
other
yanked
fruitlessly
at
the
knob
behind
her
father
howled
again
the
sound
of
an
take
those
pants
off
slutchild
animal
she
turned
the
lockknob
and
the
front
door
finally
swept
open
hot
breath
plunged
up
and
down
in
her
throat
she
looked
over
her
shoulder
and
saw
him
right
behind
her
reaching
for
her
grinning
and
grimacing
his
horsey
yellow
teeth
a
beartrap
in
his
mouth
beverly
bolted
out
through
the
screen
door
and
felt
his
fingers
skid
down
the
back
of
her
blouse
without
catching
hold
she
flew
down
the
steps
overbalanced
and
went
sprawling
on
the
concrete
walkway
erasing
the
skin
from
both
knees
you
get
back
here
now
bevvie
or
before
god
i'll
whip
the
skin
off
you
he
came
down
the
steps
and
she
scrambled
to
her
feet
holes
in
the
legs
of
her
jeans
your
pants
off
her
kneecaps
sizzling
blood
exposed
nerveendings
singing
onward
christian
soldiers
she
looked
back
and
here
he
came
again
al
marsh
janitor
and
custodian
a
gray
man
dressed
n
khaki
pants
and
a
khaki
shirt
with
two
flap
pockets
a
keyring
attached
to
his
belt
by
a
chain
his
hair
flying
but
he
wasn't
in
his
eyes
the
essential
he
who
had
washed
her
back
and
punched
her
in
the
gut
and
had
done
both
because
he
worried
about
her
worried
a
lot
the
he
who
had
once
tried
to
braid
her
hair
when
she
was
seven
made
a
botch
of
it
and
then
got
giggling
with
her
about
the
way
it
stuck
out
everyway
the
he
who
knew
how
to
make
cinnamon
eggnogs
on
sunday
that
tasted
better
than
anything
you
could
buy
for
a
quarter
at
the
derry
ice
cream
bar
the
fatherhe
maleman
of
her
life
delivering
a
mixed
post
from
that
other
sexual
state
none
of
that
was
in
his
eyes
now
she
saw
blank
murder
there
she
saw
it
there
she
ran
she
ran
from
it
mr
pasquale
looked
up
startled
from
where
he
was
watering
his
crabgrassy
lawn
and
listening
to
the
red
sox
game
on
a
portable
radio
sitting
on
his
porch
rail
the
zinnerman
kids
stood
back
from
the
old
hudson
hornet
which
they
had
bought
for
twentyfive
dollars
and
washed
almost
every
day
one
of
them
was
holding
a
hose
the
other
a
bucket
of
soapsuds
both
were
slackjawed
mrs
denton
looked
out
of
her
secondfloor
apartment
one
of
her
six
daughter
dresses
in
her
lap
more
mending
in
a
basket
on
the
floor
her
mouth
full
of
pins
little
lars
theramenius
pulled
his
red
ball
flyer
wagon
quickly
off
the
cracked
sidewalk
and
stood
on
bucky
pasquale
dying
lawn
he
burst
into
tears
as
bevvie
who
had
spent
a
patient
morning
that
spring
showing
him
how
to
tie
his
sneakers
so
they
would
stay
tied
flashed
by
him
screaming
her
eyes
wide
a
moment
later
her
father
passed
hollering
at
her
and
lars
who
was
then
three
and
who
would
die
twelve
years
later
in
a
motorcycle
accident
saw
something
terrible
and
inhuman
in
mr
marsh
face
he
had
nightmares
for
three
weeks
after
in
them
he
saw
mr
marsh
turning
into
a
spider
inside
his
clothes
beverly
ran
she
was
perfectly
aware
that
she
might
be
running
for
her
life
if
her
father
caught
her
now
it
wouldn't
matter
that
they
were
on
the
street
people
did
crazy
things
in
derry
sometimes
she
didn't
have
to
read
the
newspapers
or
know
the
town
peculiar
history
to
understand
that
if
he
caught
her
he
would
choke
her
or
beat
her
or
kick
her
and
when
i
was
over
someone
would
come
and
collect
him
and
he
would
sit
in
a
cell
the
way
eddie
cochran
stepfather
was
sitting
in
a
cell
dazed
and
uncomprehending
she
ran
toward
downtown
passing
more
and
more
people
as
she
went
they
stared
first
at
her
then
at
her
pursuing
father
and
they
looked
surprised
some
of
them
even
amazed
but
what
was
on
their
faces
went
no
further
they
looked
and
then
they
went
on
toward
wherever
they
had
been
going
the
air
circulating
in
her
lungs
was
growing
heavier
now
she
crossed
the
canal
feet
pounding
on
cement
while
cars
rumbled
over
the
heavy
wooden
slats
of
the
bridge
to
her
right
to
her
left
she
could
see
the
stone
semicircle
where
the
canal
went
under
the
downtown
area
she
cut
suddenly
across
main
street
oblivious
of
the
honking
horns
and
squealing
brakes
she
went
right
because
the
barrens
lay
in
that
direction
it
was
still
almost
a
mile
away
and
if
she
was
to
get
there
she
would
somehow
have
to
outdistance
her
father
on
the
gruelling
slope
of
upmile
hill
or
one
of
the
even
steeper
sidestreets
but
that
was
all
there
was
come
back
you
little
bitch
i'm
warning
you
as
she
gained
the
sidewalk
on
the
far
side
of
the
street
she
snatched
another
glance
behind
her
the
heavy
weight
of
her
red
hair
shifting
over
her
shoulder
as
she
did
her
father
was
crossing
the
street
as
heedless
of
the
traffic
as
she
had
been
his
face
a
bright
sweaty
red
she
ducked
down
an
alley
that
ran
behind
warehouse
row
this
was
the
rear
of
the
buildings
which
fronted
on
upmile
hill
star
beef
armour
meatpacking
hemphill
storage
warehousing
eagle
beef
kosher
meats
the
alley
was
narrow
and
cobbled
made
narrower
still
by
the
bunches
of
fuming
garbage
cans
and
bins
set
out
here
the
cobbles
were
slimy
with
god
knew
what
offal
and
ordure
there
was
a
mixture
of
smells
some
bland
some
sharp
some
simply
titanic
but
all
spoke
of
meat
and
slaughter
flies
buzzed
in
clouds
from
inside
some
of
the
buildings
she
could
hear
the
bloodcurdling
whine
of
bone
saws
her
feet
stuttered
unevenly
on
the
slick
cobbles
one
hip
struck
a
galvanized
garbage
can
and
packages
of
tripe
wrapped
in
newspaper
fell
out
like
great
meaty
jungle
blossoms
you
get
right
the
hell
back
here
bevvie
i
mean
it
now
don't
make
it
any
worse
than
it
already
is
gir
two
men
lounged
in
the
loading
doorway
of
the
kirshner
packing
works
munching
thick
sandwiches
open
dinnerbuckets
near
at
hand
you
in
a
woeful
place
girl
one
of
them
said
mildly
looks
like
you're
goin
to
the
woodshed
with
your
pa
the
other
laughed
he
was
gaining
she
could
hear
his
thundering
footfalls
and
heavy
respiration
almost
behind
her
now
looking
to
her
right
she
could
see
the
black
wing
of
his
shadow
flying
along
the
high
board
fence
there
then
he
yelled
in
surprise
and
fury
as
his
feet
slipped
out
from
under
him
and
he
thumped
to
the
cobblestones
he
was
up
a
moment
later
no
longer
bellowing
words
but
only
shrieking
out
his
incoherent
fury
while
the
men
in
the
doorway
laughed
and
slapped
each
other
on
the
back
the
alley
zigged
to
the
left
and
beverly
came
to
a
skittering
halt
her
mouth
opening
in
dismay
a
city
dumpster
was
parked
across
the
alley
mouth
there
was
not
even
nine
inches
of
clearance
on
either
side
its
motor
was
idling
under
that
sound
barely
audible
she
could
hear
the
murmur
of
conversation
from
the
dumpsters
cab
more
men
on
lunchbreak
it
lacked
no
more
than
three
or
four
minutes
of
noon
soon
the
courthouse
clock
would
begin
to
chime
the
hour
she
could
hear
him
coming
again
closing
in
she
threw
herself
down
and
hooked
her
way
under
the
dumpster
using
her
elbows
and
wounded
knees
the
stink
of
exhaust
and
diesel
fuel
mixed
with
the
smell
of
ripe
meat
and
made
her
feel
a
kind
of
giddy
nausea
in
a
way
the
ease
of
her
progress
was
worse
she
was
skidding
greasily
over
a
coating
of
slime
and
garbagey
crud
she
kept
moving
once
rising
too
high
off
the
cobbles
so
that
her
back
came
in
contact
with
the
dumpster
hot
exhaustpipe
she
had
to
bite
back
a
scream
beverly
you
under
there
each
word
separated
from
the
last
by
an
outof
breath
gasp
for
air
she
looked
back
and
met
his
eyes
as
he
bent
and
peered
under
the
truck
leave
me
alone
she
managed
you
bitch
he
replied
in
a
thick
spitchoked
voice
he
threw
himself
flat
keys
jingling
and
began
to
crawl
after
her
using
a
grotesque
swimming
stroke
to
pull
himself
along
beverly
clawed
her
way
from
under
the
truck
cab
grabbed
one
of
the
huge
tires
her
fingers
poked
their
way
into
a
tread
up
to
the
second
knuckle
and
yanked
herself
up
she
banged
her
tailbone
on
the
dumpster
front
bumper
and
then
she
was
running
again
heading
up
upmile
hill
now
her
blouse
and
jeans
smeared
with
goop
and
stinking
to
high
heaven
she
looked
back
and
saw
her
father
hands
and
freckled
arms
shoot
out
from
under
the
dumpster
cab
like
the
claws
of
some
imagined
childhood
monster
from
under
the
bed
quickly
hardly
thinking
at
all
she
darted
between
feldman
storage
and
the
tracker
brother
annex
this
covert
too
narrow
to
even
be
called
an
alley
was
filled
with
broken
crates
weeds
sunflowers
and
of
course
more
garbage
beverly
dived
behind
a
pile
of
crates
and
crouched
there
a
few
moments
later
she
saw
her
father
pound
by
the
mouth
of
the
covert
and
on
up
the
hill
beverly
got
up
and
hurried
to
the
far
end
of
the
covert
there
was
a
chainlink
fence
here
she
monkeyed
her
way
to
the
top
got
over
and
worked
her
way
down
the
far
side
she
was
now
on
derry
theological
seminary
property
she
ran
up
the
manicured
back
lawn
and
around
the
side
of
the
building
she
could
hear
someone
inside
playing
something
classical
on
an
organ
the
notes
seemed
to
engrave
their
pleasant
calm
selves
on
the
still
air
there
was
a
tall
hedge
between
the
seminary
and
kansas
street
she
peered
through
it
and
saw
her
father
on
the
far
side
of
the
street
breathing
hard
patches
of
sweat
darkening
his
gray
workshirt
under
the
arms
he
was
peering
around
hands
on
hips
his
keyring
twinkled
brightly
in
the
sun
beverly
watched
him
also
breathing
hard
her
heart
beating
rabbitfast
in
her
throat
she
was
very
thirsty
and
her
simmering
smell
disgusted
her
jf
i
was
drawn
in
a
comicstrip
she
thought
distractedly
there'd
be
all
those
wavy
stinklines
coming
up
from
me
her
father
crossed
slowly
to
the
seminary
side
beverly
breath
stopped
please
god
i
can't
run
anymore
help
me
god
don't
let
him
find
me
al
marsh
walked
slowly
down
the
sidewalk
directly
past
where
his
daughter
crouched
on
the
far
side
of
the
hedge
dear
god
don't
let
him
smell
me
he
didnt
perhaps
because
after
a
tumble
in
the
alleyway
and
crawling
under
the
dumpster
himself
al
smelled
as
bad
as
she
did
he
walked
on
she
watched
him
go
back
down
up
mile
hill
until
he
was
out
of
sight
beverly
picked
herself
up
slowly
her
clothes
were
covered
with
garbage
her
face
was
dirty
her
back
hurt
where
she
had
burnt
it
on
the
exhaustpipe
of
the
dumpster
these
physical
things
pakd
before
the
confused
swirl
of
her
thoughts
she
felt
that
she
had
sailed
off
the
edge
of
the
world
and
none
of
the
normal
patterns
of
behavior
seemed
to
apply
she
could
not
imagine
going
home
but
she
could
not
imagine
not
going
home
she
had
defied
ler
father
defied
him
she
had
to
push
that
thought
away
because
it
made
her
feel
weak
and
trembly
sick
to
her
stomach
she
loved
her
father
wasn't
one
of
the
ten
commandments
honor
thy
mother
and
father
that
thy
days
may
be
long
upon
the
earth
yes
but
he
hadn't
been
himself
hadn't
been
her
father
had
in
fact
been
someone
completely
different
an
imposter
it
suddenly
she
went
cold
as
a
terrible
question
occurred
to
her
was
this
happening
to
the
others
or
something
like
it
she
ought
to
warn
them
they
had
hurt
it
and
perhaps
now
it
was
taking
steps
to
assure
itself
they
would
never
hurt
it
again
and
really
where
else
was
there
to
go
they
were
the
only
friends
she
had
bill
bill
would
know
what
to
do
bill
would
tell
her
what
to
do
bill
would
supply
the
what
next
she
stopped
where
the
seminary
walk
joined
the
kansas
street
sidewalk
and
peered
around
the
hedge
her
father
was
truly
gone
she
turned
right
and
began
to
walk
along
kansas
street
toward
the
barrens
probably
none
of
them
would
be
there
right
now
they
would
be
at
home
eating
their
lunches
but
they
would
be
back
meantime
she
could
go
down
into
the
cool
clubhouse
and
try
to
get
herself
under
some
kind
of
control
she
would
leave
the
little
window
wide
open
so
he
could
have
some
sunshine
and
perhaps
she
would
even
be
able
to
sleep
her
tired
body
and
overstrained
mind
grasped
eagerly
at
the
thought
sleep
yes
that
would
be
good
her
head
drooped
as
she
plodded
past
the
last
bunch
of
houses
before
the
land
grew
too
steep
for
houses
and
plunged
down
into
the
barrens
the
barrens
where
as
incredible
as
it
seemed
to
her
her
father
had
been
lurking
and
spying
she
certainly
did
not
hear
footfalls
behind
her
the
boys
there
were
at
great
pains
to
be
quiet
they
had
been
outrun
before
they
did
not
intend
to
be
outrun
again
they
drew
closer
and
closer
to
her
walking
catsoft
belch
and
victor
were
grinning
but
henry
face
was
both
vacant
and
serious
his
hair
was
uncombed
and
snarly
his
eyes
were
as
unfocused
as
al
marsh
had
been
in
the
apartment
he
held
one
dirty
finger
pressed
over
his
lips
in
a
shhh
gesture
as
they
closed
the
distance
from
seventy
feet
to
fifty
to
thirty
through
that
summer
henry
had
been
edging
steadily
out
over
some
mental
abyss
walking
on
a
bridge
that
had
grown
relentlessly
more
and
more
narrow
on
the
day
when
he
had
allowed
patrick
hockstetter
to
caress
him
that
bridge
had
narrowed
to
a
tightrope
the
tightrope
had
snapped
this
morning
he
had
gone
out
into
the
yard
naked
except
for
his
ragged
yellowing
undershorts
and
looked
up
into
the
sky
the
ghost
of
last
night
moon
still
lingered
there
and
as
he
looked
at
it
the
moon
had
suddenly
changed
into
a
skeletal
grinning
face
henry
had
fallen
on
his
knees
before
this
face
exalted
with
terror
and
joy
ghostvoices
came
from
the
moon
the
voices
changed
sometimes
seemed
to
merge
together
in
a
soft
babble
that
was
barely
understandable
but
he
sensed
the
truth
which
was
simply
that
all
these
voices
were
one
voice
one
intelligence
the
voice
told
him
to
hunt
up
belch
and
victor
and
be
at
the
comer
of
kansas
street
and
costello
avenue
around
noon
the
voice
told
him
he
would
know
what
to
do
then
sure
enough
the
cunt
had
come
bopping
along
he
waited
to
hear
what
the
voice
would
tell
him
to
do
next
the
answer
came
as
they
continued
to
close
the
distance
the
voice
came
not
from
the
moon
but
from
the
sewergrating
they
were
passing
the
voice
was
low
but
clear
belch
and
victor
glanced
toward
the
grating
in
a
dazed
almost
hypnotized
way
then
back
at
beverly
kill
her
the
voice
from
the
sewer
said
henry
bowers
reached
into
the
pocket
of
his
jeans
and
brought
out
a
slim
nineinchlong
instrument
with
imitationivory
inlays
along
its
sides
a
small
chromium
button
glittered
at
one
end
of
this
dubious
objet
d'art
henry
pushed
it
a
sixinch
blade
popped
out
of
the
slit
at
the
end
of
the
handle
he
bounced
the
switchblade
on
his
palm
he
began
to
walk
a
little
faster
victor
and
belch
still
looking
dazed
increased
their
own
walking
speed
to
keep
up
with
him
beverly
did
not
hear
them
precisely
that
was
not
what
made
her
turn
her
head
as
henry
bowers
closed
the
distance
bentkneed
shuffling
a
frozen
grin
on
his
face
henry
was
as
silent
as
an
indian
no
it
was
simply
a
feeling
too
clear
and
direct
and
powerful
to
be
denied
of
the
derry
public
library
a.m
being
watched
mike
hanlon
laid
his
pen
aside
and
looked
across
the
shadowy
inverted
bowl
of
the
library
main
room
he
saw
islands
of
light
thrown
by
the
hanging
globes
he
saw
books
fading
into
dimness
he
saw
the
iron
staircases
making
their
graceful
trellised
spirals
up
to
the
stacks
he
saw
nothing
out
of
place
all
the
same
he
did
not
believe
he
was
alone
in
here
not
anymore
after
the
others
were
gone
mike
had
cleaned
up
with
a
care
that
was
only
habit
he
was
on
autopilot
his
mind
a
million
miles
and
twentyseven
years
away
he
dumped
ashtrays
threw
away
the
empty
liquor
bottles
putting
a
layer
of
waste
over
them
so
that
carole
wouldn't
be
shocked
and
the
returnable
cans
in
a
box
behind
his
desk
then
he
got
the
broom
and
swept
up
the
remains
of
the
gin
bottle
eddie
had
broken
when
the
table
was
clean
he
had
gone
into
the
periodicals
room
and
picked
up
the
scattered
magazines
as
he
did
these
simple
chores
his
mind
sifted
the
stories
they
had
told
concentrating
the
most
perhaps
on
what
they
had
left
out
they
believed
they
remembered
everything
he
thought
that
bill
and
beverly
almost
did
but
there
was
more
it
would
come
to
them
if
it
allowed
them
the
time
in
there
had
been
no
chance
for
preparation
they
had
talked
endlessly
their
talk
interrupted
only
by
the
rockfight
and
that
one
act
of
group
heroism
at
neibolt
street
and
might
in
the
end
have
done
no
more
than
talk
then
august
th
had
come
and
henry
and
his
friends
had
simply
chased
them
into
the
sewers
maybe
i
should
have
told
them
he
thought
putting
the
last
of
the
magazines
back
in
their
places
but
something
spoke
strongly
against
the
idea
the
voice
of
the
turtle
he
supposed
perhaps
that
was
part
of
it
and
perhaps
that
sense
of
circularity
was
part
of
it
too
maybe
that
last
act
was
going
to
repeat
itself
in
some
updated
fashion
as
well
he
had
put
flashlights
and
miner
helmets
carefully
by
against
tomorrow
he
had
the
blueprints
of
the
derry
sewer
and
drain
systems
neatly
rolled
up
and
held
with
rubber
bands
in
that
same
closet
but
when
they
were
kids
all
their
talk
and
all
their
plans
half
baked
or
otherwise
had
come
to
nothing
in
the
end
in
the
end
they
had
simply
been
chased
into
the
drains
hurled
into
the
confrontation
which
had
followed
was
that
going
to
happen
again
faith
and
power
he
had
come
to
believe
were
interchangeable
was
the
final
truth
even
simpler
that
no
act
of
faith
was
possible
until
you
were
rudly
pushed
out
into
the
screaming
middle
of
things
like
a
newborn
child
skydiving
chutelessly
out
of
his
mother
womb
once
you
were
falling
you
were
forced
to
believe
in
the
chute
into
existence
weren't
you
pulling
the
ring
as
you
fell
became
your
final
statement
on
the
subject
one
way
or
the
other
jesus
christ
it
fulton
sheen
in
blackface
mike
thought
and
laughed
a
little
mike
cleaned
neatened
thought
his
thoughts
while
another
part
of
his
brain
expected
that
he
would
finish
and
finally
find
himself
tired
enough
to
go
home
and
sleep
for
a
few
hours
but
when
he
finally
did
finish
he
found
himself
as
wide
awake
as
ever
so
he
had
gone
to
the
single
closed
stack
behind
his
office
unlocking
the
wire
gate
with
a
key
from
his
ring
and
letting
himself
in
this
stack
supposedly
fireproof
when
the
vaulttype
door
was
closed
and
locked
contained
the
library
valuable
first
editions
books
signed
by
writers
long
since
dead
among
the
signed
editions
were
moby
dick
and
whitman
leaves
of
grass
historical
matter
relating
to
the
town
and
the
personal
papers
of
the
few
writers
who
had
lived
and
worked
in
derry
mike
hoped
if
all
of
this
ended
well
to
persuade
bill
to
leave
his
manuscripts
to
the
derry
public
library
walking
down
the
third
aisle
of
the
stack
beneath
tin
shaded
lightbulbs
smelling
the
familiar
library
scents
of
must
and
dust
and
cinnimony
ageing
paper
he
thought
when
i
die
i
guess
i'll
go
with
a
library
card
in
one
hand
and
an
overdue
stamp
in
the
other
well
maybe
that
better
than
dying
with
a
gun
in
your
hand
nigger
he
stopped
halfway
down
this
third
aisle
his
dogeared
steno
notebook
which
contained
the
jotted
tales
of
derry
and
his
own
troubled
wanderings
was
tucked
between
fricke
old
derrytown
and
michaud
history
of
derry
he
had
pushed
the
notebook
so
far
back
it
was
nearly
invisible
no
one
would
stumble
across
it
unless
they
were
looking
for
it
mike
took
it
and
went
back
to
the
table
where
they
had
held
their
meeting
pausing
to
turn
off
the
lights
in
the
closed
stack
and
to
relock
the
wire
mesh
he
sat
down
and
flipped
through
the
pages
he
had
written
thinking
what
a
strange
crippled
affidavit
he
had
ceated
halfhistory
halfscandal
part
diary
part
confessional
he
had
not
entered
since
april
th
have
to
get
a
new
book
soon
he
thought
thumbing
the
few
blank
pages
that
were
left
he
thought
bemusedly
for
a
moment
of
margaret
mitchell
first
draf
of
gone
with
the
wind
written
in
longhand
in
stacks
and
stacks
and
stacks
of
school
composition
books
then
he
uncapped
his
pen
and
wrote
may
st
two
lines
below
the
end
of
his
last
entry
he
paused
looking
vaguely
across
the
empty
library
and
then
began
to
write
about
everything
that
had
happened
during
the
last
three
days
beginning
with
his
telephone
call
to
stanley
uris
he
wrote
carefully
for
fifteen
minutes
and
then
his
concentration
began
to
come
unravelled
he
paused
more
and
more
frequertly
the
image
of
stan
uris
severed
head
in
the
refrigerator
tried
to
intrude
stan
bloody
head
the
mouth
open
and
full
of
feathers
falling
out
of
the
refrigerator
and
rolling
across
the
floor
toward
him
he
banished
it
with
an
effort
and
went
on
writing
five
minutes
later
he
jerked
upright
and
whirled
around
convinced
he
would
see
that
head
rolling
across
the
old
black
and
red
tiles
of
the
main
floor
eyes
as
glassy
and
avid
as
the
eyes
in
the
mounted
head
of
a
deer
there
was
nothing
no
head
no
sound
except
the
muffled
drum
of
his
own
heart
got
to
get
ahold
of
yourself
mikey
it
the
jimjams
that
all
nothing
else
to
it
but
it
was
no
use
the
words
began
to
get
away
from
him
the
thoughts
seemed
to
dangle
just
out
of
reach
there
was
a
pressure
on
the
back
of
his
neck
and
it
seemed
to
grow
heavier
being
watched
he
put
his
pen
down
and
got
up
from
the
table
is
anyone
here
he
called
and
his
voice
echoed
back
from
the
rotunda
giving
him
a
jolt
he
licked
his
lips
and
tried
again
bill
ben
billillill
benenen
suddenly
mike
decided
he
wanted
to
be
home
he
would
simply
take
the
notebook
with
him
he
reached
for
it
and
heard
a
faint
sliding
footstep
he
looked
up
again
pools
of
light
surrounded
by
deepening
lagoons
of
shadow
nothing
else
at
least
nothing
he
could
see
he
waited
heart
beating
hard
the
footstep
came
again
and
this
time
he
pinpointed
the
location
the
glassedin
passageway
that
connected
the
adult
library
to
the
children
library
in
there
someone
something
moving
quietly
mike
walked
across
to
the
checkout
desk
the
double
doors
leading
into
the
passageway
were
held
open
by
wooden
chocks
and
he
could
see
a
little
way
in
he
could
see
what
looked
like
feet
and
with
sudden
swooning
horror
he
wondered
if
maybe
stan
had
come
after
all
if
maybe
stan
was
going
to
step
out
of
the
shadows
with
his
bird
encyclopedia
in
one
hand
his
face
white
his
lips
purple
his
wrists
and
forearms
cut
open
i
finally
came
stan
would
say
it
took
me
awhile
because
i
had
to
pull
myself
out
of
a
hole
in
the
ground
but
i
finally
came
there
was
another
footstep
and
now
mike
could
see
shoes
for
sure
shoes
and
ragged
pantslegs
denim
with
strings
hanging
down
against
sockless
ankles
and
in
the
darkness
almost
six
feet
above
those
ankles
he
could
see
glittering
eyes
he
groped
over
the
surface
of
the
semicircular
checkout
desk
and
felt
along
the
other
side
without
taking
his
gaze
from
those
moveless
glittering
eyes
his
fingers
felt
one
wooden
comer
of
a
small
box
the
overdue
cards
a
paper
box
paper
clips
and
rubber
bands
they
happened
on
something
that
was
metal
and
seized
it
it
was
a
letteropener
with
the
words
jesus
saves
stamped
on
the
handle
a
flimsy
thing
that
had
come
in
the
mail
from
the
grace
baptist
church
as
part
of
a
fundraising
drive
mike
had
not
attended
services
in
fifteen
years
but
grace
baptist
had
been
his
mother
church
and
he
had
sent
them
five
dollars
he
could
not
really
afford
he
had
meant
to
throw
the
letteropener
out
but
it
had
stayed
here
amid
the
clutter
on
his
side
of
the
desk
carole
side
was
always
spotlessly
clean
until
now
he
clutched
it
with
feverish
strength
and
stared
into
the
shadowy
hallway
there
was
another
step
another
now
the
ragged
denim
pants
were
visible
up
to
the
knees
he
could
see
the
shape
these
lower
legs
belonged
to
it
was
big
hulking
the
shoulders
were
rounded
there
was
a
suggestion
of
ragged
hair
the
figure
was
apelike
who
are
you
there
was
no
answer
the
shape
merely
stood
there
contemplating
him
although
still
afraid
mike
had
gotten
over
the
debilitating
idea
that
it
might
be
stan
unis
returned
from
the
grave
called
back
by
the
scars
on
his
palms
some
eldritch
magnetism
which
had
brought
him
back
like
a
zombie
in
a
hammer
horror
film
whoever
this
was
it
wasn't
stan
uris
who
had
finished
at
five
seven
when
he
had
his
full
growth
the
shape
took
another
step
and
now
the
light
from
the
globe
closest
to
the
passageway
fell
across
the
beltless
loops
of
the
jeans
around
the
shape
waist
suddenly
mike
knew
even
before
the
shape
spoke
he
knew
why
it
the
nigger
the
shape
said
been
throwing
rocks
at
anyone
nigger
want
to
know
who
poisoned
your
fucking
dog
the
shape
stepped
forward
the
light
fell
on
the
face
of
henry
bowers
it
had
grown
fat
and
sagging
the
skin
had
an
unhealthy
tallowy
hue
the
cheeks
had
become
hanging
jowls
that
were
specked
with
stubble
almost
as
much
white
in
that
stubble
as
black
wavy
lines
three
of
them
were
engraved
in
the
shelf
of
the
forehead
above
the
bushy
brows
other
lines
formed
parentheses
at
the
corners
of
the
fulllipped
mouth
the
eyes
were
small
and
mean
inside
discolored
pouches
of
flesh
bloodshot
and
thoughtless
it
was
the
face
of
a
man
being
pushed
into
a
premature
age
a
man
who
was
thirtynine
going
on
seventythree
but
it
was
also
the
face
of
a
twelveyearold
boy
henry
clothes
were
still
green
with
whatever
bushes
he
had
spent
the
day
hiding
in
ain't
you
ganna
say
howdy
nigger
henry
asked
hellow
henry
it
occurred
to
him
dimly
that
he
had
not
listened
to
the
radio
for
the
last
two
days
and
he
had
not
even
read
the
paper
which
was
a
ritual
with
him
too
much
going
on
too
busy
too
bad
henry
emerged
from
the
corridor
between
the
children
library
and
the
adult
library
and
stood
there
peering
at
mike
with
his
piggy
little
eyes
his
lips
parted
in
an
unspeakable
grin
revealing
rotted
backmaine
teeth
voices
he
said
you
hear
voices
nigger
which
voices
are
those
henry
he
put
both
hands
behind
his
back
like
a
schoolboy
called
upon
to
recite
and
transferred
the
letteropener
from
his
left
hand
to
his
right
the
grandfather
clock
given
by
horst
mueller
in
ticked
solemn
seconds
into
the
smooth
pond
of
library
silence
from
the
moon
henry
said
he
put
a
hand
in
his
pocket
came
from
the
moon
lots
of
voices
he
paused
frowned
slightly
then
shook
his
head
lots
but
really
only
one
it
voice
did
you
see
it
henry
ye
henry
said
frankenstein
tore
off
victor
head
you
should
have
heard
it
made
a
sound
like
a
great
big
zipper
going
down
then
it
went
after
belch
belch
fought
it
did
he
yep
that
how
i
got
away
you
left
him
to
die
don't
you
say
that
henry
cheeks
flushed
a
dull
red
he
took
two
steps
forward
the
farther
he
walked
from
the
umbilicus
connecting
the
children
library
to
the
adult
library
the
younger
he
looked
to
mike
he
saw
the
same
old
meanness
in
henry
face
but
he
saw
something
else
as
well
the
child
who
had
been
brought
up
by
crazy
butch
bowers
on
a
good
farm
that
had
gone
to
shitshack
shambles
over
the
years
don't
you
say
that
it
would
have
killed
me
too
tt
didn't
kill
us
henry
eyes
gleamed
with
rancid
humor
not
yet
but
it
will
less
i
don't
leave
any
of
you
for
it
to
get
he
pulled
his
hand
out
of
his
pocket
in
it
was
a
slim
nineinchlong
instrument
with
imitationivory
inlay
along
its
sides
a
small
chromium
button
glittered
at
one
end
of
this
dubious
objet
d'art
henry
pushed
it
a
sixinch
steel
blade
popped
out
of
the
slit
at
the
end
of
the
handle
he
bounced
the
switchblade
on
his
palm
and
began
to
valk
toward
the
checkout
desk
a
little
faster
look
what
i
found
he
said
i
knew
where
to
look
obscenely
one
redrimmed
eyelid
drooped
in
a
wink
the
man
in
the
moon
told
me
henry
revealed
his
teeth
again
hid
today
hitchhiked
a
ride
tonight
old
man
hit
him
killed
him
i
think
ditched
the
car
over
in
newport
just
over
the
derry
town
line
i
heard
that
voice
i
looked
in
a
drain
there
was
these
clothes
and
the
knife
my
old
knife
youre
forgetting
something
henry
henry
grinning
only
shook
his
head
we
got
away
and
you
got
away
if
it
wants
us
it
wants
you
too
no
i
think
yes
maybe
you
yoyos
did
its
work
but
it
didn't
exactly
play
favorites
did
it
it
got
both
of
your
friends
and
while
belch
was
fighting
it
you
got
away
but
now
you're
back
i
think
you're
part
of
its
unfinished
business
henry
i
really
do
no
maybe
frankenstein
what
you'll
see
or
the
werewolf
a
vampire
the
clown
or
henry
maybe
you'll
really
see
what
it
looks
like
henry
we
did
want
me
to
tell
you
want
me
to
you
shut
up
henry
screamed
and
launched
himself
at
mike
mike
stepped
aside
and
stuck
out
one
foot
henry
tripped
over
it
and
went
skidding
over
the
footworm
tiles
like
a
shuffleboard
weight
his
head
struck
a
leg
of
the
table
where
the
losers
had
sat
earlier
that
night
telling
their
tales
for
a
moment
he
was
stunned
the
knife
hung
loose
in
his
hand
mike
went
after
him
went
after
the
knife
in
that
moment
he
could
have
finished
henry
it
would
have
been
possible
to
have
planted
the
jesus
saves
letteropener
which
had
come
in
the
mail
from
his
mother
old
church
in
the
back
of
henry
neck
and
then
called
the
police
there
would
have
been
a
certain
amount
of
official
nonsense
but
not
too
much
of
it
not
in
derry
where
such
weird
and
violent
events
were
not
entirely
exceptional
what
stopped
him
was
a
realization
almost
too
lightninglike
to
be
conscious
that
if
he
killed
henry
he
would
be
doing
its
work
as
surely
as
henry
would
be
doing
its
work
by
killing
mike
and
something
else
that
other
look
he
had
seen
on
henry
face
the
tired
bewildered
look
of
the
badly
used
child
who
has
been
set
on
a
poisonous
path
for
some
unknown
purpose
henry
had
grown
up
within
the
contaminated
radius
of
butch
bowers
mind
surely
he
had
belonged
to
it
even
before
he
suspected
it
existed
so
instead
of
planting
the
letteropener
in
henry
vulnerable
neck
he
dropped
to
his
knees
and
snatched
at
the
knife
it
twisted
in
his
hand
seemingly
of
its
own
volition
and
his
ringers
closed
on
the
blade
there
was
no
immediate
pain
only
red
blood
flowing
down
the
first
three
fingers
of
his
right
hand
and
into
his
scarred
palm
he
pulled
back
henry
rolled
away
and
grabbed
the
knife
again
mike
got
to
his
knees
and
the
two
of
them
faced
each
other
that
way
each
bleeding
mike
fingers
henry
nose
henry
shook
his
head
and
droplets
flew
away
into
the
darkness
thought
you
were
so
smart
he
cried
hoarsely
fucking
sissies
is
all
you
were
we
could
have
beat
you
in
a
fair
fight
put
the
knife
down
henry
mike
said
quietly
ti
call
the
police
they'll
come
and
get
you
and
take
you
back
to
juniper
hill
you'll
be
out
of
derry
you'll
be
safe
henry
tried
to
talk
and
couldn't
he
couldn't
tell
this
hateful
jig
that
he
wouldn't
be
safe
in
juniper
hill
or
los
angeles
or
the
rainforests
of
timbuktu
sooner
or
later
the
moon
would
rise
bonewhite
and
snowcold
and
the
ghostvoices
would
start
and
the
face
of
the
moon
would
change
into
its
face
babbling
and
laughing
and
ordering
he
swallowed
slickslimy
blood
you
never
fought
fair
did
you
mike
asked
you
niggerboogienightfighterjunglebunnyapemancoo
henry
screamed
and
leaped
at
mike
again
mike
leaned
back
to
avoid
his
blundering
awkward
rush
overbalanced
and
went
sprawling
on
his
back
henry
struck
the
table
again
rebounded
turned
and
clutched
mike
arm
mike
swept
the
letteropener
around
and
felt
it
go
deep
into
henry
forearm
henry
screamed
but
instead
of
letting
go
he
tightened
his
grip
he
pulled
himself
toward
mike
his
hair
in
his
eyes
blood
flowing
from
his
ruptured
nose
over
his
thick
lips
mike
tried
to
get
a
foot
in
henry
side
and
push
him
away
henry
swung
the
switchblade
in
a
glittering
arc
and
all
six
inches
of
it
went
into
mike
thigh
it
went
in
effortlessly
as
if
into
a
warm
cake
of
butter
henry
pulled
it
out
dripping
and
with
a
scream
of
combined
pain
and
effort
mike
shoved
him
away
he
struggled
to
his
feet
but
henry
was
up
more
quickly
and
mike
was
barely
able
to
avoid
henry
next
blundering
rush
he
could
feel
blood
pouring
down
his
leg
in
an
alarming
flood
filling
his
loafer
he
got
my
femoral
artery
i
think
jesus
he
got
me
bad
blood
everywhere
blood
on
the
floor
shoes
won't
be
any
good
shit
just
bought
them
two
months
ago
henry
came
again
panting
and
puffing
like
a
bull
in
heat
mike
staggered
aside
and
swept
the
letteropener
at
him
again
it
tore
through
henry
ragged
shirt
and
pulled
a
deep
cut
across
his
ribs
henry
grunted
as
mike
shoved
him
away
again
you
dirtyfighting
nigge
he
wailed
look
what
you
done
drop
the
knife
henry
mike
said
there
was
a
titter
from
behind
them
henry
looked
and
then
screamed
in
utter
horror
clapping
his
hands
to
his
cheeks
like
an
offended
old
maid
mike
gaze
jerked
toward
the
circulation
desk
there
was
a
loud
vibrating
kaspanggg
sound
and
stan
uris
head
popped
up
from
behind
the
desk
a
spring
corkscrewed
up
and
into
his
severed
dripping
neck
his
face
was
livid
with
greasepaint
there
was
a
fever
spot
of
rouge
on
each
cheek
great
orange
pompoms
flowered
where
the
eyes
had
been
this
grotesque
stan
inthebox
head
nodded
back
and
forth
at
the
end
of
its
spring
like
one
of
the
giant
sunflowers
beside
the
house
on
neibolt
street
its
mouth
opened
and
a
squealing
laughing
voice
began
to

mike
wheeled
back
toward
henry
dismally
aware
that
he
had
been
tricked
wondering
faintly
whose
face
henry
had
seen
at
the
end
of
that
spring
stan
victor
criss
his
father
perhaps
henry
shrieked
and
rushed
at
mike
the
switchblade
plunging
up
and
down
like
the
needle
of
a
sewing
machine
gaaaah
nigge
henry
was
screaming
gaaaah
nigger
gaaaah
nigger
mike
backpedaled
and
the
leg
henry
had
stabbed
buckled
under
him
almost
at
once
spilling
him
to
the
floor
there
was
hardly
any
feeling
at
all
left
in
that
èg
it
felt
cold
and
distant
looking
down
he
saw
that
his
creamcolored
slacks
were
now
bright
red
henry
blade
flashed
by
in
front
of
his
nose
mike
stabbed
out
with
the
jesus
saves
letteropener
as
henry
turned
back
for
another
go
henry
ran
into
it
like
a
bug
onto
a
phi
warm
blood
doused
mike
hand
there
was
a
snap
and
when
he
drew
his
hand
back
he
only
had
the
haft
of
the
letteropener
the
blade
was
in
henry
stomach
gaaah
nigger
henry
screamed
clapping
a
hand
over
the
protruding
jag
of
blade
blood
poured
through
his
fingers
he
looked
at
it
with
bulging
unbelieving
eyes
the
head
of
the
end
of
the
creaking
dipping
jackinthebox
squealed
and
laughed
mike
feeling
sick
and
dizzy
now
looked
back
at
it
and
saw
belch
huggin
head
a
human
champagne
cork
wearing
a
new
york
yankees
baseball
cap
turned
backward
he
groaned
aloud
and
the
sound
was
far
away
echoey
in
his
own
ears
he
was
aware
that
he
was
sitting
in
a
pool
of
warm
blood
his
own
if
i
don't
get
a
tourniquet
on
my
leg
i'm
going
to
die
gaaaaaaaaaah
neeeeeeegaaa
henry
screamed
still
holding
his
bleeding
belly
with
one
hand
and
the
switchblade
with
the
other
he
staggered
away
from
mike
and
toward
the
library
doors
he
wove
drunkenly
from
side
to
side
progressing
across
the
echoing
main
room
like
a
pinball
in
an
electronic
game
he
struck
one
of
the
easychairs
and
knocked
it
over
his
groping
hand
spilled
a
rack
of
newspapers
onto
the
floor
he
reached
the
doors
straightarmed
one
of
them
and
plunged
out
into
the
night
mike
consciousness
was
fading
now
he
worked
at
the
buckle
of
his
belt
with
fingers
he
could
barely
feel
at
last
he
got
it
unhooked
and
managed
to
pull
it
free
of
its
loops
he
put
it
around
his
bleeding
leg
just
below
he
groin
and
cinched
it
tight
holding
it
with
one
hand
he
began
to
crawl
toward
the
circulation
desk
the
phone
was
there
he
wasn't
sure
how
he
was
going
to
reach
it
but
for
now
that
didn't
matter
the
trick
was
just
to
get
there
the
world
wavered
bhlirred
grew
faint
behind
waves
of
gray
he
stuck
his
tongue
out
and
bit
down
on
it
savagely
the
pain
was
immediate
and
exquisite
the
world
swam
back
into
focus
he
became
aware
that
he
was
still
holding
the
ragged
haft
of
the
letteropener
and
he
tossed
it
away
here
at
last
was
the
circulation
desk
looking
as
tall
as
everest
mike
got
his
good
leg
under
him
and
pushed
himself
up
clutching
at
the
edge
of
the
desk
with
the
hand
that
wasn't
holding
the
belt
tight
his
mouth
was
drawn
down
in
a
trenbling
grimace
his
eyes
slitted
at
last
he
managed
to
get
all
the
way
up
he
stood
there
storklike
and
groped
the
telephone
over
to
him
taped
to
the
side
were
three
numbers
fire
police
and
hospital
with
one
shaking
finger
that
looked
at
least
ten
miles
away
mike
dialed
the
hospital
he
closed
his
eyes
as
the
phone
began
to
ring
and
then
they
opened
wide
as
the
voice
of
pennywise
the
clown
answered
howdy
nigger
pennywise
cried
and
then
screamed
laughter
as
sharp
as
broken
ghss
into
mike
ear

hello

mike
eyes
turned
up
to
the
face
of
the
grandfather
clock
the
mueller
clock
it
was
called
and
saw
with
no
surprise
at
ail
that
the
clockface
had
been
replaced
with
his
father
face
gray
and
raddled
with
cancer
the
eyes
were
turned
up
to
show
only
bulging
whites
suddenly
his
father
popped
his
tongue
out
and
the
clock
began
to
strike
mike
lost
his
grip
on
the
circulation
desk
he
swayed
for
a
moment
on
his
good
leg
and
then
he
fell
down
again
the
phone
swung
before
him
at
the
end
of
its
cord
like
a
mesmerist
amulet
it
was
becoming
very
hard
to
hold
onto
the
belt
now

he
lay
on
his
side
drawing
his
legs
up
until
he
was
in
a
fetal
position
he
took
two
turns
around
his
right
hand
with
the
belt
and
concentrated
on
holding
it
as
the
world
drifted
away
in
those
cottony
balloon
like
clouds
of
gray
hello

from
the
dangling
swinging

instantly
turning
to
run
it
was
a
quicker
reaction
than
any
of
them
had
expected
and
she
might
actually
have
gotten
a
running
start
but
for
her
hair
henry
snatched
at
it
caught
part
of
its
long
flow
and
pulled
her
back
he
grinned
into
her
face
his
breath
was
thick
and
warm
and
stinking
howyadoon
henry
bowers
asked
her

that
she
struggled
to
get
free
henry
laughed
and
shook
her
head
back
and
forth
by
the
hair
the
knife
flashed
dangerously
in
the
hazy
august
sunshine
abruptly
a
car
horn
honked
a
long
blast
here
here
what
are
you
boys
doing
let
that
girl
g
it
was
an
old
lady
behind
the
wheel
of
a
wellpreserved
ford
she
had
pulled
up
to
the
curb
and
was
leaning
across
the
blanketcovered
seat
to
peer
out
the
passengerside
window
at
the
sight
of
her
angry
honest
face
the
blank
dazed
look
left
victor
criss
eyes
for
the
first
time
and
he
looked
nervously
at
henry
what
please
bev
cried
shrilly
he
got
a
knife
a
knife
the
old
lady
anger
now
became
concern
surprise
and
fear
as
well
what
are
you
boys
doing
let
her
alone
across
the
street
bev
saw
this
quite
clearly
herbert
ross
got
out
of
the
lawnchair
on
his
porch
approached
the
porch
rail
and
looked
over
his
face
was
as
blank
as
belch
huggins
he
folded
his
paper
turned
and
went
quietly
into
the
house
let
her
be
the
old
lady
cried
shrilly
henry
bared
his
teeth
and
suddenly
ran
at
her
car
dragging
beverly
after
him
by
the
hair
she
stumbled
went
to
one
knee
was
dragged
the
pain
in
her
scalp
was
excruciating
monstrous
she
felt
some
of
her
hair
rip
out
the
old
lady
screamed
and
cranked
the
passenger
side
window
frantically
henry
still
roaring
stabbed
down
and
the
switchblade
skated
across
glass
the
woman
foot
came
off
the
old
ford
clutchpedal
and
it
went
down
kansas
street
in
three
big
jerks
bouncing
up
over
the
curb
where
it
stalled
henry
went
after
it
still
pulling
beverly
along
victor
licked
his
lips
and
looked
around
belch
pushed
the
new
york
yankees
baseball
cap
he
was
wearing
up
on
his
forehead
and
then
dug
at
his
ear
in
a
puzzled
gesture
bev
saw
the
old
woman
white
frightened
face
for
one
moment
and
then
saw
her
pawing
at
the
doorlocks
first
on
the
passenger
side
then
on
her
own
the
ford
engine
ground
and
caught
henry
lifted
one
booted
foot
and
kicked
out
a
taillight
get
outta
here
you
dried
up
old
bitch
the
tires
screamed
as
the
old
lady
pulled
back
out
in
the
street
an
oncoming
pickup
truck
swerved
to
avoid
her
its
horn
blasted
henry
turned
back
toward
bev
beginning
to
smile
again
and
she
hiked
one
sneakered
foot
directly
into
his
balls
the
smile
on
henry
face
turned
into
a
grimace
of
agony
the
switchknife
dropped
from
his
hand
and
clattered
onto
the
sidewalk
his
other
hand
left
its
nestingplace
in
the
tangle
of
her
hair
pulling
once
more
terribly
as
it
went
and
then
he
sank
to
his
knees
trying
to
scream
holding
his
crotch
she
could
see
strands
of
her
own
coppery
hair
on
one
hand
and
in
that
instant
all
of
her
terror
turned
to
bright
hate
she
drew
in
a
great
hitching
breath
and
hocked
a
remarkably
large
looey
onto
the
top
of
his
head
then
she
turned
and
ran
belch
lumbered
three
steps
after
her
and
then
stopped
he
and
victor
went
to
henry
who
threw
them
aside
and
then
staggered
to
his
feet
both
hands
still
cupping
his
balls
it
was
not
the
first
time
that
summer
that
he
had
been
kicked
there
he
leaned
over
and
picked
up
the
switchblade
o
he
wheezed
what
henry
belch
said
anxiously
henry
turned
a
face
toward
him
that
was
so
full
of
sweating
pain
and
sick
blazing
hate
that
belch
fell
back
a
step
i
sail
come
o
he
managed
and
began
to
stagger
and
lurch
up
the
street
after
beverly
holding
his
crotch
we
can't
catch
her
now
henry
victor
said
uneasily
hell
you
can
hardly
walk
we'll
catch
he
henry
panted
his
upper
lip
was
rising
and
falling
in
an
unconscious
dog
like
sneer
beads
of
sweat
stood
out
on
his
forehead
and
ran
down
his
hectic
cheeks
we'll
catch
her
all
right
because
i
know
where
she
going
she
going
down
into
the
barrens
to
be
with
her
asshole
the
derry
town
house
/
a.m
friends
beverly
said
hmmm
bill
looked
at
her
his
thoughts
had
been
far
away
they
had
been
walking
hand
inhand
the
silence
between
them
companionable
slightly
charged
with
mutual
attraction
he
had
caught
mly
the
last
word
of
what
she
had
said
a
block
ahead
the
lights
of
the
town
house
shone
through
the
low
groundfog
said
you
were
my
best
friends
the
only
friends
i
ever
had
back
then
she
smiled
making
friends
has
never
been
my
strong
suit
i
guess
although
i've
got
a
good
one
back
in
chicago
a
woman
named
kay
mccall
i
think
you'd
like
her
bill
probably
would
i've
never
been
real
fast
to
make
friends
myself
he
smiled
back
then
we
were
all
we
nuhnuhneeded
he
saw
beads
of
noisture
in
her
hair
appreciated
the
way
the
lights
made
a
nimbus
about
her
head
her
eyes
were
turned
gravely
up
to
his
i
need
something
now
she
said
w
what
that
need
you
to
kiss
m
she
said
he
thought
of
audra
and
for
the
first
time
it
occurred
to
him
that
she
looked
like
beverly
he
wondered
if
maybe
that
had
been
the
attraction
all
along
the
reason
he
had
been
able
to
find
guts
enough
to
ask
audra
out
near
the
end
of
the
hollywood
party
where
they
had
been
introduced
he
felt
a
pang
of
unhappy
guilt
and
then
he
took
beverly
his
childhood
friend
in
his
arms
her
kiss
was
firm
and
warm
and
sweet
her
breasts
pushed
against
his
open
coat
and
her
hips
moved
against
him
away
and
then
against
him
again
when
her
hips
moved
away
a
second
tune
he
plunged
both
of
his
hands
into
her
hair
and
moved
against
her
when
she
felt
him
growing
hard
she
uttered
a
little
gasp
and
put
her
face
against
the
side
of
his
neck
he
felt
her
tears
on
his
skin
warm
and
secret
come
on
she
said
quick
he
took
her
hand
and
they
walked
the
rest
of
the
way
to
the
town
house
the
lobby
was
old
festooned
with
plants
and
still
possessed
of
a
certain
fading
charm
the
decor
was
very
much
nineteenth
century
lumberman
it
was
deserted
at
this
hour
except
for
the
desk
clerk
who
could
be
dimly
seen
in
the
inner
office
his
feet
cocked
up
on
the
desk
watching
tv
bill
pushed
the
thirdfloor
button
with
a
finger
that
trembled
just
slightly
excitement
nervousness
guilt
all
of
the
above
oh
yeah
sure
and
a
kind
of
almost
insane
joy
and
fear
as
well
these
feelings
did
not
mix
pleasantly
but
they
seemed
necessary
he
led
her
down
the
hallway
toward
his
room
deciding
in
some
confused
way
that
if
he
were
to
be
unfaithful
it
should
be
a
complete
act
of
infidelity
consummated
in
his
place
not
hers
he
found
himself
thinking
of
susan
browne
his
first
bookagent
and
at
the
age
of
not
quite
twenty
his
first
lover
cheating
cheating
on
my
wife
he
tried
to
get
this
through
his
head
but
it
seemed
both
real
and
unreal
at
the
same
time
what
seemed
strongest
was
an
unhappy
sense
of
homesickness
an
oldfashioned
feeling
of
falling
away
audra
would
be
up
by
now
making
coffee
sitting
at
the
kitchen
table
in
her
robe
perhaps
studying
lines
perhaps
reading
a
dick
francis
novel
his
key
rattled
in
the
lock
of
room
if
they
had
gone
to
beverly
room
on
the
fifth
floor
they
would
have
seen
the
messagelight
on
her
phone
blinking
the
tvwatching
desk
clerk
would
have
given
her
a
message
to
call
her
friend
kay
in
chicago
after
kay
third
frantic
call
he
had
finally
remembered
to
post
the
message
things
might
have
taken
a
different
course
the
five
of
them
might
not
have
been
fugitives
from
the
derry
police
when
that
day
light
finally
broke
but
they
went
to
his
as
things
had
perhaps
been
arranged
the
door
opened
they
were
inside
she
looked
at
him
eyes
bright
cheeks
flushed
her
breast
rising
and
falling
rapidly
he
took
her
in
his
arms
and
was
overwhelmed
by
the
feeling
of
rightness
the
feeling
of
the
circle
between
past
and
present
closing
with
a
triumphant
seamlessness
he
kicked
the
door
shut
clumsily
with
one
foot
and
she
laughed
her
warm
breath
into
his
mouth
my
heart
she
said
and
put
his
hand
on
her
left
breast
he
could
feel
it
below
that
firm
almost
maddening
softness
racing
like
an
engine
your
hhheart
my
heart
they
were
on
the
bed
still
dressed
kissing
her
hand
slipped
inside
his
shirt
then
out
again
she
traced
a
finger
down
the
row
of
buttons
paused
at
his
waist
and
then
that
same
finger
slipped
lower
tracing
down
the
stony
thickness
of
his
cock
muscles
he
hadn't
been
aware
of
jumped
and
fluttered
in
his
groin
he
broke
the
kiss
and
moved
his
body
away
from
hers
on
the
bed
bill
got
to
stuhstuhstop
for
a
mmminute
he
said
or
else
i'm
going
to
shoot
in
my
pp
pants
like
a
kkid
she
laughed
again
softly
and
looked
at
him
is
it
that
or
are
you
having
second
thoughts
second
thoughts
bill
said
i
aaalways
have
those
don't
i
hate
hi
she
said
he
looked
at
her
the
smile
fading
i
didn't
know
it
all
the
way
to
the
top
of
my
mind
until
tonight
she
said
oh
i
knew
it
somewhere
all
along
i
guess
he
hits
and
he
hurts
i
married
him
because
because
my
father
always
worried
about
me
i
guess
no
matter
how
hard
i
tried
he
worried
and
i
guess
i
knew
he'd
approve
of
tom
because
tom
would
worry
too
he
worried
a
lot
and
as
long
as
someone
was
worrying
about
me
i'd
be
safe
more
than
safe
real
she
looked
at
him
solemnly
her
blouse
had
pulled
out
of
the
waistband
of
her
slacks
revealing
a
white
stripe
of
stomach
he
wanted
to
kiss
it
but
it
wasn't
real
it
was
a
nightmare
being
married
to
tom
was
like
going
back
into
the
nightmare
why
would
a
person
do
that
bill
why
would
a
person
go
back
into
the
nightmare
of
her
own
accord
bill
said
the
ooonly
reason
i
can
ffigure
is
that
ppeople
go
back
to
ff
find
themss
selves
the
nightmare
here
bev
said
the
nightmare
is
derry
tom
looks
small
compared
to
that
i
can
see
him
better
now
i
loathe
myself
for
the
years
i
spent
with
him
you
don't
know
the
things
he
made
me
do
and
oh
z
was
happy
enough
to
do
them
you
know
because
he
worried
about
me
i'd
cry
but
sometimes
there
too
much
shame
you
know
don't
he
said
quietly
and
put
his
hand
over
hers
she
held
it
tightly
her
eyes
were
overbright
but
the
tears
didn't
fall
everybody
gggoofs
it
but
it
not
an
ehehexam
you
just
go
through
it
the
bbbest
you
can
what
i
mea
she
said
is
that
i'm
not
cheating
on
tom
or
trying
to
use
you
to
get
my
own
back
on
him
or
anything
like
that
for
me
it
would
be
like
something
sane
and
normal
and
sweet
but
i
don't
want
to
hurt
you
bill
or
trick
you
into
something
you'll
be
sorry
for
later
he
thought
about
this
thought
about
it
with
a
real
and
deep
seriousness
but
the
odd
little
mnemonic
he
thrusts
his
fists
and
so
on
had
begun
to
circle
back
breaking
into
his
thoughts
it
had
been
a
long
day
mike
call
and
the
invitation
to
lunch
at
jade
of
the
orient
seemed
a
hundred
years
ago
so
many
stories
since
then
so
many
memories
like
photographs
from
george
album
friends
don't
tttrick
each
eothe
he
said
and
leaned
toward
her
on
the
bed
their
lips
touched
and
he
began
to
unbutton
her
blouse
one
of
her
hands
went
to
the
back
of
his
neck
and
held
him
closer
while
the
other
first
unzipped
her
slacks
and
then
pushed
them
down
for
a
moment
his
hand
was
on
her
stomach
warm
then
her
panties
were
gone
in
a
whisper
then
he
nudged
and
she
guided
as
he
entered
her
she
arched
her
back
gently
toward
the
thrust
of
his
sex
and
muttered
be
my
friend
i
love
you
bill
love
you
too
he
said
smiling
against
her
bare
shoulder
they
began
slowly
and
he
felt
sweat
begin
to
flow
out
of
his
skin
as
she
quickened
beneath
him
his
consciousness
began
to
drain
downward
becoming
focused
more
and
more
strongly
on
their
connection
her
pores
had
opened
releasing
a
lovely
musky
odor
beverly
felt
her
climax
coming
she
moved
toward
it
working
for
it
never
doubting
that
it
would
come
her
body
suddenly
stuttered
and
seemed
to
leap
upward
not
orgasming
but
reaching
a
plateau
far
above
any
she
had
reached
with
tom
or
the
other
two
lovers
she
had
had
before
tom
she
became
aware
that
this
wasn't
going
to
be
just
a
come
it
was
going
to
be
a
tactical
nuke
she
became
a
little
afraid
but
her
body
picked
up
the
rhythm
again
she
felt
bill
long
length
stiffen
against
her
his
whole
body
suddenly
becoming
as
hard
as
the
part
of
him
inside
herself
and
at
that
same
moment
she
climaxed
began
to
climax
pleasure
so
great
it
was
nearly
agony
spilled
out
of
unsuspected
floodgates
and
she
bit
down
on
his
shoulder
to
stifle
her
cries
oh
my
god
bill
gasped
and
although
she
was
never
sure
later
she
believed
he
was
crying
he
pulled
back
and
she
thought
he
was
going
to
withdraw
from
her
she
tried
to
prepare
for
that
moment
which
always
brought
a
fleeting
inexplicable
sense
of
loss
and
emptiness
something
like
a
footprint
and
then
he
thrust
forward
strongly
again
right
away
she
had
a
second
orgasm
something
she
hadn't
known
was
possible
for
her
and
the
window
of
memory
opened
again
and
she
saw
birds
thousands
of
birds
descending
onto
every
roofpeak
and
telephone
line
and
rfd
mailbox
in
derry
spring
birds
against
a
white
april
sky
and
there
was
pain
mixed
with
pleasure
but
mostly
it
was
low
as
a
white
spring
sky
seems
low
low
physical
pain
mixed
with
low
physical
pleasure
and
sense
of
affirmation
she
had
bled
she
had
had
all
of
you
she
cried
suddenly
her
eyes
widening
stunned
he
did
pul
back
and
out
of
her
this
time
but
in
the
sudden
shock
of
the
revelation
she
barely
felt
him
go
what
beverly
aare
you
all
all
of
you
i
made
love
to
all
of
yo
she
saw
shocked
surprise
on
bill
face
the
drop
of
his
jaw
and
sudden
understanding
but
it
was
not
her
revelation
even
in
her
own
shock
she
saw
that
it
was
his
own
we
bill
what
is
it
that
was
yyyour
way
to
get
us
out
he
said
and
now
his
eyes
blazed
so
brightly
they
frightened
her
beverly
duhduhdon't
you
uhunderstand
that
was
yyyour
way
to
get
us
out
we
all
but
we
were
suddenly
he
looked
frightened
unsure
do
you
remember
the
rest
now
she
asked
he
shook
his
head
slowly
not
the
spuhspuh
specifics
but
he
looked
at
her
and
she
saw
he
was
badly
frightened
what
it
really
eccame
down
to
was
we
wuhwuhwished
our
way
out
and
i'm
not
ssure
beverly
i'm
not
sure
that
grownups
can
do
that
she
looked
at
him
without
speaking
for
a
long
moment
and
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
took
her
clothes
off
with
no
particular
selfconsciousness
her
body
was
smooth
and
lovely
the
line
of
her
backbone
barely
discernible
in
the
dimness
as
she
bent
to
take
off
the
knee
high
nylon
stockings
she
had
been
wearing
her
hair
was
a
sheaf
coiled
over
one
shoulder
he
thought
he
would
want
her
again
before
morning
and
that
feeling
of
guilt
came
again
tempered
only
by
the
guilty
comfort
of
knowing
that
audra
was
an
ocean
away
put
another
nickle
in
the
jukebox
he
thought
this
tune
is
called
what
she
don't
know
won't
hurt
her
but
it
hurts
somewhere
in
the
spaces
between
people
maybe
beverly
got
up
and
turned
the
bed
down
come
to
bed
we
need
sleep
both
of
us
aaall
right
because
that
was
right
that
was
a
big
tenfour
more
than
anything
else
he
wanted
to
sleep
but
not
alone
not
tonight
the
latest
shock
was
wearing
off
too
quickly
perhaps
but
he
felt
so
tired
now
so
usedup
secondtosecond
reality
had
the
quality
of
a
dream
and
in
spite
of
the
guilt
he
felt
he
also
felt
that
this
was
a
safe
place
it
would
be
possible
to
lie
here
for
a
little
while
to
sleep
in
her
arms
he
wanted
her
warmth
and
her
friendliness
both
were
sexually
charged
but
that
could
hurt
neither
of
them
now
he
stripped
off
his
socks
and
shirt
and
got
in
next
to
her
she
pressed
against
him
her
breasts
warm
her
long
legs
cool
bill
held
her
aware
of
the
differences
her
body
was
longer
than
audra
and
fuller
at
the
breast
and
the
hip
but
it
was
a
welcome
body
it
should
have
been
ben
with
you
dear
he
thought
drowsily
i
think
that
was
the
way
it
was
really
supposed
to
be
why
wasn't
it
ben
because
it
was
you
then
and
it
you
now
that
all
because
what
goes
around
always
comes
around
i
think
bob
dylan
said
that
or
maybe
it
was
ronald
reagan
and
maybe
it
me
now
because
ben
the
one
who
supposed
to
see
the
lady
home
beverly
wriggled
against
him
not
in
a
sexual
way
although
even
as
he
fled
toward
sleep
she
felt
him
stir
again
against
her
leg
and
was
glad
but
only
wanting
his
warmth
she
was
already
half
asleep
herself
her
happiness
here
with
him
after
all
these
years
was
real
she
knew
that
because
of
its
bitter
undertaste
there
was
tonight
and
perhaps
there
would
be
another
tune
for
them
tomorrow
morning
then
they
would
go
down
in
the
sewers
as
they
had
before
and
they
would
find
their
it
the
circle
would
close
even
tighter
and
their
present
lives
would
merge
smoothly
with
their
own
childhoods
they
would
become
like
creatures
on
some
crazy
moebius
strip
either
that
or
they
would
die
down
there
she
turned
over
he
slipped
an
arm
between
her
side
and
her
arm
and
cupped
one
breast
gently
she
did
not
have
to
lie
awake
wondering
if
he
hand
might
suddenly
clamp
down
in
a
hard
pinch
her
thoughts
began
to
break
up
as
sleep
slid
into
her
as
always
she
saw
brilliant
wildflower
patterns
as
she
crossed
over
masses
and
masses
of
them
nodding
brightly
under
a
blue
sky
these
faded
and
there
was
a
falling
sensation
the
sort
of
sensation
that
had
sometimes
snapped
her
awake
and
sweating
as
a
child
a
scream
on
the
other
side
of
her
face
childhood
dreams
of
falling
she
had
read
in
her
college
psychology
text
were
common
but
she
didn't
snap
back
this
time
she
could
feel
the
warm
and
comforting
weight
of
bill
arm
his
hand
cradling
her
breast
she
thought
that
if
she
was
falling
at
least
she
wasn't
falling
alone
then
she
touched
down
and
was
running
this
dream
whatever
it
was
moved
fast
she
ran
after
it
pursuing
sleep
silence
maybe
just
time
the
years
moved
fast
the
years
ran
if
you
turned
around
and
ran
after
your
own
childhood
you'd
have
to
really
let
out
your
stride
and
bust
your
buns
twentynine
the
year
she
had
streaked
her
hair
faster
twentytwo
the
year
she
had
fallen
in
love
with
a
football
player
named
greg
mallory
who
had
damn
near
raped
her
after
a
fraternity
party
faster
faster
sixteen
getting
drunk
with
two
of
her
girlfriends
on
the
bluebird
hill
overlook
in
portland
fourteen
twelve
faster
faster
faster
she
ran
into
sleep
chasing
twelve
catching
it
running
through
the
barrier
of
memory
that
it
had
cast
over
all
of
them
it
tasted
like
cold
fog
in
her
laboring
dreamlungs
running
back
into
her
eleventh
year
running
running
like
hell
running
to
beat
the
devil
looking
back
now
looking
back
the
barrens
/
p.m
over
her
shoulder
for
any
sign
of
them
as
she
slipped
and
scrambled
her
way
down
the
embankment
no
sign
at
least
not
yet
she
had
really
fetched
it
to
him
as
her
father
sometimes
said
and
just
thinking
of
her
father
brought
another
wave
of
guilt
and
despondency
washing
over
her
she
looked
under
the
rickety
bridge
hoping
to
see
silver
heeled
over
on
his
side
but
silver
was
gone
there
was
a
cache
of
toy
guns
which
they
no
longer
bothered
to
take
home
and
that
was
all
she
started
down
the
path
looked
back
and
there
they
were
belch
and
victor
supporting
henry
between
them
standing
on
the
edge
of
the
embankment
like
indian
sentries
in
a
randolph
scott
movie
henry
was
horribly
pale
he
pointed
at
her
victor
and
belch
began
to
help
him
down
the
slope
dirt
and
gravel
spilled
from
beneath
their
heels
beverly
looked
at
them
for
a
long
moment
almost
hypnotized
then
she
turned
and
sprinted
through
the
trickle
of
brookwater
that
ran
out
from
under
the
bridge
ignoring
ben
steppingstones
her
sneakers
spraying
out
flat
sheets
of
water
she
ran
down
the
path
the
breath
hot
in
her
throat
she
could
feel
the
muscles
in
her
legs
trembling
she
didn't
have
much
left
now
the
clubhouse
if
she
could
get
there
she
might
still
be
safe
she
ran
along
the
path
branches
whipping
even
more
color
into
her
cheeks
one
striking
her
eye
and
making
it
water
she
cut
to
the
right
blundered
through
tangles
of
underbrush
and
came
out
into
the
clearing
both
the
camouflaged
trapdoor
and
the
slit
window
stood
open
rock
n
roll
drifted
up
at
the
sound
of
her
approach
ben
hanscom
popped
up
he
had
a
box
of
junior
mints
in
one
hand
and
an
archie
comic
book
in
the
other
he
got
a
good
look
at
bev
and
his
mouth
fell
open
under
other
circumstances
it
would
have
been
almost
funny
bev
what
the
hell
she
didn't
bother
replying
behind
her
and
not
too
far
behind
either
she
could
hear
branches
snapping
and
whipping
there
was
a
muffled
shouted
curse
it
sounded
as
if
henry
was
getting
livelier
so
she
just
ran
at
the
square
trapdoor
opening
her
hair
tangled
now
with
green
leaves
and
twigs
as
well
as
the
crud
from
her
scramble
under
the
garbage
truck
streaming
out
behind
her
ben
saw
she
was
coming
in
like
the
st
airborne
and
disappeared
as
quickly
as
he
had
come
out
beverly
jumped
and
he
caught
her
clumsily
shut
everything
she
panted
hurry
up
ben
for
heaven
sake
they're
coming
who
henry
and
his
friends
henry
gone
crazy
he
got
a
knife
that
was
enough
for
ben
he
dropped
his
junior
mints
and
his
funny
book
he
pulled
the
trapdoor
shut
with
a
grunt
the
top
was
covered
with
sods
tangletrack
was
still
holding
them
remarkably
well
a
few
blocks
of
sod
had
gotten
a
little
loose
but
that
was
all
beverly
stood
on
tiptoe
and
closed
the
window
they
were
in
darkness
she
groped
for
ben
found
him
and
hugged
him
with
panicky
tightness
after
a
moment
he
hugged
her
back
they
were
both
on
their
knees
with
sudden
horror
beverly
realized
that
richie
transistor
radio
was
still
playing
somewhere
in
the
blackness
little
richard
singing
the
girl
can't
help
it
ben
the
radio
they'll
hear
oh
go
he
bunted
her
with
one
meaty
hip
and
almost
knocked
her
sprawling
in
the
dark
she
heard
the
radio
fall
to
the
floor
the
girl
can't
help
it
if
the
menfolks
stop
and
stare
little
richard
informed
them
with
his
customary
hoarse
enthusiasm
can't
help
it
the
backup
group
testified
the
girl
can't
help
it
ben
was
panting
now
too
they
sounded
like
a
couple
of
steam
engines
suddenly
there
was
a
crunch
and
silence
oh
shit
ben
said
i
just
squashed
it
richie
gonna
have
a
bird
he
reached
for
her
in
the
dark
she
felt
his
hand
touch
one
of
her
breasts
then
jerk
away
as
if
burned
she
groped
for
him
got
hold
of
his
shirt
and
drew
him
close
beverly
what
shhh
he
quieted
they
sat
together
arms
around
each
other
looking
up
the
darkness
was
not
quite
perfect
there
was
a
narrow
line
of
light
down
one
side
of
the
trapdoor
and
three
others
outlined
the
slit
window
one
of
these
three
was
wide
enought
to
let
a
slanted
ray
of
sunlight
fall
into
the
clubhouse
she
could
only
pray
they
wouldn't
see
it
she
could
hear
them
approaching
at
first
she
couldn't
make
out
the
words
and
then
she
could
her
grip
on
ben
tightened
if
she
went
into
the
bamboo
we
can
pick
up
her
trail
easy
victor
was
saying
they
play
around
here
henry
replied
his
voice
was
strained
his
words
emerging
in
little
puffs
as
if
with
great
effort
boogers
taliendo
said
so
and
the
day
we
had
that
rockfight
they
were
coming
from
here
yeah
they
play
guns
and
stuff
belch
said
suddenly
there
were
thudding
footfalls
right
above
them
the
sodcovered
cap
vibrated
up
and
down
dirt
sifted
onto
beverly
upturned
face
one
two
maybe
even
all
three
of
them
were
standing
on
top
of
the
clubhouse
a
cramp
laced
her
belly
she
had
to
bite
down
against
a
cry
ben
put
one
big
hand
on
the
side
of
her
face
and
pressed
it
against
his
arm
as
he
looked
up
waiting
to
see
if
they
would
guess
or
if
they
knew
already
and
were
just
playing
games
they
got
a
place
henry
was
saying
that
what
boogers
told
me
some
kind
of
a
treehouse
or
something
they
call
it
their
club
tii
club
em
if
they
want
a
club
victor
said
belch
uttered
a
thunderous
heehawing
of
laughter
at
this
thump
thump
thump
overhead
the
cap
moved
up
and
down
a
little
more
this
time
surely
they
would
notice
it
ordinary
ground
just
didn't
have
that
kind
of
give
let
look
down
by
the
river
henry
said
i
bet
she
down
there
okay
victor
said
thump
thump
they
were
moving
off
bev
let
a
little
sigh
of
relief
trickle
through
her
clamped
teeth
and
then
henry
said
you
stay
here
and
guard
the
path
belch
okay
belch
said
and
he
began
to
march
back
and
forth
sometimes
leaving
the
cap
sometimes
coming
back
across
it
more
dirt
sifted
down
ben
and
beverly
looked
at
each
other
with
strained
dirty
faces
bev
became
aware
that
there
was
more
than
the
smell
of
smoke
in
the
clubhouse
a
sweaty
garbag
stink
was
rising
as
well
that
me
she
thought
dismally
in
spite
of
the
smell
she
hugged
ben
even
tighter
his
bulk
seemed
suddenly
very
welcome
very
comforting
and
she
was
glad
there
was
a
lot
of
him
to
hug
he
might
have
been
nothing
but
a
frightened
fatboy
when
school
let
out
for
the
summer
but
he
was
more
than
that
now
like
all
of
them
he
had
changed
if
belch
discovered
them
down
here
ben
just
might
give
him
a
surprise
til
club
em
if
they
want
a
club
belch
said
and
chuckled
a
belch
huggins
chuckle
was
a
low
trolllike
sound
club
em
if
they
want
a
club
that
good
that
pretty
much
okey
dokey
she
became
aware
that
ben
upper
body
was
heaving
up
and
down
in
short
sharp
movements
he
was
pulling
air
into
his
lungs
and
letting
it
out
in
sharp
little
bursts
for
one
alarmed
moment
she
thought
he
was
starting
to
cry
and
then
she
got
a
closer
look
at
his
face
and
realized
he
was
struggling
against
laughter
his
eyes
leaking
tears
caught
hers
rolled
madly
and
looked
away
in
the
faint
light
which
leaked
in
through
the
cracks
around
the
closed
trapdoor
and
the
window
she
could
see
his
face
was
nearly
purple
with
the
strain
of
holding
it
in
club
em
if
they
want
an
ole
clubbydubb
belch
said
and
sat
down
heavily
right
in
the
center
of
the
cap
this
time
the
roof
trembled
more
alarmingly
and
bev
heard
a
low
but
ominous
crrrack
from
one
of
the
supports
the
cap
had
been
meant
to
support
the
chunks
of
camouflagng
sod
laid
on
top
of
it
but
not
the
added
one
hundred
and
sixty
pounds
of
belch
huggins
weight
if
he
doesn't
get
up
he
going
to
land
in
our
laps
bev
thought
and
she
began
to
catch
ben
hysteria
it
was
trying
to
boil
out
of
her
in
rancid
whoops
and
brays
in
her
mind
eye
she
suddenly
saw
herself
pushing
the
window
up
enough
on
its
hinges
for
her
hand
to
creep
out
and
administer
a
really
good
goose
to
belch
huggins
backside
as
he
sat
there
in
the
hazy
afternoon
sunshine
muttering
and
giggling
she
buried
her
face
against
ben
chest
in
a
last
ditch
effort
to
keep
it
inside
shhh
ben
whispered
for
christ
sake
bev
ctrrrackk
louder
this
time
will
it
hold
she
whispered
back
tt
might
if
he
doesn't
fart
ben
said
and
a
moment
later
belch
did
cut
one
a
loud
and
fruity
trumpetblast
that
seemed
to
go
on
for
at
least
three
seconds
they
held
each
other
even
tighter
muffling
each
other
frantic
giggles
beverly
head
hurt
so
badly
that
she
thought
she
might
soon
have
a
stroke
then
faintly
she
heard
henry
yelling
belch
name
what
belch
bellowed
getting
up
with
a
thump
and
a
thud
that
sifted
more
dirt
down
on
ben
and
beverly
what
henry
'
henry
yelled
something
back
beverly
could
only
make
out
the
words
bank
and
bushes
okay
belch
bawled
and
his
feet
crossed
the
cap
for
the
last
time
there
was
a
final
cracking
noise
this
one
much
louder
and
a
splinter
of
wood
landed
in
bev
lap
she
picked
it
up
wonderingly
five
more
minutes
ben
said
in
a
low
whisper
that
all
it
would
have
taken
did
you
hear
him
when
he
let
go
beverly
asked
beginning
to
giggle
again
sounded
like
world
war
iii
ben
said
also
beginning
to
laugh
it
was
a
relief
to
be
able
to
let
it
out
and
they
laughed
wildly
trying
to
do
it
in
whispers
finally
unaware
she
was
going
to
say
it
at
all
and
certainly
not
because
it
had
any
discernible
bearing
on
this
situation
beverly
said
thank
you
for
the
poem
ben
ben
stopped
laughing
all
at
once
and
regarded
her
gravely
cautiously
he
took
a
dirty
handkerchief
from
his
back
pocket
and
wiped
his
face
with
it
slowly
poe
the
haiku
the
haiku
on
the
postcard
you
sent
it
didn't
you
n
ben
said
i
didn't
send
you
any
haiku
cause
if
a
kid
like
me
a
fat
kid
like
me
did
something
like
that
the
girl
would
probably
laugh
at
him
i
didn't
laugh
i
thought
it
was
beautiful
i
could
never
write
anything
beautiful
bill
maybe
not
me
bill
will
write
she
agreed
but
he'll
never
write
anything
as
nice
as
that
may
i
use
your
handkerchief
he
gave
it
to
her
and
she
began
to
clean
her
face
as
best
she
could
how
did
you
know
it
was
m
he
asked
finally
i
don't
know
she
said
just
did
ben
throat
worked
convulsively
he
looked
down
at
his
hands
i
didn't
mean
anything
by
it
she
looked
at
him
gravely
you
better
not
mean
that
she
said
if
you
do
it
really
going
to
spoil
my
day
and
i'll
tell
you
it
going
downhill
already
he
continued
to
look
down
at
his
hands
and
spoke
at
last
in
a
voice
she
could
barely
hear
well
i
mean
i
love
you
beverly
but
i
don't
want
that
to
spoil
anything
tt
won't
she
said
and
hugged
him
i
need
all
the
love
i
can
get
right
now
but
you
specially
like
bill
maybe
i
d
she
said
but
that
doesn't
matter
if
we
were
grownups
maybe
it
would
a
little
but
i
like
you
all
specially
you're
the
only
friends
i
have
i
love
you
too
ben
thank
yo
he
said
he
paused
trying
and
brought
it
out
he
was
even
able
to
look
at
her
as
he
said
it
i
wrote
the
poem
they
sat
without
saying
anything
for
a
little
while
beverly
felt
safe
protected
the
images
of
her
father’s
face
and
henry
knife
seemed
less
vivid
and
threatening
when
they
sat
close
like
this
that
sense
of
protection
was
hard
to
define
and
she
didn't
try
although
much
later
she
would
recognize
the
source
of
its
strength
she
was
in
the
arms
of
a
male
who
would
die
for
her
with
no
hesitation
at
all
it
was
a
fact
that
she
simply
knew
it
was
in
the
scent
that
came
from
his
pores
something
utterly
primitive
that
her
own
glands
could
respond
to
the
others
were
coming
back
ben
said
suddenly
what
if
they
get
caught
out
she
straightened
up
aware
that
she
had
almost
been
dozing
bill
she
remembered
had
invited
mike
hanlon
home
to
lunch
with
him
richie
was
going
to
go
home
with
stan
and
have
sandwiches
and
eddie
had
promised
to
bring
back
his
parcheesi
board
they
would
be
arriving
soon
totally
unaware
that
henry
and
his
friends
were
in
the
barrens
we've
got
to
get
to
them
beverly
said
henry’s
not
just
after
me
if
we
come
out
and
they
come
back
yes
but
at
least
we
know
they're
here
bill
and
the
other
guys
don't
eddie
can't
even
run
they
already
broke
his
arm
jeezumcro
ben
said
i
guess
we'll
have
to
chance
it
yeah
she
swallowed
and
looked
at
her
timex
it
was
hard
to
read
in
the
dimness
but
she
thought
it
was
a
little
past
one
ben
what
henry
really
gone
crazy
he
like
that
kid
in
the
blackboard
jungle
he
was
going
to
kill
me
and
the
other
two
were
going
to
help
him
aw
n
ben
said
henry
crazy
but
not
that
crazy
he
just
just
what
beverly
said
she
thought
of
henry
and
patrick
in
the
automobile
graveyard
in
the
thick
sunshine
henry
blank
eyes
ben
didn't
answer
he
was
thinking
things
had
changed
hadn't
they
when
you
were
inside
the
changes
they
were
harder
to
see
you
had
to
step
back
to
see
them
you
had
to
try
anyway
when
school
let
out
he'd
been
afraid
of
henry
but
only
because
henry
was
bigger
and
because
he
was
a
bully
the
kind
of
kid
who
would
grab
a
firstgrader
indian
rub
his
arm
and
send
him
away
crying
that
was
about
all
then
he
had
engraved
ben
belly
then
there
had
been
the
rockfight
and
henry
had
been
chucking
ms
at
people
heads
you
could
kill
somebody
with
one
of
those
things
you
could
kill
somebody
easy
he
had
started
to
look
different
haunted
almost
it
seemed
that
you
always
had
to
be
on
the
watch
for
him
the
way
you'd
always
have
to
be
on
the
watch
for
tigers
or
poisonous
snakes
if
you
were
in
the
jungle
but
you
got
used
to
it
so
used
to
it
that
it
didn't
even
seem
unusual
just
the
way
things
were
but
henry
was
crazy
wasn't
he
yes
ben
had
known
that
on
the
day
school
ended
and
had
willfully
refused
to
believe
it
or
remember
it
it
wasn't
the
kind
of
thing
you
wanted
to
believe
or
remember
and
suddenly
a
thought
a
thought
so
strong
it
was
almost
a
certainty
crept
into
his
mind
fullblown
as
cold
as
october
mud
it
using
henry
maybe
the
others
too
but
it
using
them
through
henry
and
if
that
the
truth
then
she
probably
right
it
not
just
indian
rubs
or
rabbitpunches
in
the
back
of
the
neck
during
studytime
near
the
end
of
the
schoolday
while
mrs
douglas
reads
her
book
at
her
desk
not
just
a
push
on
the
playground
so
that
you
fall
down
and
skin
your
knee
if
it
using
him
then
henry
will
use
the
knife
an
old
lady
saw
them
trying
to
beat
me
up
beverly
was
saying
henry
went
after
her
he
kicked
her
taillight
out
this
alarmed
ben
more
than
anything
else
he
understood
instinctively
as
most
kids
did
that
they
lived
below
the
sightlines
and
hence
the
thoughtlines
of
most
adults
when
a
grownup
was
dittybopping
down
the
street
thinking
his
grownup
thoughts
about
work
and
appointments
and
buying
cars
and
whatever
else
grownups
thought
about
he
never
noticed
kids
playing
hopscotch
or
guns
or
kickthecan
or
ringalevio
or
hideandgoseek
bullies
like
henry
could
get
away
with
hurting
other
kids
quite
a
lot
if
they
were
careful
to
stay
below
that
sightline
at
the
very
most
a
passing
adult
was
apt
to
say
something
like
why
don't
you
quit
that
and
then
just
continue
dittybopping
along
without
waiting
to
see
if
the
bully
stopped
or
not
so
the
bully
would
wait
until
the
grownup
had
turned
the
corner
and
then
go
back
to
business
as
usual
it
was
like
adults
thought
that
real
life
only
started
when
a
person
was
five
feet
tall
if
henry
had
gone
after
some
old
lady
he
had
gone
above
that
sightline
and
that
more
than
anything
else
suggested
to
ben
that
he
really
was
crazy
beverly
saw
the
belief
n
ben
face
and
felt
relief
sweep
over
her
she
would
not
have
to
tell
him
about
how
mr
ross
had
simply
folded
his
paper
and
walked
into
his
house
she
didn't
want
to
tell
him
about
that
it
was
too
scary
let
go
up
to
kansas
street
ben
said
and
abruptly
pushed
open
the
trapdoor
get
ready
to
run
he
stood
up
in
the
opening
and
looked
around
the
clearing
was
silent
he
could
hear
the
chuckling
voice
of
the
kenduskeag
close
by
birdsong
the
thumthudthumthud
of
a
diesel
engine
snorting
its
way
into
the
trainyards
he
heard
nothing
else
and
that
made
him
uneasy
he
would
have
felt
much
better
if
he'd
heard
henry
victor
and
belch
cursing
their
way
through
the
neavy
undergrowth
down
by
the
stream
but
he
couldn't
hear
them
at
all
come
on
he
said
and
helped
beverly
up
she
also
looked
around
uneasily
brushing
her
hair
back
with
her
hands
and
grimacing
at
its
greasy
feel
he
took
her
hand
and
they
pushed
through
a
screen
of
bushes
toward
kansas
street
we'd
better
stay
off
the
path
n
she
said
we've
got
to
hurry
he
nodded
all
right
they
got
to
the
path
and
started
toward
kansas
street
once
she
stumbled
over
a
rock
in
the
path
and
the
seminary
grounds
/
a.m
fell
heavily
on
the
moor
silvered
sidewalk
a
grunt
was
forced
out
of
him
and
a
runner
of
blood
came
with
the
grunt
splatting
on
the
cracked
concrete
in
the
moonlight
it
looked
as
black
as
beetleblood
henry
looked
at
it
for
a
long
dazed
moment
then
raised
his
head
to
look
around
kansas
street
was
earlymorning
silent
the
houses
shut
up
and
dark
except
for
a
scatter
of
nightlights
ah
here
was
a
sewer
grate
a
balloon
with
a
smileysmile
face
was
tied
to
one
of
its
iron
bars
it
bobbed
and
dipped
in
the
faint
breeze
henry
got
to
his
feet
again
one
sticky
hand
pressed
to
his
belly
the
nigger
had
stuck
him
pretty
good
but
henry
had
gone
him
one
better
yessir
as
far
as
the
nigger
was
concerned
henry
felt
like
he
was
pretty
much
okeydokey
kid
a
gone
goose
henry
muttered
and
made
his
shaky
staggering
way
past
the
floating
balloon
fresh
blood
glimmered
on
his
hand
as
it
continued
to
flow
from
his
stomach
kid
all
done
greased
the
sucker
gonna
grease
them
all

them
to
throw
rocks
the
world

coming
in

greased
himself
and
as
far
as
i
he
was
concerned
that
was
a
fuck

but
keep
an
ear
inside
his
head
it
kept
hearing
that
kaspanggg
sound
an
eye
inside
his
head
it
kept
seeing
victor
head
rising
on
the
end
of
that
spring
eyelids
and
cheeks
and
forehead
tattooed
with
rosettes
of
blood
henry
looked
blearily
to
his
left
and
saw
that
the
houses
had
been
replaced
with
a
tall
black
stand
of
hedge
looming
above
it
was
the
narrow
gloomily
victorian
pile
of
the
theological
seminary
not
a
window
shone
light
the
seminary
had
graduated
its
last
class
in
june
of
it
had
closed
its
doors
that
summer
and
whatever
walked
there
now
walked
abne
and
only
by
permission
of
the
chattering
women
club
that
called
itself
the
derry
historical
society
he
came
to
the
walk
which
led
up
to
the
front
door
it
was
barred
by
a
heavy
chain
from
which
a
metal
sign
hung
no
trespassin
this
order
enforced
by
derry
police
dept
henry
feet
tangled
on
this
track
and
he
fell
heavily
again
whap
to
the
sidewalk
up
ahead
a
car
turned
onto
kansas
street
from
hawthorne
its
headlights
washed
down
the
street
henry
fought
the
dazzle
long
enough
to
see
the
lights
on
top
it
was
a
fuzzmobile
he
crawled
under
the
chain
and
crabbed
his
way
to
the
left
so
he
was
behind
the
hedge
the
nightdew
on
his
hot
face
was
wonderful
he
lay
face
down
turning
his
head
from
side
to
side
wetting
his
cheeks
drinking
what
he
could
drink
the
police
car
floated
by
without
slowing
then
suddenly
its
bubblelights
came
on
washing
the
darkness
with
erratic
blue
pulses
of
light
there
was
no
need
for
the
siren
on
the
deserted
streets
but
henry
heard
its
null
suddenly
crank
up
to
full
revs
rubber
blistered
a
startled
scream
from
the
pavement
caught
i'm
caught
his
mind
gibbered
and
then
he
realized
that
the
policecar
was
heading
away
from
him
up
kansas
street
a
moment
later
a
hellish
warbling
sound
filled
the
night
heading
toward
him
from
the
south
he
imagined
some
huge
silky
black
cat
loping
through
the
dark
all
green
eyes
and
silky
flexing
pelt
it
in
a
new
shape
coming
for
him
coming
to
gobble
him
up
little
by
little
and
only
as
the
warbling
began
to
veer
away
he
realized
it
was
an
ambulance
heading
in
the
direction
the
fuzzmobile
had
gone
he
lay
shuddering
on
the
wet
grass
too
cold
now
struggling
fuzzit
cousin
buzzit
cousin
rock
it
roll
it
we
got
chicken
in
the
barn
what
bam
whose
barn
my
not
to
vomit
he
was
afraid
that
if
he
vomited
all
of
his
guts
would
come
up
and
there
were
five
of
them
still
to
get
ambulance
and
police
car
where
are
they
heading
the
library
of
course
the
nigger
but
they're
too
late
i
greased
him
might
as
well
turn
off
your
sireen
boys
he
ain't
gonna
hear
it
he
just
as
dead
as
a
fencepost
he
but
was
he
henry
licked
his
peeling
lips
with
his
arid
tongue
if
he
was
dead
there
would
be
no
warbling
siren
in
the
night
like
the
cry
of
a
wounded
panther
not
unless
the
nigger
had
called
them
so
maybe
just
maybe
the
nigger
wasn't
dead
n
henry
breathed
he
rolled
over
on
his
back
and
stared
up
at
the
sky
at
the
billions
of
stars
up
there
it
had
come
from
there
he
knew
from
somewhere
up
in
that
sky
it
came
from
outer
space
with
a
lust
for
earthwomen
came
to
rob
all
the
women
and
rape
all
the
men
say
frank
don't
you
mean
rob
all
the
men
and
rape
all
the
women
whoth
running
this
show
thilly
man
you
or
jesse
victor
used
to
tell
that
one
and
that
was
pretty
much
came
from
the
spaces
between
the
stars
looking
up
at
that
starry
sky
gave
him
the
creeps
it
was
too
big
too
black
it
was
all
too
possible
to
imagine
it
turning
bloodred
all
too
possible
to
imagine
a
face
forming
in
lines
of
fire
he
closed
his
eyes
shivering
and
holding
his
arms
crossed
on
his
belly
and
he
thought
the
nigger
is
dead
someone
heard
us
fighting
and
sent
the
cops
to
investigate
that
all
then
why
the
ambulance
shut
up
shut
up
henry
groaned
he
felt
the
old
baffled
rage
again
he
remembered
how
they
had
beaten
him
again
and
again
in
the
old
days
old
days
that
seemed
so
close
and
so
vital
now
how
every
time
when
he
believed
he
had
them
they
had
somehow
slipped
through
his
fingers
it
had
been
like
that
on
the
last
day
after
belch
saw
the
bitch
running
down
kansas
street
toward
the
barrens
he
remembered
that
oh
yes
he
remembered
that
clearly
enough
when
you
got
kicked
in
he
balls
you
remembered
it
it
had
happened
to
him
again
and
again
that
summer
henry
struggled
to
a
sitting
position
wincing
at
the
deep
dagger
of
pain
in
his
guts
victor
and
belch
had
helped
him
down
into
the
barrens
he
had
walked
as
fast
as
he
could
in
spite
of
the
agony
that
griped
and
pulled
at
his
groin
and
the
root
of
his
belly
the
time
had
come
to
finish
it
they
had
followed
the
path
to
a
clearing
from
which
five
or
six
paths
radiated
like
strands
of
a
spiderweb
yes
there
had
been
kids
playing
around
there
you
didn't
have
to
be
tonto
to
see
that
there
were
scraps
of
candywrapper
the
curled
tail
of
a
shot
off
roll
of
bang
caps
red
and
black
a
few
boards
and
a
fluffy
scatter
of
sawdust
as
if
something
had
been
built
there
he
remembered
standing
in
the
center
of
the
clearing
and
scanning
the
trees
looking
for
their
baby
treehouse
he
would
spot
it
and
then
he
would
climb
up
and
the
girl
would
be
cowering
there
and
he
would
use
the
knife
to
cut
her
throat
and
feel
her
titties
nice
and
easy
until
they
stopped
moving
but
he
hadn't
been
able
to
see
any
treehouse
neither
had
belch
or
victor
the
old
familiar
frustration
rose
in
his
throat
he
and
victor
left
belch
to
guard
the
clearing
while
they
went
down
the
river
but
there
had
been
no
sign
of
her
there
either
he
remembered
bending
over
and
picking
up
a
rock
and
the
barrens
/
p.m
heaving
it
far
down
the
stream
furious
and
bewildered
where
the
fuck
did
she
go
he
demanded
wheeling
toward
victor
victor
shook
his
head
slowly
don't
know
he
said
you're
bleeding
henry
looked
down
and
saw
a
dark
spot
the
size
of
a
quarter
on
the
crotch
of
his
jeans
the
pain
had
withdrawn
to
a
low
throbbing
ache
but
his
underpants
felt
too
small
and
too
tight
his
balls
were
swelling
he
felt
that
anger
inside
him
again
something
like
a
knotted
rope
around
his
heart
she
had
done
this
where
is
she
he
hissed
at
victor
don't
know
victor
said
again
in
that
same
dull
voice
he
seemed
hypnotized
sunstruck
not
really
there
at
all
ran
away
i
guess
she
could
be
all
the
way
over
to
the
old
cape
by
now
she
not
henry
said
she
hiding
they've
got
a
place
and
she
hiding
there
maybe
it
not
a
treehouse
maybe
it
something
else
what
t...don't...kno
henry
shouted
and
victor
flinched
back
henry
stood
in
the
kenduskeag
the
cold
water
boiling
over
the
tops
of
his
sneakers
looking
around
his
eyes
fixed
on
a
cylinder
poking
out
of
the
embankment
about
twenty
feet
downstream
a
pumpingstation
he
climbed
out
of
the
water
and
walked
down
to
it
feeling
a
sort
of
necessary
dread
settle
into
him
his
skin
seemed
to
be
tightening
his
eyes
widening
so
that
they
were
able
to
see
more
and
more
it
seemed
he
could
feel
the
tiny
hairs
in
his
ears
stirring
and
moving
like
kelp
in
an
underwater
tidal
flow
low
humming
came
from
the
pumpingstation
and
beyond
it
he
could
see
a
pipe
jutting
out
of
the
embankment
over
the
kenduskeag
a
steady
flow
of
sludge
pulsed
out
of
the
pipe
and
ran
into
the
water
he
leaned
over
the
cylinder
round
iron
top
henry
victor
called
nervously
henry
what
you
doing
henry
paid
no
attention
he
put
his
eye
to
one
of
the
round
holes
in
the
iron
and
saw
nothing
but
blackness
he
exchanged
eye
for
ear
wait
the
voice
drifted
up
to
him
from
the
blackness
inside
and
henry
felt
his
interior
temperature
plummet
to
zero
his
veins
and
arteries
freezing
into
crystal
tubes
of
ice
but
with
these
sensations
came
an
almost
unknown
feeling
love
his
eyes
widened
a
clownish
smile
spread
his
lips
in
a
large
nerveless
arc
it
was
the
voice
from
the
moon
now
it
was
down
in
the
pumping
station
down
in
the
drains
wait
watch
he
waited
but
there
was
no
more
only
the
steady
soporific
drone
of
the
pumping
machinery
he
walked
back
down
to
where
victor
stood
on
the
bank
watching
him
cautiously
henry
ignored
him
and
hollered
for
belch
in
a
little
while
belch
came
come
o
he
said
what
are
we
gonna
do
henr
belch
asked
wait
watch
they
crept
back
toward
the
clearing
and
sat
down
henry
tried
to
pull
his
underpants
away
from
his
aching
balls
but
it
hurt
too
much
henry
what
belch
began
shhh
belch
fell
obligingly
silent
henry
had
camels
but
he
didn't
share
them
out
he
didn't
want
the
bitch
to
smell
cigarette
smoke
if
she
was
around
he
could
have
explained
but
there
was
no
need
the
voice
had
only
spoken
two
words
to
him
but
they
seemed
to
explain
everything
they
played
down
here
soon
the
others
would
come
back
why
settle
for
just
the
bitch
when
they
could
have
all
seven
of
the
little
shitepokes
they
waited
and
watched
victor
and
belch
seemed
to
have
gone
to
sleep
with
their
eyes
open
it
was
not
a
long
wait
but
there
was
time
for
henry
to
think
of
a
good
many
things
how
he
had
found
the
switchblade
this
morning
for
instance
it
wasn't
the
same
one
he'd
had
on
the
last
day
of
school
he'd
lost
that
one
somewhere
this
one
looked
a
lot
cooler
it
came
in
the
mail
sort
of
he
had
stood
on
the
porch
looking
at
their
battered
leaning
rfd
box
trying
to
grasp
what
he
was
seeing
the
box
was
decked
with
balloons
two
were
tied
to
the
metal
hook
where
the
postman
sometimes
hung
packages
others
were
tied
to
the
flag
red
yellow
blue
green
it
was
as
if
some
weird
circus
had
crept
by
on
witcham
road
in
the
dead
of
night
leaving
this
sign
as
he
approached
the
mailbox
he
saw
there
were
faces
on
the
balloons
the
faces
of
the
kids
who
had
deviled
him
all
this
summer
the
kids
who
seemed
to
mock
him
at
every
turn
he
had
stared
at
these
apparitions
gapemouthed
and
then
the
balloons
popped
one
by
one
that
had
been
good
it
was
as
if
he
were
making
them
pop
just
by
thinking
about
it
killing
them
with
his
mind
the
front
of
the
mailbox
suddenly
swung
down
henry
walked
toward
it
and
peered
in
although
the
mailman
didn't
get
this
far
out
until
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
he
felt
no
surprise
when
he
saw
a
flat
rectangular
package
inside
he
pulled
it
out
mr
henry
bowers
red
#
derry
maine
the
address
read
there
was
even
a
returnaddress
of
sorts
mr
robert
gray
derry
maine
he
opened
the
package
letting
the
brown
paper
drift
down
heedlessly
by
his
feet
there
was
a
white
box
inside
he
opened
it
lying
on
a
bed
of
white
cotton
had
been
the
switchknife
he
took
it
into
the
house
his
father
was
lying
on
his
pallet
in
the
bedroom
they
shared
surrounded
by
empty
beer
cans
his
belly
bulging
over
the
top
of
his
yellow
underpants
henry
knelt
beside
him
listening
to
the
snort
and
flutter
of
his
father
breathing
watching
his
father’s
horsy
lips
purse
and
pucker
with
each
breath
henry
placed
the
businessend
of
the
switchknife
against
his
father
scrawny
neck
his
father
moved
a
little
and
then
settled
back
into
beery
sleep
again
henry
kept
the
knife
like
that
for
almost
five
minutes
his
eyes
distant
and
thoughtful
the
ball
of
his
left
thumb
caressing
the
silver
button
set
into
the
switchblade
neck
the
voice
from
the
moon
spoke
to
him
it
whispered
like
the
spring
wind
which
is
warm
with
a
cold
blade
buried
somewhere
in
its
middle
it
buzzed
like
a
paper
nest
full
of
roused
hornets
it
huckstered
like
a
hoarse
politician
everything
the
voice
said
seemed
pretty
much
okeydokey
to
henry
and
so
he
pushed
the
silver
button
there
was
a
click
inside
the
knife
as
the
suicidespring
let
go
and
six
inches
of
steel
drove
through
butch
bowers
neck
it
went
in
as
easily
as
the
tines
of
a
meatfork
into
the
breast
of
a
wellroasted
chicken
the
tip
of
the
blade
popped
out
on
the
other
side
dripping
butch
eyes
flew
open
he
stared
at
the
ceiling
his
mouth
dropped
open
blood
ran
from
the
corners
of
it
and
down
his
cheeks
toward
the
lobes
of
his
ears
he
began
to
gurgle
a
large
bloodbubble
formed
between
his
slack
lips
and
popped
one
of
his
hands
crept
to
henry
knee
and
squeezed
convulsively
henry
didn't
mind
presently
the
hand
fell
away
the
gurgling
noises
stopped
a
moment
later
butch
bowers
was
dead
henry
pulled
the
knife
out
wiped
it
on
the
dirty
sheet
that
covered
his
father
pallet
and
pushed
the
blade
back
in
until
the
spring
clicked
again
he
looked
at
his
father
without
much
interest
the
voice
had
told
him
about
the
day
work
while
he
knelt
beside
butch
with
the
knife
against
butch
neck
the
voice
had
explained
everything
so
he
went
into
the
other
room
to
call
belch
and
victor
now
here
they
were
all
three
and
although
his
balls
still
ached
horribly
the
knife
made
a
comforting
bulge
in
his
left
front
pants
pocket
he
felt
that
the
cutting
would
begin
soon
the
others
would
come
back
down
to
resume
whatever
baby
game
they
had
been
playing
and
then
the
cutting
would
begin
the
voice
from
the
moon
had
laid
it
out
for
him
as
he
knelt
by
his
father
and
on
his
way
into
town
he
had
been
unable
to
take
his
eyes
from
that
pale
ghost
disc
in
the
sky
he
saw
that
there
was
indeed
a
man
in
the
moon
a
grisly
glimmering
ghostface
with
cratered
holes
for
eyes
and
a
glabrous
grin
that
seemed
to
reach
halfway
up
its
cheekbones
it
talked
we
float
down
here
henry
we
all
float
you'll
float
too
all
the
way
to
town
kill
them
all
henry
the
ghostvoice
from
the
moon
said
and
henry
could
dig
it
henry
felt
he
could
second
that
emotion
he
would
kill
them
all
his
tormentors
and
then
those
feelings
that
he
was
losing
his
grip
that
he
was
coming
inexorably
to
a
larger
world
he
would
not
be
able
to
dominate
as
he
had
dominated
the
playyard
at
derry
elementary
that
in
the
wider
world
the
fatboy
and
the
nigger
and
the
stuttering
freak
might
somehow
grow
larger
while
he
somehow
only
grew
older
would
be
gone
he
would
kill
them
all
and
the
voices
those
inside
and
the
one
which
spoke
to
him
from
the
moon
would
leave
him
alone
he
would
kill
them
and
then
go
back
to
the
house
and
sit
on
the
back
porch
with
his
father
souvenir
jap
sword
across
his
lap
he
would
drink
one
of
his
father
rheingolds
he
would
listen
to
the
radio
too
but
no
baseball
baseball
was
strictly
squaresville
he
would
listen
to
rock
and
roll
instead
although
henry
didn't
know
it
and
wouldn't
have
cared
if
he
did
on
this
one
subject
he
and
the
losers
agreed
rock
and
roll
was
pretty
much
okeydokey
we
got
chicken
in
the
barn
whose
barn
what
barn
my
barn
everything
would
be
good
then
everything
would
be
the
ginchiest
then
everything
would
be
okeyfine
then
and
anything
which
might
come
next
would
not
matter
the
voice
would
take
care
of
him
he
sensed
that
if
you
took
care
of
it
it
would
take
care
of
you
that
was
how
things
had
always
been
in
derry
but
the
kids
had
to
be
stopped
stopped
soon
stopped
today
the
voice
had
told
him
so
henry
took
his
new
knife
out
of
his
pocket
looked
at
it
turned
it
this
way
and
that
admiring
the
way
the
sun
winked
and
slid
off
the
chrome
facing
then
belch
was
grabbing
his
arm
and
hissing
look
that
henry
jeezlyold
crow
look
that
henry
looked
and
felt
the
clear
light
of
understanding
burst
over
him
a
square
section
of
the
clearing
was
rising
as
if
by
magic
revealing
a
growing
slice
of
darkness
beneath
for
just
a
moment
he
felt
a
jolt
of
terror
as
it
occurred
to
him
that
this
might
be
the
owner
of
the
voice
for
surely
it
lived
somewhere
under
the
aty
then
he
heard
the
gritty
squall
of
dirt
in
the
hinges
and
understood
they
hadn't
been
able
to
see
the
treehouse
because
there
was
none
by
god
we
was
standin
right
on
top
of
em
victor
grunted
and
as
ben
head
and
shoulders
appeared
in
the
square
hatchway
in
the
center
of
the
clearing
he
made
as
if
to
charge
forward
henry
grabbed
him
and
held
him
back
ain't
we
gonna
get
em
henry
victor
asked
as
ben
boosted
himself
up
both
of
them
were
puffing
and
blowing
we'll
get
em
henry
said
never
taking
his
eyes
from
the
hated
fatboy
another
ball
kicker
i'l
kick
your
balls
so
high
up
you
can
wear
them
for
earrings
you
fat
fuck
wait
and
see
if
i
don't
don't
worry
the
fatboy
was
helping
the
bitch
out
of
the
hole
she
looked
around
doubtfully
and
for
a
moment
henry
believed
she
looked
right
at
him
then
her
eyes
passed
on
the
two
of
them
murmured
together
and
then
they
pushed
their
way
into
the
thick
undergrowth
and
were
gone
come
on
henry
said
when
the
sound
of
mapping
branches
and
rustling
leaves
had
faded
almost
to
inaudibility
we'll
follow
em
but
keep
back
and
keep
quiet
i
want
em
all
together
the
three
of
them
crossed
the
clearing
like
soldiers
on
patrol
bent
low
their
eyes
wide
and
moving
belch
paused
to
look
down
into
the
clubhouse
and
shook
his
head
in
admiring
wonder
sittin
right
over
their
heads
i
was
he
said
henry
motioned
him
forward
impatiently
they
took
the
path
because
it
was
quieter
they
were
halfway
back
to
kansas
street
when
the
bitch
and
the
fatboy
holding
hands
isn't
that
cute
henry
thought
in
a
kind
of
ecstasy
emerged
almost
directly
in
front
of
them
luckily
their
backs
were
to
henry
group
and
neither
of
them
looked
around
henry
victor
and
belch
foze
then
drew
into
the
shadows
at
the
side
of
the
path
soon
ben
and
beverly
were
just
two
shirts
seen
through
a
tangle
of
shrubs
and
bushes
the
three
of
them
began
to
pursue
again
cautiously
henry
took
the
knife
out
again
and
henry
gets
a
lift
/
a.m
pressed
the
chrome
button
in
the
handle
the
blade
popped
out
he
looked
at
it
dreamily
in
the
moonlight
he
liked
the
way
the
starlight
ran
along
the
blade
he
had
no
idea
exactly
what
time
it
was
he
was
drifting
in
and
out
of
reality
now
a
sound
impinged
on
his
consciousness
and
began
to
grow
it
was
a
car
engine
it
drew
closer
henry
eyes
widened
in
the
dark
he
held
the
knife
more
tightly
waiting
for
the
car
to
pass
by
it
didn't
it
drew
up
at
the
curb
beyond
the
seminary
hedge
and
simply
stopped
there
engine
idling
grimacing
his
belly
was
stiffening
now
it
had
gone
boardhard
and
the
blood
seeping
sluggishly
between
his
fingers
had
the
consistency
of
sap
just
before
you
took
the
taps
out
of
the
maples
in
late
march
or
early
april
he
got
on
his
knees
and
pushed
aside
the
stiff
hedgebranches
he
could
see
headlights
and
the
shape
of
a
car
cops
his
hand
squeezed
the
knife
and
relaxed
squeezed
and
relaxed
squeezed
and
relaxed
i
sent
you
a
ride
henry
the
voice
whispered
sort
of
a
taxi
if
you
can
dig
that
after
all
we
have
to
get
you
over
there
to
the
town
house
pretty
soon
the
night
getting
old
the
voice
uttered
one
thin
bonelike
chuckle
and
fell
silent
now
the
only
sounds
were
the
crickets
and
the
steady
rumble
of
the
idling
car
sounds
like
cherrybomb
mufflers
henry
thought
distractedly
he
got
awkwardly
to
his
feet
and
worked
his
way
back
to
the
seminary
walk
he
peeked
around
at
the
car
not
a
fuzzmobile
no
bubbles
on
the
roof
and
the
shape
was
all
wrong
the
shape
was
old
henry
heard
that
giggle
again
or
perhaps
it
was
only
the
wind
he
emerged
from
the
shadow
of
the
hedge
crawled
under
the
chain
got
to
his
feet
again
and
began
to
walk
toward
the
idling
car
which
existed
in
a
blackandwhite
polaroid
snapshot
world
of
bright
moonlight
and
impenetrable
shadow
henry
was
a
mess
his
shirt
was
black
with
blood
and
it
had
soaked
through
his
jeans
almost
to
the
knees
his
face
was
a
white
blotch
under
an
institutional
crewcut
he
reached
the
intersection
of
the
seminary
path
and
the
sidewalk
and
peered
at
the
car
trying
to
make
sense
out
of
the
hulk
behind
the
wheel
but
it
was
the
car
he
recognized
first
it
was
the
one
his
father
always
swore
he
would
own
someday
a
plymouth
fury
it
was
red
and
white
and
henry
knew
hadn't
his
father
told
him
often
enough
that
the
engine
rumbling
under
the
hood
was
a
v
available
horsepower
of
able
to
hit
seventy
from
the
gitgo
in
just
about
nine
seconds
gobbling
hitest
through
its
fourbarrel
carb
i'm
gonna
get
that
car
and
then
when
i
die
they
can
bury
me
in
it
butch
had
been
fond
of
saying
except
of
course
he
had
never
gotten
the
car
and
the
state
had
buried
him
after
henry
had
been
taken
away
raving
and
screaming
of
monsters
to
the
funny
farm
if
that
him
inside
i
don't
think
i
can
take
it
henry
thought
squeezing
down
on
the
knife
swaying
drunkenly
back
and
forth
looking
at
the
shape
behind
the
wheel
then
the
passenger
door
of
the
fury
swung
open
the
domelight
came
on
and
the
driver
turned
to
look
at
him
it
was
belch
huggins
his
face
was
a
hanging
ruin
one
of
his
eyes
was
gone
and
a
rotted
hole
in
one
parchment
cheek
revealed
blackened
teeth
perched
on
belch
head
was
the
new
york
yankees
baseball
cap
he
had
been
wearing
the
day
he
died
it
was
turned
around
backward
gray
green
mold
oozed
along
the
bill
belch
henry
cried
and
agony
ripped
its
way
up
from
his
belly
making
him
cry
out
again
wordlessly
belch
dead
lips
stretched
in
a
grin
splitting
open
in
whitish
gray
bloodless
folds
he
held
one
twisted
hand
out
toward
the
open
door
in
invitation
henry
hesitated
then
shuffled
around
the
fury
grille
allowing
one
hand
to
touch
the
v
shaped
emblem
there
just
as
he
had
always
touched
it
when
his
father
took
him
into
the
bangor
showroom
when
he
was
a
kid
to
look
at
this
same
car
as
he
reached
the
passenger
side
grayness
overwhelmed
him
in
a
soft
wave
and
he
had
to
grab
the
open
door
to
keep
his
feet
he
stood
there
head
down
breathing
in
snuffling
gasps
at
last
the
world
came
back
partway
anyhow
and
he
was
able
to
work
his
way
around
the
door
and
fall
into
the
seat
pain
skewered
his
guts
again
and
fresh
blood
squirted
out
into
his
hand
it
felt
like
warm
jelly
he
put
his
head
back
and
gritted
his
teeth
the
cords
on
his
neck
standing
out
at
last
the
pain
began
to
subside
a
little
the
door
swung
shut
by
itself
the
domelight
went
out
henry
saw
one
of
belch
rotted
hands
close
over
the
transmission
lever
and
drop
it
into
drive
the
bunched
white
knots
of
belch
knuckles
glimmered
through
the
decaying
flesh
of
his
fingers
the
fury
began
to
move
down
kansas
street
toward
up
mile
hill
how
you
doin
belch
henry
heard
himself
say
it
was
stupid
of
course
belch
couldn't
be
here
dead
people
couldn't
drive
cars
but
it
was
all
he
could
think
of
belch
didn't
reply
his
one
sunken
eye
stared
at
the
road
his
teeth
glared
sickly
at
henry
through
the
hole
in
his
cheek
henry
became
vaguely
aware
that
ole
belch
smelled
pretty
ripe
ole
belch
smelled
in
fact
like
a
bushetbasket
of
tomatoes
that
had
gone
bad
and
watery
the
glove
compartment
flopped
open
banging
henry
knees
and
in
the
light
of
the
small
bulb
inside
he
saw
a
bottle
of
texas
driver
halffull
he
took
it
out
opened
it
and
had
himself
a
good
shot
it
went
down
like
cool
silk
and
hit
his
stomach
like
an
explosion
of
lava
he
shuddered
all
over
moaning
and
then
began
to
feel
a
little
better
a
litte
more
connected
to
the
world
thanks
he
said
belch
head
turned
toward
him
henry
could
hear
the
tendons
in
belch
nec
the
sound
was
like
the
scream
of
rusty
screendoor
hinges
belch
regarded
him
for
a
moment
with
a
dead
oneeyed
stare
and
henry
realized
for
the
first
time
that
most
of
belch
nose
was
gone
it
looked
like
something
had
been
at
the
ole
belcher
nose
dog
maybe
or
maybe
rats
rats
seemed
more
likely
the
tunnels
they
had
chased
the
little
kids
into
that
day
had
been
full
of
rats
moving
just
as
slowly
belch
head
turned
toward
the
road
again
henry
was
glad
ole
belch
staring
at
him
that
way
well
henry
hadn't
been
able
to
dig
it
too
much
there
had
been
something
in
belch
single
sunken
eye
reproach
anger
what
there
is
a
dead
boy
behind
the
wheel
of
this
car
henry
looked
down
at
his
arm
and
saw
that
huge
goosebumps
had
formed
there
he
quickly
had
another
snort
from
the
bottle
this
one
hit
a
little
easier
and
spread
its
warmth
farther
the
plymouth
rolled
down
upmile
hill
and
made
its
way
around
the
counterclockwise
traffic
circle
except
at
this
time
of
night
there
was
no
traffic
all
the
trafficlights
had
changed
to
yellow
bunkers
splashing
the
empty
streets
and
closed
buildings
with
steady
pulses
of
light
it
was
so
quiet
that
henry
could
hear
the
relays
clicking
inside
each
light
or
was
that
his
imagination
never
meant
to
leave
you
behind
that
day
belcher
henry
said
i
mean
if
that
was
you
know
on
your
mind
that
scream
of
dried
tendons
again
belch
looking
at
him
again
with
his
one
sunken
eye
and
his
lips
stretched
in
a
terrible
grin
that
revealed
grayblack
gums
which
were
growing
their
own
garden
of
mold
what
sort
of
a
grin
is
that
henry
asked
himself
as
the
car
purred
silkily
up
main
street
past
freese
on
the
one
side
nan
luncheonette
and
the
aladdin
theater
on
the
other
is
it
a
forgiving
grin
an
oldpals
grin
or
is
it
the
kind
of
grin
that
says
i'm
going
to
get
you
henry
i'm
going
to
get
you
for
running
out
on
me
and
vie
what
kind
of
grin
you
have
to
understand
how
it
was
henry
said
and
then
stopped
how
had
it
been
it
was
all
confused
in
his
mind
the
pieces
jumbled
up
like
the
pieces
of
a
jigsaw
puzzle
that
had
just
been
dumped
out
m
one
of
the
shitty
cardtables
in
the
rec
room
at
jumper
hill
how
had
it
been
exactly
they
had
followed
the
fatboy
and
the
bitch
back
to
kansas
street
and
had
waited
back
in
the
bushes
watching
them
climb
up
the
embankment
to
the
top
if
they
had
disappeared
from
view
he
and
victor
and
belch
would
have
dropped
the
stalking
game
and
simply
gone
after
them
two
of
them
were
better
than
none
at
all
and
the
rest
would
be
along
in
time
but
they
hadn't
disappeared
they
had
simply
leaned
against
the
fence
talking
and
watching
the
street
every
now
and
then
they
would
check
down
the
slope
into
the
barrens
but
henry
kept
his
two
troops
well
out
of
sight
the
sky
henry
remembered
had
become
overcast
clouds
moving
in
from
the
east
the
air
thickening
there
would
be
rain
that
afternoon
what
had
happened
next
what
a
bony
leathery
hand
closed
over
his
forearm
and
henry
screamed
he
had
been
drifting
away
again
into
that
cottony
grayness
but
belch
dreadful
touch
and
the
dagger
of
pain
in
his
stomach
from
the
scream
brought
him
back
he
looked
around
and
belch
face
was
less
than
two
inches
from
henry
he
gasped
in
breath
and
wished
he
hadn't
the
ole
belcher
really
had
gone
to
seed
henry
was
again
reminded
of
tomatoes
going
quietly
putrescent
in
some
shadowy
shed
comer
his
stomach
roiled
he
remembered
the
end
suddenly
the
end
for
belch
and
vie
anyway
how
something
had
come
out
of
the
darkness
as
they
stood
in
a
shaft
with
a
sewergrating
at
the
top
wondering
which
way
to
go
next
something
henry
hadn't
been
able
to
tell
what
until
victor
shrieked
frankenstein
it
frankenstein
and
so
it
was
it
was
the
frankenstein
monster
with
bolts
coming
out
of
its
neck
and
a
deep
stitched
scar
across
its
forehead
lurching
along
in
shoes
like
a
child
blocks
frankenstein
vie
had
screamed
fr
and
then
vic
head
was
gone
vic
head
was
flying
across
the
shaftway
to
strike
the
stonework
of
the
far
side
with
a
sour
sticky
thud
the
monster
watery
yellow
eyes
had
fallen
on
henry
and
henry
had
frozen
his
bladder
let
go
and
he
felt
warmth
flood
down
his
legs
the
creature
lurched
toward
him
and
belch
belch
had
listen
i
know
i
ra
henry
said
i
shouldn't
have
done
that
but
but
belch
only
stared
got
lost
henry
whispered
as
if
to
tell
the
ole
belcher
that
he
had
paid
too
it
sounded
weak
like
saying
yeah
i
know
you
got
killed
belch
but
i
got
one
fuck
of
a
splinter
under
my
thumbnail
but
it
had
been
bad
really
bad
he
had
wandered
around
in
a
world
of
stinking
darkness
for
hours
and
finally
he
remembered
he
had
started
to
scream
at
some
point
he
had
fallen
a
long
dizzying
fall
in
which
he
had
time
to
think
oh
good
in
a
minute
i'll
be
dead
i'll
be
out
of
this
and
then
he
had
been
in
fastrunning
water
under
the
canal
he
supposed
he
had
come
out
into
fading
sunlight
had
flailed
his
way
toward
the
bank
and
had
finally
climbed
out
of
the
kenduskeag
less
than
fifty
yards
from
the
place
where
adrian
mellon
would
drown
twentysix
years
later
he
slipped
fell
bashed
his
head
blacked
out
when
he
woke
up
it
was
after
dark
he
had
somehow
found
his
way
out
to
route
and
had
hooked
a
ride
to
the
home
place
and
there
the
cops
had
been
waiting
for
him
but
that
was
then
and
this
was
now
belch
had
stepped
in
front
of
frankenstein
monster
and
it
had
peeled
the
left
side
of
his
face
down
to
the
skull
so
much
henry
had
seen
before
fleeing
but
now
belch
was
back
and
belch
was
pointing
at
something
henry
saw
that
they
had
pulled
up
in
front
of
the
derry
town
house
and
suddenly
he
understood
perfectly
the
town
house
was
the
only
real
hotel
left
in
derry
back
in
there
had
also
been
the
eastern
star
at
the
end
of
exchange
street
and
the
traveller
rest
on
torrault
street
both
had
disappeared
during
urban
renewal
henry
knew
all
about
this
he
had
read
the
derry
news
faithfully
every
day
in
juniper
hill
only
the
town
house
was
left
and
a
bunch
of
tickytacky
little
motels
out
by
the
interstate
that
where
they'll
be
he
thought
right
in
there
all
of
them
that
are
left
asleep
in
their
beds
with
visions
of
sugarplums
or
sewers
maybe
dancing
in
their
heads
and
i'll
get
them
one
by
one
i'll
get
them
he
took
the
bottle
of
texas
driver
out
again
and
bit
off
a
snort
he
could
feel
fresh
blood
trickling
into
his
lap
and
the
seat
was
tacky
beneath
him
but
the
wine
made
it
better
the
wine
seemed
to
make
it
not
matter
he
could
have
done
with
some
good
bourbon
but
the
driver
was
better
than
nothing
look
he
said
to
belch
t'm
sorry
i
ran
i
don't
know
why
i
ran
please
don't
be
mad
belch
spoke
for
the
first
and
only
time
but
the
voice
wasn't
his
voice
the
voice
that
came
from
belch
rotting
mouth
was
deep
and
powerful
terrifying
henry
whimpered
at
the
sound
of
it
it
was
the
voice
from
the
moon
the
voice
of
the
clown
the
voice
he
had
heard
in
his
dreams
of
drains
and
sewers
where
water
rushed
on
and
on
just
shut
up
and
get
them
the
voice
said
sure
henry
whined
sure
okay
i
want
to
no
problem
he
put
the
bottle
back
in
the
glove
compartment
its
neck
chattered
briefly
like
teeth
and
he
saw
a
paper
where
the
bottle
had
been
he
took
it
out
and
unfolded
it
leaving
bloody
fingerprints
on
the
corners
embossed
across
the
top
was
this
logo
in
bright
scarlet
g

their

mmbers
that
was
good
that
saved
time
thanks
be
but
belch
was
gone
the
driver
seat
was
empty
there
was
only
the
new
york
yankees
baseball
cap
lying
there
mold
crusted
on
its
bill
and
some
slimy
stuff
on
the
knob
of
the
gearshift
henry
stared
his
heart
beating
painfully
in
his
throat
and
then
he
seemed
to
hear
something
move
and
shift
in
the
back
seat
he
got
out
quickly
opening
the
door
and
almost
falling
to
the
pavement
in
his
haste
he
gave
the
fury
which
still
burbled
softly
through
its
dual
cherrybomb
mufflers
cherrybombs
had
been
outlawed
in
the
state
of
maine
in

a
wide
berth
it
was
hard
to
walk
each
step
pulled
and
tore
at
his
belly
but
he
gained
the
sidewalk
and
stood
there
looking
at
the
eightfloor
brick
building
which
along
with
the
library
and
the
aladdin
theater
and
the
seminary
was
one
of
the
few
he
remembered
clearly
from
the
old
days
most
of
the
lights
on
the
upper
floors
were
out
now
but
the
frostedglass
globes
which
flanked
the
main
doorway
blazed
softly
in
the
darkness
haloed
with
moisture
from
the
lingering
groundfog
henry
made
his
laborious
way
toward
and
between
them
shouldering
open
one
of
the
doors
the
lobby
was
weehours
silent
there
was
a
faded
turkish
rug
on
the
floor
the
ceiling
was
a
huge
mural
executed
in
rectangular
panels
which
showed
scenes
from
derry
logging
days
there
were
overstuffed
sofas
and
wing
chairs
and
a
great
fireplace
which
was
now
dead
and
silent
a
birch
log
thrown
across
the
andirons
a
real
log
no
gas
the
fireplace
in
the
town
house
was
not
just
a
piece
of
lobby
stage
dressing
plants
spilled
out
of
low
pots
the
glass
double
doors
leading
to
the
bar
and
the
restaurant
were
closed
from
some
inner
office
henry
could
hear
the
gabble
of
a
tv
turned
low
he
lurched
across
the
lobby
his
pants
and
shirt
streaked
with
blood
blood
was
grimed
into
the
folds
of
his
hands
it
ran
down
his
cheeks
and
slashed
his
forehead
like
warpaint
his
eyes
bulged
from
their
sockets
anyone
in
the
lobby
who
had
seen
him
would
have
run
screaming
in
terror
but
there
was
no
one
the
elevator
doors
opened
as
soon
as
he
pushed
the
up
button
he
looked
at
the
paper
in
his
hand
then
at
the
floor
buttons
after
a
moment
of
deliberation
he
pushed
and
the
doors
closed
there
was
a
faint
hum
of
machinery
as
the
elevator
began
to
rise
might
as
well
start
at
the
top
and
work
my
way
down
he
slumped
against
the
rear
wall
of
the
car
eyes
halfclosed
the
hum
of
the
elevator
was
soothing
like
the
hum
of
the
machinery
in
the
pumpingstations
of
the
drainage
system
that
day
it
kept
coming
back
to
him
how
everything
seemed
almost
prearranged
as
if
all
of
them
were
just
playing
parts
how
vie
and
the
ole
belcher
had
seemed
well
almost
drugged
he
remembered
the
car
came
to
a
stop
jolting
him
and
sending
another
wave
of
griping
pain
into
his
stomach
the
doors
slid
open
henry
stepped
out
into
the
silent
hallway
more
plants
here
hanging
ones
spiderplants
he
didn't
want
to
touch
any
of
them
not
those
oozy
green
runners
they
reminded
him
too
much
of
the
things
that
had
been
hanging
down
there
in
the
dark
he
rechecked
the
paper
kaspbrak
was
in
henry
started
down
that
way
running
one
hand
along
the
wall
for
support
leaving
a
faint
bloody
track
on
the
wallpaper
as
he
went
ah
but
he
stepped
away
whenever
he
came
close
to
one
of
the
hanging
spiderplants
he
wanted
no
truck
with
those
his
breathing
was
harsh
and
dry
here
it
was
henry
pulled
the
switchblade
from
his
pocket
svashed
his
dry
lips
with
his
tongue
and
knocked
on
the
door
nothing
he
knocked
again
louder
this
time
whozi
sleepy
good
he'd
be
in
his
jammies
only
halfawake
and
when
he
opened
the
door
henry
would
drive
the
switchblade
directly
into
the
hollow
at
the
base
of
his
neck
the
vulnerable
hollow
just
below
the
adam
apple
bellboy
sir
henry
said
message
from
your
wife
did
kaspbrak
have
a
wife
maybe
that
had
been
a
stupid
thing
to
say
he
waited
coldly
alert
he
heard
footsteps
the
shuffle
of
slippers
from
myra
he
sounded
alarmed
good
he
would
be
more
alarmed
in
a
few
seconds
a
pulse
beat
steadily
in
henry
right
temple
i
guess
so
sir
there
no
name
it
just
says
your
wife
there
was
a
pause
then
a
metallic
rattle
as
kaspbrak
fumbled
with
the
chain
grinning
henry
pushed
the
button
on
the
switchblade
handle
click
he
held
the
blade
up
by
his
cheek
ready
he
heard
the
thumbbolt
turn
in
just
a
moment
he
would
plunge
the
blade
into
the
skinny
litte
creep
throat
he
waited
the
door
opened
and
eddie
the
losers
all
together
/
p.m
saw
stan
and
richie
just
coming
out
of
the
costello
avenue
market
each
of
them
eating
a
rocket
on
a
pushup
stick
he
he
shouted
hey
wait
up
they
turned
around
and
stan
waved
eddie
ran
to
join
them
as
quickly
as
he
could
which
was
not
in
truth
very
quickly
one
arm
was
immured
in
a
plasterofparis
cast
and
he
had
his
parcheesi
board
under
the
other
whatchoo
say
eddie
whatchoo
say
boy
richie
asked
in
his
grandly
rolling
southern
gentleman
voice
the
one
that
sounded
more
like
foghorn
leghorn
in
the
warner
brothers
cartoons
than
anything
else
ah

eddie
said
a
little
out
of
breath
how
about
a
lick
on
your
rocket
your
mom
wouldn't
approve
eddie
richie
said
sadly
he
began
to
eat
faster
he
had
just
gotten
to
the
chocolate
stuff
in
the
middle
his
favorite
part
germs
boy
ah

eddie
said
reluctantly
richie
held
his
rocket
up
to
eddie
nouth
and
snatched
it
away
quickly
as
soon
as
eddie
had
gotten
in
a
couple
of
moderately
serious
licks
you
can
have
the
rest
of
mine
if
you
want
stan
said
t'm
still
full
from
lunch
jews
don't
eat
much
richie
instructed
it
part
of
their
religion
the
three
of
them
were
walking
along
companionably
enough
now
headed
up
toward
kansas
street
and
the
barrens
derry
seemed
lost
in
a
deep
hazy
afternoon
doze
the
blinds
of
most
of
the
houses
they
passed
were
pulled
down
toys
stood
abandoned
on
lawns
as
if
their
owners
had
been
hastily
called
in
from
play
or
put
down
for
naps
thunder
rumbled
thickly
in
the
west
ts
it
eddie
asked
stan
no
richie
just
pulling
your
leg
stan
said
jews
eat
as
much
as
normal
people
he
pointed
at
richie
like
him
you
know
you're
pretty
fucking
mean
to
stan
eddie
told
richie
how
would
you
like
somebody
to
say
all
that
madeup
shit
about
you
just
because
you're
a
catholic
oh
catholics
do
plenty
richie
said
my
dad
told
me
once
that
hitler
was
a
catholic
and
hitler
killed
billions
of
jews
right
stan
yeah
i
guess
s
stan
said
he
looked
embarrassed
my
mom
was
furious
when
my
dad
told
me
that
richie
went
on
a
little
reminiscent
grin
had
surfaced
on
his
face
absolutely
fyoorious
us
catholics
also
had
the
inquisition
that
was
the
little
dealie
with
the
rack
and
the
thumbscrews
and
all
that
stuff
i
figure
all
religions
are
pretty
weird
me
too
stan
said
quietly
we're
not
orthodox
or
anything
like
that
i
mean
we
eat
ham
and
bacon
i
hardly
even
know
what
being
a
jew
is
i
was
born
in
derry
and
sometimes
we
go
up
to
synagogue
in
bangor
for
stuff
like
yom
kippur
but
he
shrugged
ham
baco
eddie
was
mystified
he
and
his
mom
were
methodists
orthodox
jews
don't
eat
stuff
like
that
stan
said
it
says
something
in
the
torah
about
not
eating
anything
that
creeps
through
the
mud
or
walks
on
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
i
don't
know
exactly
how
it
goes
but
pigs
are
supposed
to
be
out
also
lobster
but
my
folks
eat
them
i
do
too
that
weird
eddie
said
and
burst
out
laughing
i
never
heard
of
a
religion
that
told
you
what
you
could
eat
next
thing
they'll
be
telling
you
what
kind
of
gas
you
can
buy
kosher
gas
stan
said
and
laughed
by
himself
neither
richie
nor
eddie
understood
what
he
was
laughing
about
you
gotta
admit
stanny
it
is
pretty
weird
richie
said
i
mean
not
being
able
to
eat
a
sausage
just
because
you
happen
to
be
jewish
yea
stan
said
you
eat
meat
on
fridays
jeez
n
richie
said
shocked
you
can't
eat
meat
on
friday
because
he
began
to
grin
a
little
oh
okay
i
see
what
you
mean
do
catholics
really
go
to
hell
if
they
eat
meat
on
fridays
edie
asked
fascinated
totally
unaware
that
until
two
generations
before
his
own
people
had
been
devout
polish
catholics
who
would
no
more
have
eaten
meat
on
friday
than
they
would
have
gone
outside
with
no
clothes
on
well
i'll
tell
you
what
eddie
richie
said
i
don't
really
think
god
would
send
me
down
to
the
hot
place
just
for
forgetting
and
having
a
baloney
sandwich
for
lunch
on
a
friday
but
why
take
a
chance
right
guess
not
eddie
said
but
it
seems
so
so
stupid
he
was
going
to
say
and
then
he
remembered
a
story
mrs
portleigh
had
told
the
sundayschool
class
when
he
was
just
a
little
kid
a
first
grader
in
little
worshippers
according
to
mrs
portleigh
a
bad
boy
had
once
stolen
some
of
the
communion
bread
when
the
tray
was
passed
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
he
took
it
home
and
threw
it
into
the
toilet
bowl
just
to
see
what
would
happen
at
once
or
so
mrs
portleigh
reported
to
her
rapt
little
worshippers
the
water
in
the
toilet
bowl
had
turned
a
bright
red
it
was
the
hood
of
christ
she
said
and
it
had
appeared
to
that
little
boy
because
he
had
done
a
very
bad
act
called
a
blasphemy
it
had
appeared
to
warn
him
that
by
throwing
the
flesh
of
jesus
into
the
toilet
he
had
put
his
immortal
soul
in
danger
of
hell
up
until
then
eddie
had
rather
enjoyed
the
act
of
communion
which
he
had
only
been
allowed
to
take
since
the
previous
year
the
methodists
used
welch
grape
juice
instead
of
wine
and
the
body
of
christ
was
represented
by
cutup
cubes
of
fresh
springy
wonder
bread
he
liked
the
idea
of
taking
in
food
and
drink
as
a
religious
rite
but
following
mrs
portleigh
story
his
awe
of
the
ritual
darkened
into
something
more
potent
something
rather
dreadful
simply
reaching
for
the
cubes
of
bread
became
an
act
vhich
required
courage
and
he
always
feared
an
electrical
shock
or
worse
that
the
bread
would
suddenly
change
color
in
his
hand
become
a
bloodclot
and
a
disembodied
voice
would
begin
to
thunder
in
the
church
not
worthy
not
worthy
damned
to
hell
damned
to
hell
often
after
he
had
taken
communion
his
throat
would
close
up
his
breath
would
begin
to
wheeze
in
and
out
and
he
would
wait
with
panicky
impatience
for
the
benediction
to
be
over
so
he
could
hurry
into
the
vestibule
and
use
his
aspirator
you
don't
want
to
be
so
silly
he
told
himself
as
he
grew
older
that
was
nothing
but
a
story
and
mrs
portleigh
sure
wasn't
any
saint
mamma
said
she
was
divorced
down
in
kittery
and
that
she
plays
bingo
at
saint
mary
in
bangor
and
that
real
christians
don't
gamble
real
christians
leave
gambling
for
pagans
and
catholics
all
that
made
perfect
sense
but
it
didn't
relieve
his
mind
the
story
of
the
communion
bread
that
turned
the
water
in
the
toilet
bowl
to
blood
worried
at
him
gnawed
at
him
even
caused
him
to
lose
sleep
it
came
to
him
one
night
that
the
way
to
get
this
behind
him
once
and
for
all
would
be
to
take
a
piece
of
the
bread
himself
toss
it
in
the
toilet
and
see
what
happened
but
such
an
experiment
was
far
beyond
his
courage
his
rational
mind
could
not
stand
against
that
sinister
image
of
the
blood
spreading
its
cloud
of
accusation
and
potential
damnation
in
the
water
it
could
not
stand
against
that
talismanic
magical
incantation
this
is
my
body
take
eat
this
is
my
blood
shed
for
you
and
for
many
no
he
had
never
made
the
experiment
guess
all
religions
are
weird
eddie
said
now
but
powerful
his
mind
added
almost
magical
or
was
that
blasphemy
he
began
to
think
about
the
thing
they
had
seen
on
neibolt
street
and
for
the
first
time
he
saw
a
crazy
parallel
the
werewolf
had
after
all
come
out
of
the
toilet
boy
i
guess
everybody
asleep
richie
said
tossing
his
empty
rocket
tube
nonchalantly
into
the
gutter

ever
see
it
so
quiet
what
did
everybody

he

richie
said
for
him
and
they
all
laughed
they
started
toward
the
barrens
again
mike
and
bill
pushing
their
bikes
conversation
was
brisk
at
first
but
then
it
lagged
looking
at
bill
eddie
saw
an
uneasy
look
on
his
face
and
he
thought
that
maybe
the
quiet
was
getting
to
him
too
he
knew
richie
had
meant
it
as
a
joke
but
it
really
did
seem
that
everyone
in
derry
had
gone
to
bar
harbor
for
the
day
to
somewhere
not
a
car
moved
on
the
street
there
wasn't
a
single
old
lady
pushing
a
carrier
full
of
groceries
back
to
her
house
or
apartment
sure
is
quiet
isn't
i
eddie
ventured
but
bill
only
nodded
they
crossed
to
the
barrens
side
of
kansas
street
and
then
they
saw
ben
and
beverly
running
toward
them
shouting
eddie
was
shocked
by
beverly
appearance
she
was
usually
so
neat
and
clean
her
hair
always
washed
and
tied
back
in
a
ponytail
now
she
was
streaked
with
what
looked
like
every
kind
of
gluck
in
the
universe
her
eyes
were
wide
and
wild
there
was
a
scratch
on
one
cheek
her
jeans
were
caked
with
crap
and
her
blouse
was
torn
ben
fell
behind
her
puffing
his
stomach
wobbling
can't
go
down
in
the
barrens
beverly
was
panting
the
boys

they're
down
there

dow
bill
said
taking
charge
at
once
in
that
effortless
almost
unconscious
way
of
his
he
glanced
at
ben
as
he
ran
up
his
cheeks
flushed
bright
his
considerable
chest
heaving
she
says
henry
gone
crazy
big
bill
ben
said
shit
you
mean
he
used
to
be
sane
'
richie
asked
and
spat
between
his
teeth
sh
shut
uhup
ruhrichi
bill
said
and
then
looked
back
at
beverly
tehtell
he
said
eddie
hand
crept
into
his
pocket
and
touched
his
aspirator
he
didn't
know
what
all
this
was
but
he
already
knew
it
wasn't
good
forcing
herself
to
speak
as
calmly
as
possible
beverly
managed
to
get
out
an
edited
version
of
the
story
a
version
that
began
with
henry
victor
and
belch
catching
up
to
her
on
the
street
she
didn't
tell
them
about
her
father
she
was
desperately
ashamed
of
that
when
she
was
finished
bill
stood
silent
for
a
moment
hands
in
his
pockets
chin
down
silver
handlebars
leaning
against
his
chest
the
others
waited
throwing
frequent
glances
at
the
railing
that
ran
along
the
edge
of
the
dropoff
bill
thought
for
a
long
time
and
no
one
interrupted
him
eddie
became
aware
suddenly
and
effortlessly
that
this
might
be
the
final
act
that
was
how
the
day
silence
felt
wasn't
it
the
feeling
that
the
whole
town
had
up
and
left
leaving
only
the
deserted
husks
of
buildings
behind
richie
was
thinking
about
the
picture
in
george
album
that
had
suddenly
come
to
life
beverly
was
thinking
about
her
father
how
pale
his
eyes
had
been
mike
was
thinking
about
the
bird
ben
was
thinking
about
the
mummy
and
a
smell
like
dead
cinnamon
stan
uris
was
thinking
of
bluejeans
black
and
dripping
and
hands
as
white
as
wrinkled
paper
also
dripping
cuhcuhcome

bill

said
his
face
was
troubled
beverly
said
henry
was
really
crazy
that
he
meant
to
kill
thit
nuhnot
theirs
bill
said
gesturing
at
the
green
daggershaped
slash
of
the
barrens
to
their
right
and
below
them
the
underbrush
the
choked
groves
of
trees
the
bamboo
the
glint
of
water
thihit
not
their
pruhpruhhoppert
he
looked
around
at
them
his
face
grim
tm
tttired
of
bbeing

by

we
bbbeat
them
in
the
rub
rockfight
and
if
we
hhhave

aaagain
we'll
dub
duh
do
it
but
bill
eddie
said
what
if
it
not
just
them
bill
turned
to
eddie
and
with
real
shock
eddie
saw
how
tired
and
drawn
bill
face
was
there
was
something
frightening
about
that
face
but
it
wasn't
until
much
much
later
as
an
adult
drifting
toward
sleep
after
the
meeting
at
the
library
that
he
understood
what
that
frightening
thing
was
it
was
the
face
of
a
boy
driven
close
to
the
brink
of
madness
a
boy
who
was
perhaps
ultimately
no
more
sane
or
in
control
of
his
own
decisions
than
henry
was
yet
the
essential
bill
was
still
there
looking
out
of
those
haunted
scarified
eyes
an
angry
determined
bill
wel
he
said
whuhwhuh
what
if
it
nuhnuhnot
no
one
answered
him
thunder
boomed
closer
now
eddie
looked
at
the
sky
and
saw
the
stormclouds
moving
in
from
the
west
in
black
thunderheads
it
was
going
to
rain
a
bitch
as
his
mother
sometimes
said
nuhnuhhow
i'll
tttell
you
what
bill
said
looking
at
them
none
of
you

quietly

ben

mike
said
with
a
shrug
beverly
and
stan
agreed
and
eddie
last
don't
think
so
eddie
richie
said
your
arm
not

eddie
looked
at

bill
said

bill
eddie
said
bill
tired
halfcrazy
face
seemed
suddenly
lovely
to
him
lovely
and
well
loved
he
felt
a
dim
sense
of
amazement
i'd
die
for
him
i
guess
if
he
told
me
to
what
kind
of
power
is
that
if
it
makes
you
look
like
bill
looks
now
it
maybe
not
such
a
good
power
to
have
yeah
bill
got
the
ultimate
weapon
richie
said
bo
bombs
he
raised
his
left
arm
and
fluttered
his
right
hand
under
the
exposed
armpit
ben
and
mike
laughed
a
little
and
eddie
smiled
thunder
boomed
again
close
and
loud
enough
this
time
to
make
them
jump
and
huddle
closer
together
the
wind
was
picking
up
rattling
trash
around
in
the
gutter
the
first
of
the
dark
clouds
sailed
over
the
hazy
ringed
disc
of
the
sun
and
their
shadows
melted
away
the
wind
was
cold
chilling
the
sweat
on
eddie
uncovered
arm
he
shivered
bill
looked
at
stan
and
said
a
peculiar
thing
then
you
got
your
bbbirdbook
stan
stan
tapped
his
hip
pocket
bill
looked
at
them
again
let
g
g
go
down
he
said
they
went
down
the
embankment
singlefile
except
for
bill
who
stayed
with
eddie
as
he
had
promised
he
allowed
richie
to
push
silver
down
and
when
they
had
reached
the
bottom
bill
put
his
bike
in
its
accustomed
place
under
the
bridge
then
they
stood
together
looking
around
the
coming
storm
did
not
produce
a
darkness
not
even
precisely
a
dimness
but
the
quality
of
the
light
had
changed
and
things
stood
out
in
a
kind
of
dreamlike
steely
relief
shadowless
clear
chiselled
eddie
felt
a
sinking
of
horror
and
apprehension
in
his
guts
as
he
realized
why
the
quality
of
this
light
seemed
so
familiar
it
was
the
same
sort
of
light
he
remembered
from
the
house
at
neibolt
street
a
streak
of
lightning
tattooed
the
clouds
bright
enough
to
make
him
wince
he
put
a
hand
up
to
his
face
and
found
himself
counting
one
two
three
and
then
the
thunder
came
in
a
single
coughing
bark
an
explosive
sound
a
sound
like
an
m
firecracker
and
they
drew
even
cbser
together
wasn't
any
rain
forecast
this
morning
ben
said
uneasily
the
paper
said
hot
and
hazy
mike
was
scanning
the
sky
the
clouds
up
there
were
blackbottomed
keelboats
high
and
heavy
swiftly
overrunning
the
blue
haze
that
had
covered
the
sky
from
horizon
to
horizon
when
he
and
bill
came
out
of
the
denbrough
house
after
lunch
comin
fast
he
said
never
saw
a
storm
come
so
fast
and
as
if
in
confirmation
thunder
whacked
again
cccome
on
bill
said
llet
put
eheheddie
parcheeheesi
board
in
the
cluhcluh
clubhouse
they
started
along
the
path
they
had
beaten
in
the
weeks
since
the
incident
of
the
dam
bill
and
eddie
were
at
the
head
of
the
line
their
shoulders
brushing
the
broad
green
leaves
of
the
shrubs
the
others
behind
them
the
wind
gusted
again
making
the
leaves
on
the
trees
and
bushes
whisper
together
farther
ahead
the
bamboo
rattled
eerily
like
drums
in
a
jungle
tale
bill
eddie
said
in
a
low
voice
what
i
thought
this
was
just
in
the
movies
but
eddie
laughed
a
little
i
feel
like
somebody
watching
me
oh
they're
thththere
all
rrrigh
bill
said
eddie
looked
around
nervously
and
held
his
parcheesi
board
a
link
tighter
he
eddie
room
/
a.m
opened
the
door
on
a
monster
from
a
horror
comic
a
gorestreaked
apparition
stood
there
and
it
could
only
be
henry
bowers
henry
looked
like
a
corpse
which
has
returned
from
the
grave
henry
face
was
a
frozen
witchdoctor
mask
of
hate
and
murder
his
right
hand
was
cocked
at
cheeklevel
and
even
as
eddie
eyes
widened
and
he
began
to
draw
in
his
first
shocked
breath
the
hand
pistoned
forward
the
switchblade
glittering
like
silk
with
no
thought
there
was
no
time
if
he
had
stopped
to
think
he
would
have
died
eddie
slammed
the
door
closed
it
struck
henry
forearm
deflecting
the
knife
course
so
that
it
swung
in
a
savage
sidetoside
arc
less
than
an
inch
from
eddie
neck
there
was
a
crunch
as
the
door
pinched
henry
arm
against
the
jamb
henry
uttered
a
muffled
cry
his
hand
opened
the
knife
clattered
to
the
floor
eddie
kicked
it
it
skittered
under
the
tv
henry
threw
his
weight
against
the
door
he
outweighed
eddie
by
over
a
hundred
pounds
and
eddie
was
driven
back
like
a
doll
his
knees
struck
the
bed
and
he
fell
on
it
henry
came
into
the
room
and
swept
the
door
shut
behind
him
he
twisted
the
thumbbolt
as
eddie
sat
up
wideeyed
his
throat
already
starting
to
whistle
okay
fag
henry
said
his
ges
dropped
momentarily
to
the
floor
hunting
for
the
knife
he
didn't
see
it
eddie
groped
on
the
nighttable
and
found
one
of
the
two
bottles
of
perrier
water
he
had
ordered
earlier
that
day
this
was
the
full
one
he
had
drunk
the
other
before
going
to
the
library
because
his
nerves
were
shot
and
he
had
a
bad
case
of
acidburn
perrier
was
very
good
for
the
digestion
as
henry
dismissed
the
knife
and
started
toward
him
eddie
gripped
the
green
pearshaped
bottle
by
the
neck
and
smashed
it
on
the
edge
of
the
nighttable
perrier
foamed
and
fizzed
across
it
flooding
out
most
of
the
pillbottles
that
stood
there
henry
shut
and
pants
were
heavy
with
blood
both
fresh
and
semidried
his
right
hand
now
hung
at
a
strange
angle
babyfa
henry
said
teach
you
to
throw
rocks
he
made
it
to
the
bed
and
reached
for
eddie
who
still
hardly
realized
what
was
happening
no
more
than
forty
seconds
had
elapsed
since
he
had
opened
the
door
henry
grabbed
for
him
eddie
thrust
the
ragged
base
of
the
perrier
bottle
at
him
it
ripped
into
henry
face
pulling
open
his
right
cheek
in
a
twisted
flap
and
puncturing
henry
right
eye
henry
uttered
a
breathless
scream
and
staggered
backward
his
slit
eye
leaking
whitish
yellow
fluid
hung
loosely
from
its
socket
his
cheek
sprayed
blood
in
a
gaudy
fountain
eddie
own
cry
was
louder
he
got
off
the
bed
and
went
toward
henry
to
help
him
perhaps
he
wasn't
really
sure
and
henry
lurched
at
him
again
eddie
thrust
with
the
perrier
bottle
as
if
with
a
fencing
sword
and
this
time
the
jagged
points
of
green
glass
punched
deep
into
henry
left
hand
and
sawed
at
his
fingers
fresh
blood
flowed
henry
made
a
thick
grunting
noise
the
sound
almost
of
a
man
clearing
his
throat
and
shoved
eddie
with
his
right
hand
eddie
flew
back
and
struck
the
writingdesk
his
left
arm
twisted
behind
him
somehow
and
he
fell
on
it
heavily
the
pain
was
a
sudden
sickening
flare
he
felt
the
bone
go
along
the
faultline
of
that
old
break
and
he
had
to
clench
his
teeth
against
a
scream
of
agony
a
shadow
blotted
out
the
light
henry
bowers
was
standing
over
him
swaying
back
and
forth
his
knees
buckled
his
left
hand
was
dripping
blood
on
the
front
of
eddie
robe
eddie
had
held
onto
the
stump
of
the
perrier
bottle
and
now
as
henry
knees
came
completely
unhinged
he
got
it
in
front
of
him
jagged
base
pointing
upward
the
cap
braced
against
his
sternum
henry
came
down
like
a
tree
impaling
himself
on
the
bottle
eddie
felt
it
shatter
in
his
hand
and
a
fresh
bolt
of
grinding
agony
shuddered
through
his
left
arm
which
was
still
trapped
under
his
body
fresh
warmth
cascaded
over
him
he
wasn't
sure
if
this
batch
was
henry
blood
or
his
henry
twitched
like
a
landed
trout
his
shoes
rattled
an
almost
syncopated
beat
on
the
carpet
eddie
could
smell
his
rotten
breath
then
henry
stiffened
and
rolled
over
the
bottle
protruded
grotesquely
from
his
midsection
capped
end
pointing
toward
the
ceiling
as
if
it
had
grown
there
gu
henry
said
and
said
no
more
he
looked
up
at
the
ceiling
eddie
thought
he
might
be
dead
eddie
fought
off
the
waves
of
faintness
that
wanted
to
cover
him
over
and
drag
him
down
he
got
to
his
knees
and
finally
to
his
feet
there
was
fresh
pain
as
his
broken
arm
swung
out
in
front
of
him
and
that
cleared
his
head
a
little
wheezing
fighting
for
breath
he
made
it
to
the
nighttable
he
picked
his
aspirator
out
of
a
puddle
of
carbonated
water
stuck
it
in
his
mouth
and
triggered
it
off
he
shuddered
at
the
taste
then
gave
himself
another
blast
he
looked
around
at
the
body
on
the
carpet
could
that
be
henry
could
it
possibly
be
it
was
grown
old
his
crewcut
more
gray
than
black
his
body
now
fat
and
white
and
sluglike
it
was
still
henry
and
henry
was
dead
at
long
last
henry
was
gu
henry
said
and
sat
up
his
hands
clawed
at
the
air
as
if
for
holds
which
only
henry
could
see
his
gouged
eye
leaked
and
dribbled
its
bottom
arc
now
bulged
pregnantly
down
onto
his
cheek
he
looked
around
saw
eddie
shrinking
back
against
the
wall
and
tried
to
get
up
he
opened
his
mouth
and
a
stream
of
blood
gushed
out
henry
collapsed
again
heart
racing
eddie
fumbled
for
the
telephone
and
succeeded
only
in
knocking
it
off
the
table
and
onto
the
bed
he
snatched
it
up
and
dialed
the
phone
rang
again
and
again
and
again
come
on
eddie
thought
what
are
you
doing
down
there
jacking
off
come
on
please
answer
the
frigging
phone
it
rang
again
and
again
eddie
kept
his
eyes
on
henry
expecting
him
to
start
trying
to
gain
his
feet
again
at
any
moment
blood
dear
god
so
much
blood
desk
a
fuzzy
resentful
voice
said
at
last
ring
mr
denbrough
room
eddie
said
quick
as
you
can
with
his
other
ear
he
was
now
listening
to
the
rooms
around
him
how
loud
had
they
been
was
someone
going
to
pound
on
the
door
and
ask
if
everything
was
all
right
in
there
you
sure
you
want
me
to
ring
the
clerk
asked
it
ten
after
three
yes
do
it
eddie
nearly
screamed
the
hand
holding
the
phone
was
trembling
in
convulsive
little
bursts
there
was
a
nest
of
waspy
rottenugly
singing
in
his
other
arm
had
henry
moved
again
no
surely
not
okay
oka
the
clerk
said
cool
your
jets
my
friend
there
was
a
click
and
then
the
hoarse
burr
of
a
roomphone
ringing
come
on
bill
come
on
c
a
sudden
thought
gruesomely
plausible
occurred
to
him
suppose
henry
had
visited
bill
room
first
or
richie
ben
bev
or
had
henry
perhaps
paid
a
visit
to
the
library
surely
he
had
been
somewhere
else
first
if
someone
hadn't
softened
henry
up
it
would
have
been
eddie
lying
dead
on
the
floor
with
a
switchblade
growing
out
of
his
chest
the
way
the
neck
of
the
perrier
bottle
was
growing
out
of
henry
gut
or
suppose
henry
had
visited
all
the
others
first
catching
them
bleary
and
halfasleep
as
henry
had
caught
him
suppose
they
were
all
dead
and
that
thought
was
so
awful
eddie
believed
he
would
soon
begin
screaming
if
someone
didn't
answer
the
phone
in
bill
room
please
big
bill
eddie
whispered
please
be
there
man
the
phone
was
picked
up
and
bill
voice
uncharacteristically
cautious
said
hhhello
bill
eddie
said
almost
babbled
bill
thank
god
eddie
bill
voice
grew
momentarily
fainter
speaking
to
someone
else
telling
the
someone
who
it
was
then
he
was
back
strong
w
what
the
muh
hatter
eddie
it
henry
bowers
eddie
said
he
looked
at
the
body
on
the
floor
again
had
it
changed
position
this
time
it
was
not
so
easy
to
persuade
himself
it
hadn't
bill
he
came
here
and
i
killed
him
he
had
a
knife
i
think
he
lowered
his
voice
i
think
it
was
the
same
knife
he
had
that
day
when
we
went
into
the
sewers
do
you
remember
irrremembe
bill
said
grimly
eddie
listen
to
me
i
want
you
to
the
barrens
/
p.m
g
g
go
back
and
tell
bbben
to
ccome
up
+i
here
okay
eddie
said
and
dropped
back
at
once
they
were
approaching
the
clearing
now
thunder
rumbled
in
the
overcast
sky
and
the
bushes
sighed
in
the
rising
breeze
ben
joined
him
as
they
came
into
the
clearing
the
trapdoor
to
the
clubhouse
stood
open
an
improbable
square
of
blackness
in
the
green
the
sound
of
the
river
was
very
clear
and
bill
was
suddenly
struck
by
a
crazy
certainty
that
he
was
experiencing
that
sound
and
this
place
for
the
last
time
in
his
childhood
he
drew
a
deep
breath
smelling
earth
and
air
and
the
distant
sooty
dump
fuming
like
a
sullen
volcano
that
cannot
quite
make
up
its
mind
to
erupt
he
saw
a
flock
of
birds
fly
off
the
railroad
trestle
and
toward
the
old
cape
he
looked
up
at
the
boiling
clouds
what
is
it
ben
asked
why
hhhaven't
they
tried
to
guhguhhet
uus
bill
asked
they're
ththere
eheh
eddie
was
ruh
hight
about
that
i
can
fuhfuhheel
them
yeah
ben
said
i
guess
they
might
be
stupid
enough
to
think
we're
going
back
into
the
clubhouse
then
they'd
have
us
trapped
muhmuhmayb
bill
said
and
he
felt
a
sudden
helpless
fury
at
his
stutter
which
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
talk
fast
perhaps
they
were
things
he
would
have
found
impossible
to
say
anyway
how
he
felt
he
could
almost
see
through
henry
bowers
eyes
how
he
felt
that
although
on
opposite
sides
pawns
controlled
by
opposing
forces
he
and
henry
had
grown
very
close
henry
expected
them
to
stand
and
fight
it
expected
them
to
stand
and
fight
and
be
killed
a
chilly
explosion
of
white
light
seemed
to
fill
his
head
they
would
be
victims
of
the
killer
that
had
been
stalking
derry
ever
since
george
death
all
seven
of
them
perhaps
their
bodies
would
be
found
perhaps
not
it
all
depended
on
whether
or
not
it
could
or
would
protect
henry
and
to
a
lesser
degree
belch
and
victor
yes
to
the
outside
to
the
rest
of
this
town
we'll
have
been
victims
of
the
killer
and
that
right
in
a
funny
sort
of
way
that
really
is
right
it
wants
us
dead
henry
the
tool
to
get
it
done
so
it
doesn't
have
to
come
out
me
first
i
think
beverly
and
richie
might
be
able
to
hold
the
others
or
mike
but
stan
scared
and
so
ben
although
i
think
he
stronger
than
stan
and
eddie
got
a
broken
arm
why
did
i
lead
them
down
here
christ
why
did
i
bill
ben
said
anxiously
the
others
joined
them
beside
the
clubhouse
thunder
whacked
again
and
the
bushes
began
to
rustle
more
urgently
the
bamboo
rattled
on
in
the
fading
stormy
light
bill
it
was
richie
now
shhh
the
others
fell
uneasily
silent
under
his
blazing
haunted
eyes
he
stared
at
the
underbrush
at
the
path
twisting
away
through
it
and
back
toward
kansas
street
and
felt
his
mind
suddenly
go
up
another
notch
as
if
to
a
higher
plane
there
was
no
stuttering
in
his
mind
he
felt
as
if
his
thoughts
had
been
borne
away
on
a
mad
flow
of
intuition
as
if
everything
were
coming
to
him
george
at
one
end
me
and
my
friends
at
the
other
and
then
it
will
stop
again
again
yes
again
because
this
has
happened
before
and
there
always
has
to
be
some
sacrifice
at
the
end
some
terrible
thing
to
stop
it
i
don't
know
how
i
can
know
that
but
i
do
..and
they

mike
stood
on

intensely
as

his

they

they
always
do

my

those

thought
of
lunch
with
bill
bill
mother
had
been
off
in
her
own
dreamy
world
seeming
not
to
see
either
of
them
reading
a
henry
james
novel
while
the
boys
made
sandwiches
and
gobbled
them
standing
at
the
counter
richie
thought
of
stan
neat
but
utterly
empty
house
stan
had
been
a
little
surprised
his
mother
was
almost
always
home
at
lunch
time
on
the
few
occasions
when
she
wasn't
she
left
a
note
saying
where
she
could
be
reached
but
there
had
been
no
note
today
the
car
was
gone
and
that
was
all
probably
went
shopping
with
her
friend
debbie
stan
said
frowning
a
little
and
had
set
to
work
making
eggsalad
sandwiches
richie
had
forgotten
about
it
until
now
eddie
thought
of
his
mother
when
he
had
gone
out
with
his
parcheesi
board
there
had
been
mwne
of
the
usual
cautions
be
careful
eddie
get
under

if
it

eddie
don't
you
dare
play
any
rough
games
eddie
she
hadn't
asked
if
he
had
his
aspirator
hadn't
told
him
what
time
to
be
home
hadn't
warned
him
against
those
rough
boys
you
phy
with
she
had
simply
gone
on
watching
her
soapopera
story
on
tv
as
if
he
didn't
exist
as
if
he
didn't
exist
a
version
of
the
same
thought
went
through
all
of
the
boys
minds
they
had
at
some
point
between
getting
up
this
morning
and
lunch
time
simply
become
ghosts

own
different
vision
of

ben
saw

which
suddenly
became
maneating
plants
beverly
saw
flying
leeches
like
the
ones
that
had
come
out
of
that
old
refrigerator
stan
saw
the
mucky
ground
in
the
bamboo
vomiting
up
the
living
corpses
of

caught
in

with

suddenly
boiling
out
of

cleft
of

tree
attacking

to
pieces
richie
saw
the
crawling
eye
oozing
down
on
top
of
them
as
they
ran
under
the
railroad
trestle
and
eddie
saw
them
climbing
the
old
cape
embankment
only
to
look
up
and
see
the
leper
standing
at
the
top
his
sagging
flesh
acrawl
with
beetles
and
maggots
waiting
for
them
if
we
could

then
winced
as
thunder
shouted
a
furious
negative
from
the
sky
more
rain
fell
it
was
still
only
squalling
but
soon
it
would
begin
to
come
down
seriously
in
sheets
and
torrents
the
day
hazy
peace
was
now
utterly
gone
as
if
it
had
never
been
at
all
we'd
be
safe
if
we
could
just
get
out
of
this
fucking

beverly
began
beepb
and
then
a
rock
came
flying
out
of
the
shaggy
bushes
and
struck
mike
on
the
side
of
the
head
he
staggered
backward
blood
flowing
through
the
tight
cap
of
his
hair
and
would
have
fallen
if
bill
hadn't
caught
him

mockingly
to

two

the

for

bill
saw

somehow
frightened
drugged
and
avid
all
at
the

then
a
rock
smashed
into

and
it
was

to
keep

from
falling
down
for
a
moment
he
couldn't

straight
his
cheek
felt
numb
then
sensation
returned
in
painful
throbs
and
he
felt
blood
running
down
his
face
he
swiped
at
his
cheek
wincing
at
the
painful
knob
that
was
rising

were
supposed
to
go
to

ben
stood
there
for
a
moment
wetting
his
lips
looking
at
bill
then
he
struck
off
across
the
clearing
heading
toward
the
river
a
brilliant
bolt
of
lightning
streaked
across
the
sky
purplishwhite
followed
by
a
rip
of
thunder
that
made
bill
reel
on
his

a

chunk
of

past

nose
and
struck

he
yipped
with

his

cried
in
that

the

now
he

flipped
over

and
struck

he

clapped

to
the
spot

and
as
the

of
he
losers
ran
after
ben

victor
and
belch
appeared
henry
stood
up
and
the
three
of
them
gave
chase
even
later
when
the
rest
of
that
day
had
come
back
to
ben
he
recalled
only
jumbled
images
of
their
run
through
the
bushes
he
remembered
branches
overloaded
with
dripping
leaves
slapping
against
his
face
dousing
him
with
cold
water
he
remembered
that
the
thunder
and
lightning
seemed
to
have
become
almost
constant
and
he
remembered
that
henry
screams
for
them
to
come
back
and
fight
seemed
to
merge
with
the
sound
of
the
kenduskeag
as
they
drew
closer
to
it
every
time
he
slowed
bill
would
whack
him
on
the
back
to
make
him
hurry
up
what
if
i
can't
find
it
what
if
i
can't

that
particular

the
breath
tore
in
and
out
of
his
lungs
hot
and
bloody
tasting
in
the
back
of
his
throat
a
stitch
was
sinking
into
his
side
his
buttocks
sang
where
the
rock
had
hit
him
beverly
had
said
henry
and
his
friends
meant
to
kill
them
and
ben
believed
it
now
yes
he
did
he
cane
to
the
kenduskeag
bank
so
suddenly
that
he
nearly
plunged
over
the
edge
he
managed
to
get
his
balance
and
then
the
embankment
undercut
by
the
spring
runoff
collapsed
and
he
went
tumbling
over
anyway
skidding
all
the
way
to
the
edge
of
the
fast
running
water
his
shirt
rucking
up
in
the
back
clayey
mud
streaking
and
sticking
to
his
skin

piled
into
him
and
yanked
him
to
his
feet

out
of
the
bushes

overhung

bank

after
the
other

suicidally
short

river
seemed
higher
already
and
the
raindark
sky
had
given
it
a
dangerous
slategray
color
as
it
boiled
its
way
along
its
banks
were
choked
with
underbrush
and
stunted
trees
all
of
them
now
dancing
to
the
wind
tune
he
could
hear
eddie
sobbing
for
breath
wuhwuhwhere
'
i
don't
kn
he
began
and
then
he
saw
the
leaning
tree
and
the
eroded
cave
beneath
it
that
was
where
he
had
hidden
that
first
day
he
had
dozed
off
and
when
he
woke
up
he
had
heard
bill
and
eddie
goofing
around
then
the
big
boys
had
come
seen
conquered
tata
bays
it
was
a
real
baby
dam
believe
me
there
he
shouted
that
way
lightning
flashed
again
and
this
time
ben
could
hear
it
a
buzzing
noise
like
an
overloaded
lionel
traintransformer
it
struck
the
tree
and
bluewhite
electric
fire
sizzled
its
gnarly
base
into
splinters
and
toothpicks
sized
for
a
fairytale
giant
it
fell
toward
the
river
with
a
rending
crash
driving
spray
high
into
the
air
ben
drew
in
a
dismayed
gasp
and
smelled
something
hot
and
punky
and
wild
a
fireball
rolled
up
the
bole
of
the
downed
tree
seemed
to
flash
brighter
and
went
out
thunder
exploded
not
above
them
but
around
them
as
if
they
stood
in
the
center
of
the
thunderclap
the
rain
sheeted
down
bill
thumped
him
on
the
back
awaking
him
from
his
dazed
contemplation
of
these
things
guhguhg
ben
went
splashing
and
stumbling
along
the
verge
of
the
river
his
hair
hanging
in
his
eyes
he
reached
the
tree
the
little
rootcave
beneath
it
had
been
obliterated
and
climbed
over
it
digging
his
toes
into
its
wet
hide
scraping
his
hands
and
forearms
bill
and
richie
manhandled
eddie
over
and
as
he
stumbled
off
the
treetrunk
ben
caught
him
they
both
went
tumbling
to
the
ground
eddie
cried
out
you
all
right
ben
shouted
i
guess
so
eddie
shouted
back
getting
to
his
feet
he
fumbled
for
his
aspirator
and
almost
dropped
it
ben
grabbed
it
for
him
and
eddie
gave
him
a
grateful
look
as
he
stuffed
it
into
his
mouth
and
triggered
it
richie
came
over
then
stan
and
mike
bill
boosted
beverly
up
onto
the
tree
and
ben
and
richie
caught
her
coming
down
on
the
far
side
her
hair
plastered
to
her
head
her
blue
jeans
now
black
bill
came
last
pulling
himself
onto
the
trunk
and
swinging
his
legs
around
he
saw
henry
and
the
other
two
splashing
down
the
river
toward
them
and
as
he
slid
off
the
fallen
tree
he
shouted
ruhruhrocks
throw
rock
there
were
plenty
of
them
here
on
the
bank
and
the
lightningstruck
tree
made
a
perfect
barricade
in
a
moment
or
two
all
seven
of
them
were
chucking
rocks
at
henry
and
his
pals
they
had
nearly
reached
the
tree
the
range
was
pointblank
they
were
driven
back
yelling
with
pain
and
fury
as
rocks
struck
their
faces
their
chests
their
arms
and
legs
teach
us
to
throw
rocks
richie
shouted
and
chucked
one
the
size
of
a
hen
egg
at
victor
it
struck
his
shoulder
and
bounced
almost
straight
up
into
the
air
victor
howled
ah
say
ah
say
go
on
an
teach
us
boy
we
learn
good”
yeeeehaaaa
mike
screamed
how
do
you
like
it
how
do
you
like
it
the
answer
was
not
much
they
retreated
until
they
were
out
of
range
and
huddled
together
a
moment
later
they
climbed
the
bank
slipping
and
stumbling
on
the
slick
wet
earth
which
was
already
honeycombed
with
little
running
streamlets
holding
onto
branches
to
stay
upright
they
disappeared
into
the
underbrush
they're
gonna
go
around
us
big
bill
richie
said
pushing
his
glasses
up
on
his
nose
that
oh
oboka
bill
said
ggo
on
bbben
we'll
fuhfuh
follow
y
you
ben
trotted
along
the
embankment
paused
expecting
that
henry
and
the
others
would
burst
out
into
his
face
at
any
moment
and
saw
the
pumpingstation
twenty
yards
farther
down
the
streambed
the
others
followed
him
to
it
they
could
see
other
cylinders
on
the
opposite
bank
one
fairly
close
the
other
forty
yards
upstream
those
two
were
both
shooting
torrents
of
muddy
water
into
the
kenduskeag
but
only
a
trickle
was
coming
from
the
pipe
sticking
out
of
the
embankment
below
this
one
it
wasn't
humming
either
ben
noticed
the
pumping
machinery
had
broken
down
he
looked
at
bill
thoughtfully
and
with
some
fright
bill
was
looking
at
richie
stan
and
mike
wwwe
¢guhhotta
get
the
hid
ohobof
he
said
hhhelp
mmme
there
were
handholds
in
the
iron
but
the
rain
had
made
them
slippery
and
the
lid
itself
was
incredibly
heavy
ben
moved
in
next
to
bill
and
bill
shifted
his
hands
a
little
to
make
room
ben
could
hear
water
dripping
inside
an
echoey
unpleasant
sound
like
water
dripping
into
a
well
nuhnuhno
bill
shouted
and
the
five
of
them
heaved
in
unison
the
lid
moved
with
an
ugly
grating
sound
beverly
grabbed
on
beside
richie
and
eddie
pushed
with
hs
good
arm
one
two
three
push
richie
chanted
the
lid
grated
a
little
farther
off
the
top
of
the
cylinder
now
a
crescent
of
darkness
showed
one
two
three
pus
the
crescent
fattened

ben
shoved
until
red
spots
danced
in
front
of
his
eyes
stand
back
mike
shouted
there
it
goes
there
it
goes
they
stood
away
and
watched
as
the
big
circular
cap
overbalanced
then
fell
it
dug
a
slash
in
the
wet
earth
and
landed
upside
down
like
an
oversized
checker
beetles
scurried
off
its
surface
and
into
the
matted
grass
uc
eddie
said
bill
peered
inside
iron
rungs
descended
to
a
circular
pool
of
black
water
its
surface
now
pocked
with
raindrops
the
silent
pump
brooded
in
the
middle
of
this
halfsubmerged
he
could
see
water
flowing
into
the
pumpingstation
from
the
mouth
of
its
inflow
pipe
and
with
a
sinking
in
his
guts
he
thought
that
where
we
have
to
go
in
there
eh
eh
eheddie
ggrab
on
to

eddie
looked
at
him
uncomprehending
like
a
puh
puhpigger
back

gg
good

he
demonstrated
eddie
understood
but
was
reluctant
quick
bill
snapped
thththey'll
bbbe
her
eddie
grabbed
on
around
bill
neck
stan
and
mike
boosted
him
up
so
he
could
hook
his
legs
around
bill
midsection
as
bill
swung
clumsily
over
the
lip
of
the
cylinder
ben
saw
that
eddie
eyes
were
tightly
shut
over
the
rain
he
could
hear
another
sound
whipping
branches
snapping
twigs
voices
henry
victor
and
belch
the
world
ugliest
cavalry
charge
bill
gripped
the
rough
concrete
lip
of
the
cylinder
and
felt
his
way
down
step
by
careful
step
the
iron
rungs
were
slippery
eddie
had
him
in
what
was
almost
a
deathgrip
and
bill
supposed
he
was
getting
a
pretty
graphic
demonstration
of
what
eddie
asthma
was
really
all
about
tm
scared
bill
eddie
whispered
lei
am
too
he
let
go
of
the
concrete
rim
and
grabbed
the
topmost
rung
although
eddie
was
nearly
choking
him
and
felt
as
if
he
had
already
gained
forty
pounds
bill
paused
a
moment
looking
at
the
barrens
the
kenduskeag
the
racing
clouds
a
voice
inside
not
a
frightened
voice
just
a
firm
one
had
told
him
to
take
a
good
look
in
case
he
never
saw
the
upper
world
ain
e
so
he
looked
then
began
to
descend
with
eddie
clinging
to
his
back
i
can't
hold
on
much
longe
eddie
managed
you
wwwon't
have
bill
said
we're
almost
duhhown
one
of
his
feet
went
into
chilly
water
he
felt
for
the
next
rung
and
found
it
there
was
another
below
that
and
then
the
ladder
ended
he
was
standing
in
kneedeep
water
beside
the
pump
he
squatted
wincing
as
the
cold
water
soaked
his
pants
and
let
eddie
off
he
drew
a
deep
breath
the
smell
wasn't
so
hot
but
it
was
great
not
to
have
eddie
arm
wrapped
around
his
throat
he
looked
up
at
the
cylinder
mouth
it
was
about
ten
feet
over
his
head
the
others
were
grouped
around
the
rim
looking
down
cccome
o
he
shouted
wuhone
at
a
tttime
be
quick
beverly
came
first
swinging
easily
over
the
rim
and
grabbing
the
ladder
and
stan
next
the
others
followed
richie
came
last
pausing
to
listen
to
the
progress
of
henry
and
friends
he
thought
from
the
sound
of
their
blundering
progress
that
they
would
probably
pass
a
little
to
the
left
of
this
pumpingstation
but
almost
certainly
not
by
enough
to
make
a
difference
at
that
moment
victor
bellowed
henry
there
tozie
richie
looked
around
and
saw
them
rushing
toward
him
victor
was
in
the
lead
and
then
henry
pushed
him
aside
so
savagely
that
victor
skidded
to
his
knees
henry
had
a
knife
all
right
a
regular
pigsticker
drops
of
water
were
falling
from
the
blade
richie
glanced
into
the
cylinder
saw
ben
ad
stan
helping
mike
off
the
ladder
and
swung
over
himself
henry
understood
what
he
was
doing
and
screamed
at
him
richie
laughing
crazily
slammed
his
left
hand
in
the
crook
of
his
right
elbow
and
stuck
his
forearm
skyward
his
hand
fisted
in
what
may
be
the
world
oldest
gesture
to
be
sure
henry
got
the
point
he
popped
his
middle
finger
up
you'll
die
down
there
henry
shouted
prove
it
richie
shouted
laughing
he
was
terrified
of
going
into
this
concrete
throat
but
he
still
couldn't
stop
laughing
and
in
his
irish
cop
voice
he
bugled
sure
an
begorrah
the
luck
of
the
irish
never
runs
out
me
foine
lad
henry
slipped
on
the
wet
grass
and
went
sprawling
on
his
butt
less
than
twenty
feet
from
where
richie
stood
his
feet
on
the
top
rung
of
the
ladder
bolted
to
the
inner
curve
of
the
pumping
station
his
head
and
chest
out
hey
bananaheel
richie
shouted
delirious
with
triumph
and
then
scooted
down
the
ladder
the
iron
rungs
were
slick
and
once
he
almost
fell
then
bill
and
mike
grabbed
him
and
he
was
standing
up
to
his
knees
in
water
with
the
rest
of
them
in
a
loose
circle
around
the
pump
he
was
trembling
all
over
he
felt
hot
and
cold
chills
chasing
each
other
up
his
back
and
still
he
couldn't
stop
laughing
you
should
have
seen
him
big
bill
clumsy
as
ever
still
can't
get
out
of
his
own
frockin
way
henry
head
appeared
in
the
circular
opening
at
the
top
scratches
from
branches
and
brambles
crisscrossed
his
cheeks
his
mouth
was
working
and
his
eyes
blazed
okay
he
shouted
down
at
them
his
words
had
a
flat
resonance
inside
the
concrete
cylinder
not
quite
an
echo
here
i
come
got
you
now
he
swung
one
leg
over
felt
for
the
topmost
rung
with
his
foot
found
it
swung
the
other
one
over
speaking
loud

ben
said
stan
tipped
a
wink
at
eddie
who
didn't
understand
what
was
going
on
except
it
seemed
to
him
that
richie
had
gone
crazy
he
was
laughing
like
a
loon
while
henry
bowers
the
dreaded
henry
bowers
prepared
to
come
down
and
kill
them
all
like
rats
in
a
rain
barrel
all
ready
for
him
bill
stan
cried
henry
froze
three
rungs
down
he
looked
down
at
the
losers
over
his
shoulder
his
face
seemed
for
the
first
time
doubtful
eddie
suddenly
got
it
if
hey
came
down
they
would
have
to
come
one
at
a
time
it
was
too
high
to
jump
especially
with
the
pumping
machinery
to
land
on
and
here
they
were
the
seven
of
them
waiting
in
a
tight
little
circle
cuhcuhhome
obon
hhenry
bill
said
pleasantly
wuhwuhwhat

sweetly

it
when

here
but
come
on
if
you
want
to
unless
you're
chicken
ben
added
he
began
to
make
chicken
sounds
richie
joined
him
at
once
and
soon
all
of
them
were
doing
it
the
derisive
clucking
rebounded
between
the
damp
trickling
walls
henry
looked
down
at
them
the
knife
clutched
in
his
left
hand
his
face
the
color
of
old
bricks
he
put
up
with
perhaps
thirty
seconds
of
it
and
then
climbed
out
again
the
losers
sent
up
catcalls
and
insults
oo
okay
bill
said
he
spoke
in
a
lower
voice
wwe

to
get

tat
druhhain
quhquh
quick
wh
beverly
asked
but
bill
was
spared
the
effort
of
an
answer
henry
reappeared
at
the
rim
of
the
pumpingstation
and
dropped
a
rock
the
size
of
a
soccer
ball
into
the
pipe
beverly
screamed
and
stan
pulled
eddie
against
the
circular
wall
with
a
hoarse
yell
the
rock
struck
the
pumping
machinery
rusty
housing
and
produced
a
musical
bonggg
it
ricocheted
left
and
struck
the
concrete
wall
missing
eddie
by
less
than
half
a
foot
a
chip
of
concrete
flicked
painfully
against
his
cheek
the
rock
fell
into
the
water
with
a
splash
'quhquhquic
bill
shouted
again
and
they
crowded
around
the
pumping
station
inflow
pipe
its
bore
was
about
five
feet
in
diameter
bill
sent
them
in
one
after
another
a
vague
circus
image
all
the
big
clowns
coming
out
of
the
little
car
passed
across
his
consciousness
in
a
meteoric
flash
years
later
he
would
use
the
same
image
in
a
book
called
the
black
rapids
and
climbed
in
last
after
ducking
another
rock
as
they
watched
more
rocks
flew
down
most
striking
the
pump
housing
and
rebounding
at
crazy
angles
when
they
stopped
falling
bill
looked
out
and
saw
henry
coming
down
the
ladder
again
as
quick
as
he
could
ggget
hhhi
he
shouted
to
the
others
richie
ben
and
mke
floundered
out
behind
bill
richie
leaped
high
and
grabbed
henry
ankle
henry
cursed
and
shook
his
leg
as
if
trying
to
kick
away
a
small
dog
with
big
teeth
a
terrier
perhaps
or
a
pekinese
richie
grabbed
a
rung
scrabbled
up
even
higher
and
actually
did
manage
to
sink
his
teeth
into
henry
ankle
henry
screamed
and
pulled
himself
up
quickly
one
of
his
loafers
came
off
and
splashed
into
the
water
where
it
sank
with
no
ado
at
all
bit
me
henry
was
screaming
bit

them
back

stone
age
bash
their
brains
in
more
rocks
flew
the
boys
backed
into
the
drain
again
quickly
mike
was
struck
on
the
arm
by
a
small
rock
and
he
held
it
tight
wincing
until
the
pain
began
to
abate
it
a
standoff
ben
said
they
can't
get
down
and
we
can't
get

said
quietly

they
looked
at

their
eyes
hurt
and
afraid
no

said
anything
henry
voice
fury
masquerading
as
mockery
floated
down
we
can
wait
up
here
all
day
you
guys
beverly
had
turned
away
and
was
looking
back
along
the
bore
of
the
inflow
pipe
the
light
grew
diffuse
quickly
and
she
could
not
see
much
what
she
could
see
was
a
concrete
tunnel
its
lower
third
filled
with
rushing
water
it
was
higher
on
her
now
than
it
had
been
when
they
first
squeezed
in
here
she
realized
that
would
be
because
this
pump
wasn't
working
and
only
some
of
the
water
was
exiting
on
the
kenduskeag
side
she
felt
claustrophobia
touch
her
throat
turning
the
skin
there
to
something
that
felt
like
flannel
if
he
water
rose
enough
they
would
drown
bill
do
we
have
to
he
shrugged
it
said
everything
yeah
they
had
to
what
else
was
there
be
killed
by
henry
victor
and
belch
in
the
barrens
or
by
something
else
maybe
something
worse
in
town
she
understood
his
thought
well
enough
now
there
was
no
stutter
in
his
shrug
better
for
them
to
go
to
it
have
it
out
like
the
showdown
in
a
western
movie
cleaner
braver
richie
said

was
that
ritual

big
bill

smiling
a
little
chiid
richie
nodded

its
tongue

jokes
bill
nodded
funny
richie
said
looking
into
the
dark
pipe
i
can't
think
of
a
single
one
me
either
ben
said
the
fear
was
heavy
in
his
chest
almost
suffocating
he
felt
that
the
only
thing
keeping
him
from
just
sitting
down
in
the
water
and
blubbering
like
a
baby
or
just
going
crazy
was
bill
calm
sure
presence
and
beverly
he
felt
he
would
rather
die
than
show
beverly
how
afraid
he
was
do
you
know
where
this
pipe

bill

his
head

shook
his
head
again

we're
getting
close
richie
said
suddenly
he
drew
a
deep
trembling
breath
if
we
have
to
do
it
then
let
go
bill
nodded

henry

down
at
them

richie
muttered
i
guess
they
formed
up
like
a
procession
of
blindmen
bill
looked
back
once
confirming
that
each
had
a
hand
on
the
shoulder
of
the
person
ahead
then
bending
forward
slightly
against
the
rush
of
the
current
bill
denbrough
led
his
friends
into
the
dark
where
the
boat
he
had
made
for
his
brother
had
gone
almost
a
year
before
chapter
the
circle
closes
tom
tom
rogan
was
having
one
fuck
of
a
crazy
dream
in
it
he
was
killing
his
father
part
of
his
mind
understood
how
crazy
this
was
his
father
had
ded
when
tom
was
only
in
the
third
grade
well
maybe
died
wasn't
such
a
good
word
maybe
committed
suicide
was
actually
the
truth
ralph
rogan
had
made
himself
a
ginandlye
cocktail
one
for
the
road
you
might
say
tom
had
been
put
in
nominal
charge
of
his
brother
and
sisters
and
then
he
began
to
receive
whuppin
if
anything
went
wrong
with
them
so
he
couldn't
have
killed
his
father
except
there
he
was
in
this
frightening
dream
holding
what
looked
like
a
harmless
handle
of
some
ort
to
his
father
neck
only
it
wasn't
really
harmless
was
it
there
was
a
button
in
the
end
of
the
handle
and
if
he
pushed
it
a
blade
would
pop
out
and
go
right
through
his
father
neck
i'm
not
going
to
do
anything
like
that
daddy
don't
worry
his
dreaming
mind
thought
just
before
his
finger
jammed
down
on
the
button
and
the
blade
popped
out
his
father
sleeping
eyes
opened
and
stared
up
at
the
ceiling
his
father
mouth
opened
and
a
bloody
gargling
sound
came
out
daddy
i
didn't
do
it
his
mind
screamed
someone
else
he
struggled
to
wake
up
and
couldn't
the
best
he
could
do
and
it
turned
out
to
be
not
very
good
at
all
was
to
fade
into
a
new
dream
in
this
one
he
was
splashing
and
slogging
his
way
down
a
long
dark
tunnel
his
balls
hurt
and
his
face
stung
because
it
was
crisscrossed
with
scratches
there
were
others
with
him
but
he
could
only
make
out
vague
shapes
it
didn't
matter
anyway
what
mattered
were
the
kids
somewhere
up
ahead
they
needed
to
pay
they
needed
a
whuppin
to
be
punished
whatever
purgatory
this
was
it
was
a
smelly
one
water
dripped
and
echoed
his
shoes
and
pants
were
soaked
the
little
shitpots
were
somewhere
up
ahead
in
this
maze
of
tunnels
and
perhaps
they
thought
henry
tom
and
his
friends
would
get
lost
but
the
joke
was
on
them
haha
all
over
you
because
he
had
another
friend
oh
yes
a
special
friend
and
this
friend
had
marked
the
path
they
were
to
take
with
with
moonballoons
thingamajigs
that
were
big
and
round
and
somehow
lighted
from
within
so
that
they
shed
a
glow
like
that
which
falls
mysteriously
from
oldfashioned
streetlamps
one
of
these
balloons
floated
and
drifted
at
each
intersection
and
on
the
side
of
each
was
an
arrow
pointing
the
way
into
the
tunnelbranch
he
and
belch
and
victor
his
unseen
friends
were
to
take
and
it
was
the
right
path
oh
yes
he
could
hear
the
others
ahead
their
splashing
progress
echoing
back
the
distorted
murmurs
of
their
voices
they
were
getting
closer
catching
up
and
when
they
did
tom
looked
down
and
saw
that
he
still
had
the
switchknife
in
his
hand
for
a
moment
he
was
frightened
this
was
like
one
of
those
crazy
astral
experiences
he
sometimes
read
about
in
the
weekly
tabloids
when
your
spirit
left
your
body
and
entered
someone
else
the
shape
of
his
body
felt
different
to
him
as
if
he
were
not
tom
but
henry
someone
else
someone
younger
he
began
to
fight
his
way
out
of
the
dream
panicked
and
then
a
voice
was
alking
to
him
a
soothing
voice
whispering
in
his
ear
it
doesn't
matter
when
this
is
and
it
doesn't
matter
who
you
are
what
matters
is
that
beverly
is
up
there
she
with
them
my
good
friend
and
do
you
know
what
she
been
doing
something
one
hell
of
a
lot
worse
than
sneaking
smokes
you
know
what
she
been
fucking
her
old
friend
bill
denbrough
yes
indeed
she
and
that
stuttering
freak
going
right
at
it
they
that
a
lie
he
tried
to
scream
she
wouldn't
dare
but
he
knew
it
was
no
lie
she
had
used
a
belt
on
his
kicked
me
in
the
balls
and
run
off
and
she
now
had
cheated
on
him
the
slutty
child
little
roundheels
bitch
had
actually
cheated
on
him
and
oh
dear
friends
oh
good
neighbors
she
was
going
to
get
the
whuppin
of
all
whuppins
first
her
and
then
denbrough
her
novel
writing
friend
and
anyone
who
tried
to
get
in
his
way
you
could
count
them
in
for
a
piece
of
the
action
too
he
stepped
up
his
pace
although
the
breath
was
already
whistling
in
and
out
of
his
throat
up
ahead
he
could
see
another
luminous
circle
bobbing
in
the
darkness
another
moon
balloon
he
could
hear
the
voices
of
the
people
ahead
of
him
and
the
fact
that
they
were
childish
voices
no
longer
bothered
him
it
was
as
the
voice
said
it
didn't
matter
where
when
or
who
beverly
was
up
there
and
oh
dear
friends
oh
good
neighbors
come
on
you
guys
move
your
asses
he
said
and
it
didn't
even
matter
that
his
voice
wasn't
his
own
but
the
voice
of
a
boy
then
as
they
approached
the
moonballoon
he
looked
around
and
saw
his
companions
for
the
first
time
both
of
them
were
dead
one
was
headless
the
face
of
the
other
had
been
split
open
as
if
by
a
great
talon
we're
moving
as
fast
as
we
can
henry
the
boy
with
the
split
face
said
and
his
lips
moved
in
two
pieces
grotesquely
out
of
sync
with
each
other
and
that
was
when
tom
shrieked
the
dream
to
pieces
and
came
back
to
himself
tottering
on
the
brink
of
what
felt
like
some
great
empty
space
he
struggled
to
keep
his
balance
lost
it
and
tumbled
to
the
floor
the
floor
was
carpeted
but
the
fall
still
sent
a
sickening
burst
of
pain
through
his
hurt
knee
and
he
stifled
another
cry
against
his
forearm
where
am
i
where
the
fuck
am
i
he
became
aware
of
a
faint
but
clear
white
light
and
for
a
frightening
moment
he
thought
he
was
back
in
the
dream
again
that
it
was
light
cast
by
one
of
those
crazy
balloons
then
he
remembered
leaving
the
bathroom
door
partially
open
and
the
fluorescent
light
in
there
on
he
always
left
the
light
on
when
staying
in
a
strange
place
it
saved
you
barking
your
shins
if
you
had
to
get
up
in
the
night
to
pee
that
clicked
reality
into
place
it
had
been
a
dream
all
some
crazy
dream
he
was
in
a
holiday
inn
this
was
derry
maine
he
had
chased
his
wife
here
and
in
the
middle
of
a
crazy
nightmare
he
had
fallen
out
of
bed
that
was
all
that
was
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
that
wasn't
just
a
nightmare
he
jumped
as
if
the
words
had
been
spoken
beside
his
ear
instead
of
inside
his
own
mind
it
didn't
seem
like
his
own
interior
voice
at
all
it
was
cold
alien
but
somehow
hypnotic
and
believable
he
got
up
slowly
fumbled
a
glass
of
water
off
the
table
beside
the
bed
and
drank
it
down
he
ran
shaky
hands
through
his
hair
the
clock
on
the
table
said
ten
past
three
go
back
to
sleep
wait
until
morning
that
alien
voice
answered
but
there
will
be
people
around
in
the
morning
too
many
people
and
besides
you
can
beat
them
down
there
this
time
this
time
you
can
be
first
down
there
he
thought
of
his
dream
the
water
the
dripping
dark
the
light
suddenly
seemed
brighter
he
turned
his
head
not
wanting
to
but
helpless
to
stop
a
groan
slipped
out
of
his
mouth
a
balloon
was
tied
to
the
knob
of
the
bathroom
door
it
floated
at
the
end
of
a
string
about
three
feet
long
the
balloon
glowed
full
of
a
ghostly
white
light
it
looked
like
a
wilothewisp
glimpsed
in
a
swamp
floating
dreamily
between
trees
overhung
with
gray
ropes
of
moss
an
arrow
was
printed
on
the
balloon
gently
bulging
skin
an
arrow
that
was
blood
scarlet
it
was
pointing
at
the
door
leading
out
into
the
hall
it
doesn't
really
matter
who
i
am
the
voice
said
soothingly
and
tom
realized
now
that
it
wasn't
coming
from
either
his
own
head
or
from
beside
his
ear
it
was
coming
from
the
balloon
from
the
center
of
that
strange
lovely
white
light
all
that
matters
is
that
i
am
going
to
see
that
everything
turns
out
to
your
satisfaction
tom
i
want
to
see
her
take
a
whuppin
i
want
to
see
them
all
take
a
whuppin
they've
crossed
my
path
once
too
often
and
much
too
late
in
the
day
for
them
so
listen
tom
listen
very
carefully
all
together
now
follow
the
bouncing
ball
tom
listened
the
voice
from
the
balloon
explained
it
explained
everything
when
it
was
done
it
popped
in
one
final
flash
of
light
and
tom
began
to
dress
audra
audra
also
had
nightmares
she
awoke
with
a
start
sitting
boltupright
in
bed
the
sheet
pulled
around
her
waist
her
small
breasts
moving
with
her
quick
agitated
breathing
like
tom
her
dreaming
had
been
a
jumbled
distressful
experience
like
tom
she
had
had
the
sensation
of
being
someone
else
or
rather
of
having
her
own
consciousness
deposited
and
partially
submerged
in
another
body
and
another
mind
she
had
been
in
a
dark
place
with
a
number
of
others
around
her
and
she
had
been
aware
of
an
oppressive
sensation
of
danger
they
were
going
into
the
danger
deliberately
and
she
wanted
to
scream
at
them
to
stop
to
explain
to
her
what
was
happening
but
the
person
with
whom
she
had
merged
seemed
to
know
and
to
believe
it
was
necessary
she
was
also
aware
that
they
were
being
chased
and
that
their
pursuers
were
catching
up
little
by
little
bill
had
been
in
the
dream
but
his
story
about
how
he
had
forgotten
his
childhood
must
have
been
on
her
mind
because
in
her
dream
bill
was
only
a
boy
ten
or
twelve
years
old
he
still
had
all
his
hair
she
was
holding
his
hand
and
was
dimly
aware
that
she
loved
him
very
much
and
that
her
willingness
to
go
on
was
based
on
the
rocksolid
belief
that
bill
would
protect
her
and
all
of
them
that
bill
big
bill
would
somehow
bring
them
through
this
and
back
into
the
daylight
again
oh
but
she
was
so
terrified
they
came
to
a
branching
of
many
tunnels
and
bill
stood
there
looking
from
one
to
the
next
and
one
of
the
others
a
boy
with
his
arm
in
a
cast
which
glimmered
a
ghostly
white
in
the
darkness
spoke
up
that
one
bill
the
bottom
one
yyyou're
ss
sure
yes
and
so
they
had
gone
that
way
and
then
there
had
been
a
door
a
wee
wooden
door
no
more
than
three
feet
high
the
sort
of
door
you
might
see
in
afairytale
book
and
there
had
been
a
mark
on
the
door
she
could
not
remember
what
that
mark
had
been
what
strange
rune
or
symbol
but
it
had
brought
all
her
terror
to
a
focusingpoint
and
she
had
yanked
herself
out
of
that
other
body
that
girl
body
whoever
beverly
beverly
she
might
have
been
she
avoke
boltupright
in
a
strange
bed
sweaty
wideeyed
gasping
as
if
she
had
just
run
a
race
her
hands
flew
to
her
legs
halfexpecting
to
find
them
wet
and
cold
with
the
water
she
had
been
walking
through
in
her
head
but
she
was
dry
disorientation
followed
this
was
not
their
home
in
topanga
canyon
or
the
rented
house
in
fleet
it
was
noplace
limbo
furnished
with
a
bed
a
dresser
two
chairs
and
a
tv
oh
god
come
on
audra
she
scrubbed
her
hands
viciously
across
her
face
and
that
sickening
feeling
of
mental
vertigo
receded
she
was
in
derry
derry
maine
where
her
husband
had
grown
through
a
childhood
he
claimed
no
longer
to
remember
not
a
familiar
place
to
her
or
a
particularly
good
place
by
its
feel
but
at
least
a
known
place
she
was
here
because
bill
was
here
and
she
would
see
him
tomorrow
at
the
derry
town
house
whatever
terrible
thing
was
wrong
here
whatever
those
new
scars
on
his
hands
meant
they
would
face
it
together
she
would
call
him
tell
him
she
was
here
then
join
him
after
that
well
actually
she
had
no
idea
what
came
after
that
the
vertigo
that
sense
of
being
in
a
place
that
was
really
noplace
was
threatening
again
when
she
was
nineteen
she
had
done
a
whistlestop
tour
with
a
scraggy
little
production
company
forty
notsowonderful
performances
of
arsenic
and
old
lace
in
forty
notsowonderful
towns
and
small
cities
all
of
this
in
fortyseven
notsowonderful
days
they
began
at
the
peabody
dinner
theater
in
massachusetts
and
ended
at
hay
it
again
sam
in
sausalito
and
somewhere
in
between
in
some
midwestern
town
like
ames
iowa
or
grand
isle
nebraska
or
maybe
jubilee
north
dakota
she
had
awakened
like
this
in
the
middle
of
the
night
panicked
by
disorientation
unsure
what
town
she
was
in
what
day
it
was
or
why
she
was
wherever
she
was
even
her
name
seemed
unreal
to
her
that
feeling
was
back
now
her
bad
dreams
had
carried
over
into
her
waking
and
she
felt
a
nightmarish
freefloating
terror
the
town
seemed
to
have
wrapped
itself
around
her
like
a
python
she
could
sense
it
and
the
feelings
it
produced
were
not
good
she
found
herself
wishing
that
she
had
heeded
freddie
advice
and
stayed
away
her
mind
fixed
on
bill
grasping
at
the
thought
of
him
the
way
a
drowning
woman
would
grip
at
a
spar
a
lifepreserver
anything
that
we
all
float
down
here
audra
floats
a
chill
raced
through
her
and
she
crisscrossed
her
arms
across
her
naked
breasts
she
shivered
and
saw
goosebumps
ripple
their
way
up
her
flesh
for
a
moment
it
seemed
to
her
that
a
voice
had
spoken
aloud
but
inside
her
head
as
if
there
was
an
alien
presence
in
there
am
i
going
crazy
god
is
that
it
no
her
mind
responded
it
just
disorientation
jetlag
worry
over
your
man
nobody
talking
inside
your
head
nobody
we
all
float
down
here
audr
a
voice
said
from
the
bathroom
it
was
a
real
voice
real
as
houses
and
sly
sly
and
duty
and
evil
you'll
float
too
the
voice
uttered
a
fruity
little
giggle
that
dropped
in
pitch
until
it
sounded
like
a
clogged
drain
bubbling
thickly
audra
cried
out
then
pressed
her
hands
against
her
mouth
i
didn't
hear
that
she
said
it
out
loud
daring
the
voice
to
contradict
her
it
didn't
the
room
was
silent
somewhere
far
away
a
train
whistled
in
the
night
suddenly
she
needed
bill
so
badly
that
waiting
until
daylight
seemed
impossible
she
was
in
a
standardized
motel
room
exactly
like
the
other
thirtynine
units
in
the
place
but
suddenly
it
was
too
much
everything
when
you
started
hearing
voices
it
was
just
too
much
too
creepy
she
seemed
to
be
slipping
back
into
the
nightmare
she'd
so
lately
escaped
she
felt
scared
and
terribly
alone
it
worse
than
that
she
thought
i
feel
dead
her
heart
suddenly
skipped
two
beats
in
her
chest
making
her
gasp
and
utter
a
startled
cough
she
felt
an
instant
of
prisompanic
claustrophobia
inside
her
own
body
and
wondered
if
all
this
terror
didn't
have
a
stupidly
ordinary
physical
root
after
all
maybe
she
was
going
have
a
heart
attack
or
was
already
having
one
her
heart
settled
but
uneasily
audra
turned
on
the
light
by
the
bedtable
and
looked
at
her
watch
twelve
past
three
he
would
be
sleeping
but
that
didn't
matter
to
her
now
nothing
mattered
except
hearing
his
voice
she
wanted
to
finish
the
night
with
him
if
bill
was
beside
her
her
clockwork
would
fall
in
sync
with
his
and
settle
down
the
nightmares
would
stay
away
he
sold
nightmares
to
others
that
was
his
trade
but
to
her
he
had
never
gven
anything
but
peace
outside
that
odd
cold
nut
imbedded
in
his
imagination
peace
seemed
to
be
all
he
was
made
for
or
meant
for
she
got
the
yellow
pages
found
the
number
for
the
derry
town
house
and
dialed
it
derry
town
house
would
you
please
ring
mr
denbrough
room
mr
william
denbrough
does
that
guy
ever
get
any
calls
in
the
daytime
the
clerk
said
and
before
she
could
think
to
ask
what
that
was
supposed
to
mean
he
had
plugged
her
call
through
the
phone
burred
once
twice
three
times
she
could
imagine
him
sleeping
with
everything
under
the
covers
except
the
top
of
his
head
she
could
imagine
one
hand
coming
out
feeling
for
the
phone
she
had
seen
him
do
it
before
and
a
fond
little
smile
touched
her
lips
it
faded
as
the
phone
rang
a
fourth
time
and
a
fifth
and
a
sixth
halfway
through
the
seventh
ring
the
connection
was
broken
that
room
does
not
answer
no
shit
sherlock
audra
said
more
upset
and
frightened
than
ever
are
you
sure
you
rang
the
right
room
ayu
the
clerk
said
mr
denbrough
had
an
interroom
call
not
five
minutes
ago
i
know
he
answered
that
one
because
the
light
stayed
on
the
switchboard
a
minute
or
two
he
must
have
gone
to
the
person
room
well
which
room
was
i
don't
remember
sixth
floor
i
think
but
she
dropped
the
phone
back
into
its
cradle
a
queer
disheartening
certainty
came
to
her
it
was
a
woman
some
woman
had
called
him
and
he
had
gone
to
her
well
what
now
audra
how
do
we
handle
this
she
felt
tears
threaten
they
stung
her
eyes
and
her
nose
she
could
feel
the
lump
of
a
sob
in
the
back
of
her
throat
no
anger
at
least
not
yet
only
a
sick
sense
of
loss
and
abandonment
audra
get
hold
of
yourself
you're
jumping
to
conclusions
it
the
middle
of
the
night
and
you
had
a
bad
dream
and
now
you've
got
bill
with
some
other
woman
but
it
ain't
necessarily
so
what
you're
going
to
do
is
sit
up
you'll
never
get
back
to
sleep
now
anyway
turn
on
some
lights
and
finish
the
novel
you
brought
to
read
on
the
plane
remember
what
bill
says
finest
kind
of
dope
bookvalium
no
more
heebiejeebies
no
more
whimwhams
and
hearing
voices
dorothy
sayers
and
lord
peter
that
the
ticket
the
nine
tailors
that'll
take
you
through
to
dawn
that'll
the
bathroom
light
suddenly
went
on
she
could
see
it
under
the
door
then
the
latch
clicked
and
the
door
juddered
open
she
stared
at
this
eyes
widening
arms
instinctively
crossing
over
her
breasts
again
her
heart
began
to
slam
against
her
ribcage
and
the
sour
taste
of
adrenaline
flooded
her
mouth
that
voice
low
and
dragging
said
we
all
float
down
here
audra
the
last
word
became
a
long
low
fading
scream
audraaaaa
that
ended
once
again
in
that
sick
clogged
bubbly
sound
that
was
so
much
like
laughter
who
there
she
cried
backing
away
that
wasn't
my
imagination
no
way
you're
not
going
to
tell
me
thatthe
tv
clicked
on
she
whirled
around
and
saw
a
clown
in
a
silvery
suit
with
big
orange
buttons
capering
around
on
the
screen
there
were
black
sockets
where
its
eyes
should
have
been
and
when
its
madeup
lips
stretched
even
wider
in
a
grin
she
saw
teeth
like
razors
it
held
up
a
dripping
severed
head
its
eyes
were
turned
up
to
the
whites
and
the
mouth
sagged
open
but
she
could
see
well
enough
that
it
was
freddie
firestone
head
the
clown
laughed
and
danced
it
swung
the
head
around
and
drops
of
blood
splashed
against
the
inside
of
the
tv
screen
she
could
hear
them
sizzling
in
there
audra
tried
to
scream
and
nothing
came
out
but
a
little
whine
she
grabbed
blindly
for
the
dress
lying
over
the
back
of
the
chair
and
for
her
purse
she
bolted
into
the
hall
and
slammed
the
door
behind
her
gasping
her
face
paperwhite
she
dropped
the
purse
between
her
feet
and
slipped
the
dress
over
her
head
float
a
low
chuckling
voice
said
from
behind
her
and
she
felt
a
cold
finger
caress
her
bare
heel
she
uttered
another
high
outof
breath
scream
and
danced
away
from
the
door
white
corpsefingers
were
seeking
back
and
forth
under
it
the
nails
peeled
away
to
show
purplish
white
bloodless
quicks
they
made
hoarse
whispering
noises
on
the
rough
nap
of
the
hall
carpet
audra
snagged
the
strap
of
her
purse
and
ran
barefooted
for
the
door
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
she
was
in
a
blind
panic
now
her
only
thought
that
she
had
to
find
the
derry
town
house
and
bill
it
didn't
matter
if
he
was
in
bed
with
enough
other
women
to
make
up
a
harem
she
would
find
him
and
get
him
to
take
her
away
from
whatever
unspeakable
thing
there
was
in
this
town
she
fled
down
the
walkway
and
into
the
parkinglot
looking
around
wildly
for
her
car
for
a
moment
her
mind
froze
and
she
couldn't
even
remember
what
she
had
been
driving
then
it
came
datsun
tobaccobrown
she
spotted
it
standing
hubcapdeep
in
the
still
curdled
groundmist
and
hurried
over
to
it
she
couldn't
find
the
keys
in
her
purse
she
swept
through
it
with
steadily
increasing
panic
shuffling
kleenex
cosmetics
change
sunglasses
and
sticks
of
gum
into
a
meaningless
jumble
she
didn't
notice
the
battered
ltd
wagon
parked
nosetonose
with
her
rented
car
or
the
man
sitting
behind
the
wheel
she
didn't
notice
when
the
ltd
door
opened
and
the
man
got
out
she
was
trying
to
cope
with
the
growing
certainty
that
she
had
left
the
datsun
keys
in
the
room
she
couldn't
go
back
in
there
she
couldn't
her
fingers
touched
hard
serrated
metal
under
a
box
of
altoid
mints
and
she
seized
at
it
with
a
little
cry
of
triumph
for
a
terrible
moment
she
thought
it
might
be
the
key
to
their
rover
now
sitting
in
the
fleet
railway
station
carpark
three
thousand
miles
away
and
then
she
felt
the
lucite
rentakcar
tab
she
fumbled
the
key
into
the
doorlock
breathing
in
harsh
little
gasps
and
turned
it
that
was
when
a
hand
fell
on
her
shoulder
and
she
screamed
screamed
loudly
this
time
somewhere
a
dog
barked
in
answer
but
that
was
all
the
hand
as
hard
as
steel
bit
cruelly
in
and
forced
her
around
the
face
she
saw
looming
over
hers
was
puffed
and
lumpy
the
eyes
glittered
when
the
swelled
lips
spread
in
a
grotesque
smile
she
saw
that
some
of
the
man
front
teeth
had
been
broken
the
stumps
looked
jagged
and
savage
she
tried
to
speak
and
could
not
the
hand
squeezed
tighter
digging
in
haven't
i
seen
you
in
the
movies
tom
rogan
whispered
eddie
room
beverly
and
bill
dressed
quickly
without
speaking
and
went
up
to
eddie
room
on
their
way
to
the
elevator
they
heard
a
phonebell
begin
somewhere
behind
them
f
was
muffled
a
somewhere
else
sound
bill
was
that
yours
ccould
have
bbbeen
he
said
one
of
the
uhothers
ccalling
muhhaybe
he
punched
the
up
button
eddie
opened
the
door
for
them
his
face
white
and
strained
his
left
arm
was
at
an
angle
both
peculiar
and
weirdly
evocative
of
old
times
tm
okay
he
said
i
took
two
darvon
pain
not
bad
right
now
but
it
was
clearly
not
good
either
his
lips
pressed
so
tightly
together
they
had
almost
disappeared
were
purple
with
shock
bill
looked
past
him
and
saw
the
body
on
the
floor
one
look
was
enough
to
satisfy
him
of
two
things
it
was
henry
bowers
and
he
was
dead
he
moved
past
eddie
and
knelt
by
the
body
the
neck
of
a
perrier
bottle
had
been
driven
into
henry
midsection
pulling
the
tatters
of
his
shirt
in
after
it
henry
eyes
were
halfopen
glazed
his
mouth
filled
with
coagulating
blood
snarled
his
hands
were
claws
a
shadow
fell
over
him
and
bill
looked
up
it
was
beverly
she
looked
down
at
henry
with
no
expression
at
all
all
the
times
he
chchchased
us
bill
said
she
nodded
he
doesn't
look
old
you
know
that
bill
he
doesn't
look
old
at
all
abruptly
she
looked
back
at
eddie
who
was
sitting
on
the
bed
eddie
looked
old
old
and
haggard
his
arm
lay
in
his
lap
useless
we've
got
to
call
the
doctor
for
eddie
n
bill
and
eddie
said
in
unison
but
he
hurt
his
arm
tt
the
same
as
luhluhlast
tttim
bill
said
he
got
to
his
feet
and
held
her
by
the
arms
looking
into
her
face
once
we
œ
go
outside
once
w
w
we
ihinv
vholve
the
tttown
they'll
arrest
me
for
murder
eddie
said
dully
or
they'll
arrest
all
of
us
or
they'll
detain
us
or
something
then
there'll
be
an
accident
one
of
the
pecial
accidents
that
only
happen
in
derry
maybe
they'll
stick
us
in
jail
and
a
deputy
sheriff
will
go
berserk
and
shoot
us
all
maybe
we'll
all
die
of
ptomaine
or
decide
to
hang
ourselves
in
our
cells
eddie
that
crazy
that
is
it
he
asked
remember
this
is
derry
but
we're
grownups
now
surely
you
don't
think
i
mean
he
came
here
in
the
middle
of
the
night
attacked
you
w
with
what
bill
said
where
the
nuhnuh
knife
she
looked
around
didn't
see
it
and
dropped
on
her
knees
to
look
under
the
bed
don't
bother
eddie
said
in
that
same
faint
whistly
voice
i
slammed
the
door
on
his
arm
when
he
tried
to
stick
me
with
it
he
dropped
it
and
i
kicked
it
under
the
tv
it
gone
now
i
already
looked
bbbeheverly
ccall
the
others
bill
said
can
spuh
splint
eeeddie
arm
i
thhink
she
looked
at
him
for
a
long
moment
then
she
looked
down
at
the
body
on
the
floor
again
she
thought
that
the
picture
this
room
presented
should
tell
a
perfectly
clear
story
to
any
policeman
with
half
a
brain
the
place
was
a
mess
eddie
arm
was
broken
this
man
was
dead
it
was
a
clear
case
of
selfdefense
against
a
nightprowler
and
then
she
remembered
mr
ross
mr
ross
getting
up
and
looking
and
then
simply
folding
his
newspaper
and
going
back
into
the
house
once
we
go
outside
once
we
involve
the
town
that
made
her
remember
bill
as
a
kid
his
face
white
and
tired
and
halfcrazy
bill
saying
derry
is
it
do
you
understand
me
any
place
we
go
when
it
gets
us
they
won't
see
they
won't
hear
they
won't
know
don't
you
see
how
it
is
all
we
can
do
is
to
try
and
finish
what
we
started
standing
here
now
looking
down
at
henry
corpse
beverly
thought
they're
both
saying
we've
all
become
ghosts
again
that
it
started
to
repeat
all
of
it
as
a
kid
i
could
accept
that
because
kids
almost
are
ghosts
but
are
you
sure
she
asked
desperately
bill
are
you
sure
'
he
was
sitting
on
the
bed
with
eddie
gently
touching
his
arm
aaaren't
yyo
he
asked
after
aaall
that
hub
happened
ttoda
yes
all
that
had
happened
the
gruesome
mess
at
the
end
of
their
reunion
the
beautiful
old
woman
who
had
turned
into
a
crone
before
her
eyes
my
fodder
was
also
my
mudder
the
round
of
stories
at
the
library
tonight
with
the
accompanying
phenomena
all
of
those
things
and
still
her
mind
shouted
at
her
desperately
to
stop
this
now
to
spike
it
with
sanity
because
if
she
did
not
hey
were
surely
going
to
finish
up
this
night
by
going
down
to
the
barrens
and
finding
a
certain
pumping
station
and
don't
kno
she
said
i
just
i
don't
know
even
after
everything
that
happened
bill
it
seems
to
me
that
we
could
call
the
police
maybe
cc
call
the
uh
others
he
said
again
we'll
ss
see
what
they
ththink
all
right
she
called
richie
first
then
ben
both
agreed
to
come
right
away
neither
asked
what
had
happened
she
found
mike
telephone
number
in
the
book
and
dialed
it
there
was
no
answer
after
a
dozen
rings
she
hung
up
tttry
the
luhluhhibrar
bill
said
he
had
taken
the
short
curtain
rods
down
from
the
smaller
of
the
two
windows
in
eddie
room
and
was
binding
them
firmly
to
eddie
arm
with
the
belt
of
his
bathrobe
and
the
drawstring
from
his
pyjamas
before
she
could
find
the
number
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
ben
and
richie
had
arrived
together
ben
in
jeans
and
an
untucked
shirt
richie
in
a

of

his
glasses

ben
took
three
steps
toward
the
corpse
and
then
stopped
as
if
afraid

might
bite
him
he
looked
helplessly
at
bill
yyyou

said

while
beverly
hunted
up
the
number
for
the
derry
public
library
and
called
it
she
expected
that
perhaps
mike
had
fallen
asleep
there
he
might
even
have
a
bunk
in
his
office
what
she
did
not
expect
was
what
happened
the
phone
was
picked
up
on
the
second
ring
and
a
voice
she
had
never
heard
before
said
hello
hello
she
answered
looking
toward
the
others
and
making
a
shushing
gesture
with
one
hand
is
mr
hanlon
there
who
this
the
voice
asked
she
wet
her
lips
with
her
tongue
bill
was
looking
at
her
piercingly
ben
and
richie
had
looked
around
the
beginnings
of
real
alarm
stirred
inside
her
who
are
you
she
countered
you're
not
mr
hanlon
i'm
derry
chief
of
police
andrew
rademacher
the
voice
said
mr
hanlon
is
at
the
derry
home
hospital
right
now
he
was
assaulted
and
badly
wounded
a
short
time
ago
now
who
are
you
please
i
want
your
name
but
she
barely
heard
this
last
waves
of
shock
rode
through
her
lifting
her
dizzily
up
and
up
outside
of
herself
the
muscles
in
her
stomach
and
legs
and
crotch
all
went
loose
and
numb
and
she
thought
in
a
detached
way
this
must
be
how
it
happens
when
people
get
so
scared
they
wet
their
pants
sure
you
just
lose
control
of
those
muscles
how
badly
has
he
been
hurt
she
heard
herself
asking
in
a
papery
voice
and
then
bill
was
beside
her
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
and
ben
was
there
and
richie
and
she
felt
such
a
rush
of
gratitude
for
them
she
held
her
free
hand
out
and
bill
took
it
richie
placed
his
hand
over
bill
and
ben
put
his
over
richie
eddie
had
come
over
and
now
he
put
his
good
hand
on
top
i
want
your
name
please
rademacher
said
briskly
and
for
a
moment
the
skitering
little
craven
inside
of
her
the
one
that
had
been
bred
by
her
father
and
cared
for
by
her
husband
almost
answered
i’m
beverly
marsh
and
i'm
at
the
derry
town
house
please
send
mr
nell
over
there
a
dead
man
here
who
still
half
a
boy
and
we're
all
very
frightened
she
said
i
i'm
afraid
i
can't
tell
you
not
just
yet
what
do
you
know
about
this
nothing
she
said
shocked
what
makes
you
think
i
do
jesus
christ
you
just
make
a
habit
of
calling
the
library
every
morning
about
threethirty
rademacher
said
is
that
it
can
the
bullshit
young
lady
this
is
assault
and
the
way
the
guy
looks
it
could
be
murder
by
the
time
the
sun
comes
up
i'll
ask
you
again
who
are
you
and
how
much
do
you
know
about
this
closing
her
eyes
gripping
bill
hand
with
all
her
strength
she
asked
again
he
might
die
you're
not
just
saying
that
to
scare
me
he
really
might
die
please
tell
me
he
very
badly
hurt
and
if
that
doesn't
scare
you
miss
it
ought
to
now
i
want
to
know
who
you
are
and
why
as
if
in
a
dream
she
watched
her
hand
float
through
space
and
drop
the
phone
back
into
the
cradle
she
looked
over
at
henry
and
felt
shock
as
keen
as
a
slap
from
a
cold
hand
one
of
henry
eyes
had
closed
the
other
one
the
shattered
one
oozed
as
nakedly
as
before
henry
seemed
to
be
winking
at
her
richie
called
the
hospital
bill
led
beverly
over
to
the
bed
where
she
sat
with
eddie
looking
off
into
space
she
thought
she
would
cry
but
no
tears
came
the
only
feeling
she
was
strongly
and
immediately
aware
of
was
a
wish
that
someone
would
cover
henry
bowers
that
winky
look
was
really
not
cool
at
all
in
one
giddy
instant
richie
became
a
reporter
from
the
derry
news
he
understood
that
mr
michael
hanlon
the
town
head
librarian
had
been
assaulted
while
working
late
did
the
hospital
have
any
word
on
mr
hanlon
condition
richie
listened
nodding
i
understand
mr
kerpaskian
do
you
spell
that
with
two
k
you
do
okay
and
you
are
he
listened
now
enough
into
his
own
fiction
to
make
doodling
motions
with
one
finger
as
if
writing
on
a
pad
uhhuh
uhhuh
yes
yes
i
understand
well
what
we
usually
do
in
cases
like
this
is
to
quote
you
as
a
source
then
later
on
we
can
uhhuh
right
just
right
richie
laughed
heartily
and
armed
a
film
of
sweat
from
his
forehead
he
listened
again
okay
mr
kerpaskian
yes
i'll
yes
i
got
it
kerpasklan
right
czech
jewish
is
it
really
thats
that
most
unusual
yes
i
will
goodnight
thank
you
he
hung
up
and
closed
his
eyes
jesus
he
cried
in
a
thick
low
voice
jesus
jesus
jesus
he
made
as
if
to
shove
the
phone
off
the
table
and
then
simply
let
his
hand
fall
he
took
his
glasses
off
and
wiped
them
on
his
pyjama
top
he
alive
but
in
grave
condition
he
told
the
others
henry
sliced
him
up
like
a
christmas
turkey
one
of
the
cuts
chopped
into
his
femoral
artery
and
he
lost
all
the
blood
a
man
can
and
still
stay
alive
mike
managed
to
get
some
kind
of
tourniquet
on
it
or
he
would
have
been
dead
when
they
found
him
beverly
began
to
cry
she
did
it
like
a
child
with
both
hands
plastered
to
her
face
for
a
little
while
her
hitching
sobs
and
the
rapid
whistle
of
eddie
breathing
were
the
only
sounds
in
the
room
mike
wasn't
the
only
one
who
got
sliced
up
like
a
christmas
turkey
eddie
said
at
last
henry
looked
like
he
just
went
twelve
rounds
with
rocky
balboa
in
a
cuisinart
ddo
you
still
w
w
want
to
¢
g
go
to
the
pppolice
bev
there
were
kleenex
on
the
nighttable
but
they
were
a
caked
and
sodden
mass
in
the
middle
of
a
puddle
of
perrier
she
went
into
the
bathroom
making
a
wide
circle
around
henry
got
a
washcloth
and
ran
cool
water
on
it
it
felt
delicious
against
her
hot
puffy
face
she
felt
that
she
could
think
clearly
again
not
rationally
but
clearly
she
was
suddenly
sure
that
rationality
would
kill
them
if
they
tried
to
use
it
now
that
cop
rademacher
he
had
been
suspicious
why
not
people
didn't
call
the
library
at
threethirty
in
the
morning
he
had
assumed
some
guilty
knowledge
what
would
he
assume
if
he
found
out
that
she
had
called
him
from
a
room
where
there
was
a
dead
man
on
the
floor
with
a
jagged
bottleneck
planted
in
his
guts
that
she
and
four
other
strangers
had
just
come
into
town
the
day
before
for
a
little
reunion
and
this
guy
just
happened
to
drop
by
would
she
buy
the
tale
if
the
shoe
were
on
the
other
foot
would
anyone
of
course
they
could
buttress
their
tale
by
adding
that
they
had
come
back
to
finish
the
monster
that
lived
in
the
drains
under
the
city
that
would
certainly
add
a
convincing
note
of
gritty
realism
she
came
out
of
the
bathroom
and
looked
at
bill
n
she
said
i
don't
want
to
go
to
the
police
i
think
eddie
nght
something
might
happen
to
us
something
final
but
that
isn't
the
real
reason
she
looked
at
the
four
of
them
we
swore
it
she
said
we
swore
bill
brother
stan
all
the
others
and
now
mike
i'm
ready
bill
bill
looked
at
the
others
richie
nodded
okay
big
bill
let
try
ben
said
the
odds
look
worse
than
ever
we're
two
short
now
bill
said
nothing
okay
ben
nodded
she
right
we
swore
eeeddi
eddie
smiled
wanly
i
guess
i
get
another
piggerback
down
that
ladder
huh
if
the
ladder
still
there
no
one
throwing
rocks
this
time
though
beverly
said
they're
dead
all
three
of
them
do
we
do
it
now
bill
richie
asked
yyye
bill
said
ththink
this
is
the
tttime
can
i
say
something
ben
asked
abruptly
bill
looked
at
him
and
grinned
a
little
aa
any
time
you
guys
are
still
the
best
friends
i
ever
had
ben
said
no
matter
how
this
turns
out
i
just
you
know
wanted
to
tell
you
that
he
looked
around
at
them
and
they
looked
solemnly
back
at
him
tm
glad
i
remembered
you
he
added
richie
snorted
beverly
giggled
then
they
were
all
laughing
looking
at
each
other
in
the
old
way
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
mike
was
in
the
hospital
perhaps
dying
or
already
dead
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
eddie
arm
was
broken
again
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it
was
the
deepest
ditch
of
the
morning
haystack
you
have
such
a
way
with
words
richie
said
laughing
and
wiping
his
eyes
he
should
have
been
the
writer
big
bill
still
smiling
a
little
bill
said
and
on
that
nub
nuh
note
they
took
eddie
borrowed
limo
richie
drove
the
groundfog
was
thicker
now
drifting
through
the
streets
like
cigarette
smoke
not
quite
reaching
the
hooded
streetlamps
the
stars
overhead
were
bright
chips
of
ice
spring
stars
but
by
cocking
his
head
to
the
halfopen
window
on
the
passenger
side
bill
thought
he
could
hear
summer
thunder
in
the
distance
ram
was
being
ordered
up
somewhere
over
the
horizon
richie
turned
on
the
radio
and
there
was
gene
vincent
singing
bebopalula
he
hit
one
of
the
other
buttons
and
got
buddy
holly
a
third
punch
brought
eddie
cochran
singing
summertime
blues
td
like
to
help
you
son
but
you're
too
young
to
vot
a
deep
voice
said
turn
it
off
richie
beverly
said
softly
he
reached
for
it
and
then
his
hand
froze
stay
tuned
for
more
of
the
richie
tozier
all
dead
rock
show
the
clown
laughing
screaming
voice
cried
over
the
fingerpops
and
guitarchops
of
the
eddie
cochran
tune
don't
touch
that
dial
keep
it
tuned
to
the
rockpile
they're
gone
from
the
charts
but
not
from
our
hearts
and
you
keep
coming
come
right
along
come
on
everybody
we
play
aaaalll
the
hits
down
here
aaallllll
the
hits
and
if
you
don't
believe
me
just
listen
to
this
morning
graveyardshift
guest
deejay
georgie
denbrough
tell
em
georgie
and
suddenly
bill
brother
was
wailing
out
of
the
radio
you
sent
me
out
and
it
killed
me
i
thought
it
was
in
the
cellar
big
bill
i
thought
it
was
in
the
cellar
but
it
was
in
the
drain
it
was
in
the
drain
and
it
killed
me
you
let
it
kill
me
big
bill
you
let
itrichie
snapped
the
radio
off
so
hard
the
knob
spun
away
and
hit
the
floormat
rock
and
roll
in
the
sticks
really
sucks
he
said
his
voice
was
not
quite
steady
bev
right
we'll
leave
it
off
what
do
you
say
no
one
replied
bill
face
was
pale
and
still
and
thoughtful
under
the
glow
of
the
passing
streetlamps
and
when
the
thunder
muttered
again
in
the
west
they
all
heard
it
in
the
barrens
same
old
bridge
richie
parked
beside
it
and
they
got
out
and
moved
to
the
railing
same
old
railing
and
looked
down
same
old
barrens
it
seemed
untouched
by
the
last
twentyseven
years
to
bill
the
turnpike
overpass
which
was
the
only
new
feature
looked
unreal
something
as
epheneral
as
a
matte
painting
or
a
rearscreen
projection
effect
in
a
movie
cruddy
little
trees
and
scrub
bushes
glimmered
in
the
twining
fog
and
bill
thought
j
guess
this
is
what
we
mean
when
we
talk
about
the
persistence
of
memory
this
or
something
like
this
something
you
see
at
the
right
time
and
from
the
right
angle
image
that
kicks
off
emotion
like
a
jet
engine
you
see
it
so
clear
that
all
the
things
which
happened
in
between
are
gone
if
desire
is
what
closes
the
circle
between
world
and
want
then
the
circle
has
closed
cuhcuhcome
on
he
said
and
climbed
over
the
railing
they
followed
him
down
the
embankment
in
a
scatter
of
scree
and
pebbles
when
they
reached
the
bottom
bill
checked
automatically
for
silver
and
then
laughed
at
himself
silver
was
leaning
against
the
wall
of
mike
garage
it
seemed
silver
had
no
pan
b
play
in
this
at
all
although
that
was
strange
after
the
way
it
had
turned
up
tub
take
us
there
bill
told
ben
ben
looked
at
him
and
bill
read
the
thought
in
his
eyes
it
been
twentyseven
years
bill
dream
on
and
then
he
nodded
and
headed
into
the
undergrowth
the
path
their
path
had
long
since
grown
over
and
they
had
to
force
themselves
through
tangles
of
thornbushes
prickers
and
wild
hydrangea
so
fragrant
it
was
cloying
crickets
sang
somnolently
all
around
them
and
a
few
lightningbugs
early
arrivals
at
summer
luscious
party
poked
at
the
dark
bill
supposed
kids
still
played
down
here
but
they
had
made
their
own
runs
and
secret
ways
they
came
to
the
clearing
where
the
clubhouse
had
been
but
now
there
was
no
clearing
here
at
all
bushes
and
lackluster
scrub
pines
had
reclaimed
it
all
look
ben
whispered
and
crossed
the
clearing
in
their
memories
it
was
still
here
simply
overlaid
with
another
of
those
matte
paintings
he
yanked
at
something
it
was
the
mahogany
door
they
had
found
on
the
edge
of
the
dump
the
one
they
had
used
to
finish
off
the
clubhouse
roof
it
had
been
cast
aside
here
and
looked
as
if
it
hadn't
been
touched
in
a
dozen
years
or
more
creepers
were
firmly
entrenched
across
its
dirty
surface
leave
it
alone
haystack
richie
murmured
it
old
tuh
tuh
take
us
ththere
b
ben
bill
repeated
from
behind
them
so
they
went
down
to
the
kenduskeag
following
him
bearing
left
away
from
the
clearing
that
didn’t
exist
anymore
the
sound
of
running
water
grew
steadily
louder
but
they
still
almost
fell
into
the
kenduskeag
before
any
of
them
saw
it
the
foliage
had
grown
up
in
a
tangled
wall
on
the
edge
of
the
embankment
the
edge
broke
off
under
the
heels
of
ben
cowboy
boots
and
bill
yanked
him
back
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
thanks
ben
said
de
nada
in
the
oold
ddays
you
wulhould
have
puhpulled
me
ihin
aaafter
you
d
down
this
wuh
way
ben
nodded
and
led
them
along
the
overgrown
bank
fighting
through
he
tangles
of
bushes
and
brambles
thinking
how
much
easier
this
was
when
you
were
only
four
feet
five
and
able
to
go
under
most
tangles
those
in
your
mind
as
well
as
those
in
your
path
he
supposed
in
one
nonchalant
duck
well
everything
changed
our
ksson
for
today
boys
and
girls
is
the
more
things
change
the
more
things
change
whoever
said
the
more
things
change
the
more
things
stay
the
same
was
obviously
suffering
severe
mental
retardation
because
his
foot
hooked
under
something
and
he
fell
over
with
a
thud
nearly
striking
his
head
on
the
pumpingstation
concrete
cylinder
it
was
almost
completely
buried
in
a
wallow
of
blackberry
bushes
as
he
got
to
his
feet
again
he
realized
that
his
face
and
arms
and
hands
had
been
striped
by
blackberry
thorns
in
two
dozen
places
make
that
three
dozen
he
said
feeling
thin
blood
running
down
his
cheeks
what
eddie
asked
nothing
he
bent
down
to
see
what
he
had
tripped
over
a
root
probably
but
it
wasn't
a
root
it
was
the
iron
manhole
cover
someone
had
pushed
it
off
of
course
ben
thought
we
did
twentyseven
years
ago
but
he
realized
that
was
crazy
even
before
he
saw
fresh
metal
twinkling
through
the
rust
in
parallel
scrapemarks
the
pump
hadn't
been
working
that
day
sooner
or
later
someone
would
have
come
down
to
fix
it
and
would
have
replaced
the
cover
in
the
bargain
he
stood
up
and
the
five
of
them
gathered
around
the
cylinder
and
looked
in
they
could
hear
the
faint
sound
of
dripping
water
that
was
all
richie
had
brought
all
the
matches
from
eddie
room
now
he
lit
an
entire
book
of
them
and
tossed
it
in
for
a
moment
they
could
see
the
cylinders
damp
inner
sleeve
and
the
silent
bulk
of
the
pumping
machinery
that
was
all
could
have
been
off
for
a
long
time
richie
said
uneasily
didn't
necessarily
have
to
happen
it
happened
fairly
recently
ben
said
since
the
last
rain
anyway
he
took
another
book
of
matches
from
richie
lit
one
and
pointed
out
the
fresh
scratches
there
suh
suh
something
ub
under
it
bill
said
as
ben
shook
out
the
match
wha
ben
asked
cccouldn't
tuhtuhtell
looked
like
a
struhstruhstrap
you
and
rihrichie
help
me
tturn
it
o
over
they
grabbed
the
cover
and
flipped
it
like
a
giant
coin
this
time
beverly
lit
the
match
and
ben
cautiously
picked
up
the
purse
which
had
been
under
the
manhole
cover
he
held
it
up
by
the
strap
beverly
started
to
shake
out
the
match
and
then
looked
at
bill
face
she
froze
until
the
flame
touched
the
ends
of
her
fingers
and
then
dropped
it
with
a
little
gasp
bill
what
is
it
what
wrong
bill
eyes
felt
too
heavy
they
couldn't
leave
that
scuffed
leather
bag
with
its
long
leather
strap
suddenly
he
could
remember
the
name
of
the
song
which
had
been
playing
on
the
radio
in
the
back
room
of
the
leather
goods
shop
when
he
had
bought
it
for
her
sausalito
summer
nights
it
was
the
surpassing
weirdism
all
the
spit
was
gone
out
of
his
mouth
leaving
his
tongue
and
inner
cheeks
as
smooth
and
dry
as
chrome
he
could
hear
the
crickets
and
see
the
lightningbugs
and
smell
big
green
growing
dark
out
of
control
all
around
him
and
he
thought
it
another
trick
another
illusion
she
in
england
and
this
is
just
a
cheap
shot
because
it
scared
oh
yes
it
maybe
not
as
sure
as
it
was
when
it
called
us
all
back
and
really
bill
get
serious
how
many
scuffed
leather
purses
with
long
straps
do
you
think
there
are
in
the
world
a
million
ten
million
probably
more
but
only
one
like
this
he
had
bought
it
for
audra
in
a
burbank
leather
goods
store
while
sausalito
summer
night
played
on
the
radio
in
the
back
room
bill
beverly
hand
on
his
shoulder
shaking
him
far
away
twentyseven
leagues
under
the
sea
what
was
the
name
of
the
group
that
sang
sausalito
summer
nights
richie
would
know
know
bill
said
calmly
into
richie
scared
wideeyed
face
and
smiled
it
was
diesel
how
that
for
total
recall
bill
what
wrong
richie
whispered
bill
screamed
he
snatched
the
matches
out
of
beverly
hand
lit
one
and
then
yanked
the
purse
away
from
ben
bill
jesus
what
he
unzipped
the
purse
and
turned
it
over
what
fell
out
was
so
much
audra
that
for
a
moment
he
was
too
unmanned
to
scream
again
amid
the
kleenex
sticks
of
chewing
gum
and
items
of
makeup
he
saw
a
tin
of
altoid
mints
and
the
jewelled
compact
freddie
firestone
had
given
her
when
she
signed
for
attic
room
my
wuhwuhwife
down
there
he
said
and
fell
on
his
knees
and
began
pushing
her
things
back
into
the
purse
he
brushed
hair
that
no
longer
existed
out
of
his
eyes
without
even
thinking
about
it
your
wife
audra
beverly
face
was
shocked
her
eyes
huge
her
pp
purse
her
th
things
jesus
bill
richie
muttered
that
can't
be
you
know
th
he
had
found
her
alligator
wallet
he
opened
it
and
held
it
up
richie
lit
another
match
and
was
looking
at
a
face
he
had
seen
in
half
a
dozen
movies
the
picture
on
audra
california
driver
license
was
less
glamorous
but
completely
conclusive
but
hub
hub
henry
dead
and
victor
and
bbbelch
so
who
got
her
he
stood
up
staring
around
at
them
with
febrile
intensity
who
got
he
ben
put
a
hand
on
bill
shoulder
i
guess
we
better
go
down
and
find
out
huh
bill
looked
around
at
hull
as
if
unsure
of
who
ben
might
be
and
then
his
eyes
cleared
y
yea
he
said
eheh
eddie
bill
i'm
sorry
can
you
cluhclimb
on
i
did
once
bill
bent
over
and
eddie
hooked
his
right
arm
around
bill
neck
ben
and
richie
boosted
him
up
until
he
could
hook
his
legs
around
bill
midsection
as
bill
swung
one
leg
clumsily
over
the
lip
of
the
cylinder
ben
saw
that
eddie
eyes
were
tightly
shut
and
for
a
moment
he
thought
he
heard
the
world
ugliest
cavalry
charge
bashing
its
way
through
the
bushes
he
turned
expecting
to
see
the
three
of
them
come
out
of
the
fog
and
the
brambles
but
all
he
had
heard
was
the
rising
breeze
rattling
the
bamboo
a
quarter
of
a
mile
or
so
from
here
their
old
enemies
were
all
gone
now
bill
gripped
the
rough
concrete
lip
of
the
cylinder
and
felt
his
way
down
step
by
step
and
rung
by
rung
eddie
had
him
in
a
deathgrip
and
bill
could
barely
breathe
her
purse
dear
god
how
did
her
purse
get
here
doesn't
matter
but
if
you're
there
god
and
if
you're
taking
requests
let
her
be
all
right
don't
let
her
suffer
for
what
bev
and
i
did
tonight
or
for
what
i
did
one
summer
when
i
was
a
boy
and
was
it
the
clown
was
it
bob
gray
who
got
her
if
it
was
i
don't
know
if
even
god
can
help
her
tm
scared
bill
eddie
said
in
a
thin
voice
bill
foot
touched
cold
standing
water
he
lowered
himself
into
it
remembering
the
feel
and
the
dank
smell
remembering
the
claustrophobic
way
this
place
had
made
him
feel
and
just
by
the
way
what
had
happened
to
them
how
had
they
fared
down
in
these
drains
and
tunnels
where
exactly
had
they
gone
and
how
exactly
had
they
gotten
out
again
he
still
couldn't
remember
any
of
that
all
he
could
think
of
was
audra
i
am
tttoo
he
halfsquatted
wincing
as
the
cold
water
ran
into
his
pants
and
over
his
balls
and
let
eddie
off
they
stood
shindeep
in
the
water
and
watched
the
others
descend
the
ladder
chapter
under
the
city
it
/
august
something
new
had
happened
for
the
first
time
in
forever
something
new
before
the
universe
there
had
been
only
two
things
one
was
itself
and
the
other
was
the
turtle
the
turtle
was
a
stupid
old
thing
that
never
came
out
of
its
shell
it
thought
that
maybe
the
turtle
was
dead
had
been
dead
for
the
last
billion
years
or
so
even
if
it
wasn't
it
was
still
a
stupid
old
thing
and
even
if
the
turtle
had
vomited
the
universe
out
whole
that
didn't
change
the
fact
of
its
stupidity
it
had
come
here
long
after
the
turtle
withdrew
into
its
shell
here
to
earth
and
it
had
discovered
a
depth
of
imagination
here
that
was
almost
new
almost
of
concern
this
quality
of
imagination
made
the
food
very
rich
its
teeth
rent
flesh
gone
stiff
with
exotic
terrors
and
voluptuous
fears
they
dreamed
of
nightbeasts
and
moving
muds
against
their
will
they
contemplated
endless
gulphs
upon
this
rich
food
it
existed
in
a
simple
cycle
of
waking
to
eat
and
sleeping
to
dream
it
had
created
a
place
in
its
own
image
and
it
looked
upon
this
place
with
favor
from
the
deadlights
which
were
its
eyes
derry
was
its
killingpen
the
people
of
derry
its
sheep
things
had
gone
on
then
these
children
something
new
for
the
first
time
in
forever
when
it
had
burst
up
into
the
house
on
neibolt
street
meaning
to
kill
them
all
vaguely
uneasy
that
it
had
not
been
able
to
do
so
already
and
surely
that
unease
had
been
the
first
new
thing
something
had
happened
which
was
totally
unexpected
utterly
unthought
of
and
there
had
been
pain
pain
great
roaring
pain
all
through
the
shape
it
had
taken
and
for
one
moment
there
had
also
been
fear
because
the
only
thing
it
had
in
common
with
the
stupid
old
turtle
and
the
cosmology
of
the
macroverse
outside
the
puny
egg
of
this
universe
was
just
this
all
living
things
must
abide
by
the
laws
of
the
shape
they
inhabit
for
the
first
time
it
realized
that
perhaps
its
ability
to
change
its
shapes
might
work
against
it
as
well
as
for
it
there
had
never
been
pain
before
there
had
never
been
fear
before
and
for
a
moment
it
had
thought
it
might
die
oh
its
head
had
been
filled
with
a
great
white
silver
pain
and
it
had
roared
and
mewled
and
bellowed
and
somehow
the
children
had
escaped
but
now
they
were
coming
they
had
entered
its
domain
under
the
city
seven
foolish
children
blundering
through
the
darkness
without
lights
or
weapons
it
would
kill
them
now
surely
it
had
made
a
great
selfdiscovery
it
did
not
want
change
or
surprise
it
did
not
want
new
things
ever
it
wanted
only
to
eat
and
sleep
and
dream
and
eat
again
following
the
pain
and
that
brief
bright
fear
another
new
emotion
had
arisen
as
all
genuine
emotions
were
new
to
it
although
it
was
a
great
mocker
of
emotions
anger
it
would
kill
the
children
because
they
had
by
some
amazing
accident
hurt
it
but
it
would
make
them
suffer
first
because
for
one
brief
moment
they
had
made
it
fear
them
come
to
me
then
it
thought
listening
to
their
approach
come
to
me
children
and
see
how
we
float
down
here
how
we
all
float
and
yet
there
was
a
thought
that
insinuated
itself
no
matter
how
strongly
it
tried
to
push
the
thought
away
it
was
simply
this
if
all
things
flowed
from
it
as
they
surely
had
done
since
the
turtle
sicked
up
the
universe
and
then
fainted
inside
its
shell
how
could
any
creature
of
this
or
any
other
world
fool
it
or
hurt
it
no
matter
how
briefly
or
triflingly
how
was
that
possible
and
so
a
last
new
thing
had
come
to
it
this
not
an
emotion
but
a
cold
speculation
suppose
it
had
not
been
alone
as
it
had
always
believed
suppose
there
was
another
and
suppose
further
that
these
children
were
agents
of
that
other
suppose
suppose
it
began
to
tremble
hate
was
new
hun
was
new
being
crossed
in
its
purpose
was
new
but
the
most
terrible
new
thing
was
this
fear
not
fear
of
the
children
that
had
passed
but
the
fear
of
not
being
alone
no
there
was
no
other
surely
there
was
not
perhaps
because
they
were
children
their
imaginations
had
a
certain
raw
power
it
had
briefly
underestimated
but
now
that
they
were
coming
it
would
let
them
come
they
would
come
and
it
would
cast
them
one
by
one
into
the
macroverse
into
the
deadlights
of
its
eyes
yes
when
they
got
here
it
would
cast
them
shrieking
and
insane
into
the
deadlights
in
the
tunnels
/
p.m
bev
and
richie
had
maybe
ten
matches
between
them
but
bill
wouldn't
let
them
use
them
for
the
time
being
at
least
there
was
still
dim
light
in
the
dram
not
much
but
he
could
make
out
the
next
four
feet
in
front
of
him
and
as
long
as
he
could
keep
doing
that
they
would
save
the
matches
he
supposed
the
little
light
they
were
getting
must
be
coming
from
vents
in
curbings
over
their
heads
maybe
even
from
the
circular
vents
in
manhole
covers
it
seemed
surpassingly
strange
to
think
they
were
under
the
city
but
of
course
by
now
they
must
be
the
water
was
deeper
now
three
times
dead
animals
had
floated
past
a
rat
a
kitten
a
bloated
shiny
thing
that
might
have
been
a
woodchuck
he
heard
one
of
the
others
mutter
disgustedly
as
that
baby
cruised
by
the
water
they
were
crawling
through
was
relatively
placid
but
all
that
was
going
to
come
to
an
end
fiirly
soon
there
was
a
steady
hollow
roaring
not
too
far
up
ahead
it
grew
louder
rising
to
a
onenote
roar
the
drain
elbowed
to
the
right
they
made
the
turn
and
here
were
three
pipes
spewing
water
into
their
pipe
they
were
lined
up
vertically
like
the
lenses
on
a
traffic
light
the
drain
deadended
here
the
light
was
marginally
brighter
bill
looked
up
and
saw
they
were
in
a
square
stonefaced
shaft
about
fifteen
feet
high
there
was
a
sewergrating
up
there
and
water
was
sloshing
down
on
them
in
buckets
it
was
like
being
in
a
primitive
shower
bill
surveyed
the
three
pipes
helplessly
the
top
one
was
venting
water
which
was
almost
clear
although
there
were
leaves
and
sticks
and
bits
of
trash
in
it
cigarette
butts
chewing
gum
wrappers
things
like
that
the
middle
pipe
was
venting
gray
water
and
from
the
lowest
one
came
a
grayish
brown
flood
of
lumpy
sewage
eh
eh
eddie
eddie
floundered
up
beside
him
his
hair
was
plastered
to
his
head
his
cast
was
a
soaking
drippy
mess
wh
wh
which
wub
wuhon
if
you
wanted
to
know
how
to
build
something
you
asked
ben
if
you
wanted
to
know
which
way
to
go
you
asked
eddie
they
didn't
talk
about
this
but
they
all
knew
it
if
you
were
in
a
strange
neighborhood
and
wanted
to
get
back
to
a
place
you
knew
eddie
could
get
you
there
making
lefts
and
rights
with
undiminished
confidence
until
you
were
reduced
simply
to
following
him
and
hoping
that
things
would
turn
out
right
which
they
always
seemed
to
do
bill
told
richie
once
that
when
he
and
eddie
first
began
to
play
in
the
barrens
he
bill
was
constantly
afraid
of
getting
lost
eddie
had
no
such
fears
and
he
always
brought
the
two
of
them
out
right
where
he
said
he
was
going
to
if
i
gg
got
luhlost
in
the
hainesville
woods
and
eheddie
was
with
me
i
wouldn't

cuhhuhhompass
in
their
heads

|llike
that

yo
eddie
shouted
i
said
wh
which
one
which
one
what
eddie
had
his
aspirator
clutched
in
his
good
hand
and
bill
thought
he
actually
looked
more
like
a
drowned
muskrat
than
a
kid
which
one
do
we
tuhtuhtak
well
that
all
depends
on
where
we
want
to
go
eddie
said
and
bill
could
have
cheerfully
throttled
him
even
though
the
question
made
perfect
sense
eddie
was
looking
dubiously
at
the
three
pipes
they
could
fit
into
all
of
them
but
the
bottom
one
looked
pretty
snug
bill
motioned
the
others
to
move
up
into
a
circle
where
the
fuck
is
ihihit
he
asked
them
middle
of
town
richie
said
promptly
right
under
the
middle
of
town
near
the
canal
beverly
was
nodding
so
was
ben
so
was
stan
muhmuh
mike
ye
he
said
that
where
it
is
near
the
canal
or
under
it
bill
looked
back
at
eddie
w
w
which
one
eddie
pointed
reluctantly
at
the
lower
pipe
and
although
bill
heart
sank
he
wasn't
at
all
surprised
that
one
oh
gross
stan
said
unhappily
that
a
shitpipe
we
don't
mike
began
and
then
broke
off
he
cocked
his
head
in
a
listening
gesture
his
eyes
were
alarmed
what
bill
began
and
mike
put
a
finger
across
his
lips
in
a
shhhh
gesture
now
bill
could
hear
it
too
splashing
sounds
approaching
grunts
and
muffled
words
henry
still
hadn't
given
up
quick
ben
said
let
go
stan
looked
back
the
way
they
had
come
then
he
looked
at
the
lowest
of
the
three
pipes
he
pressed
his
lips
tightly
together
and
nodded
let
g
he
said

shut
up
beverly
hissed
at
him
bill
led
them
to
the
pipe
grimacing
at
the
smell
and
crawled
in
the
smell
it
was
sewage
it
was
shit
but
there
was
another
smell
here
too
wasn't
there
a
lower
more
vital
smell
if
an
animal
grunt
could
have
a
smell
and
bill
supposed
if
the
animal
in
question
had
been
eating
the
nght
things
it
could
it
would
be
like
this
undersmell
we're
headed
in
the
right
direction
all
right
it
been
here
and
its
been
here
a
lot
by
the
time
they
had
gone
twenty
feet
the
air
had
grown
rancid
and
poisonous
he
squished
slowly
along
moving
through
stuff
that
wasn't
mud
he
looked
back
over
his
shoulder
and
said
you
fuhfuhfollow
right
behind
mme
eheh
eddie
i'll
nuhneed
yyou
the
light
faded
to
the
faintest
gray
held
that
way
briefly
and
then
it
was
gone
and
they
were
out
of
the
blue
and
into
the
black
bill
shuffled
forward
through
the
sunk
feeling
that
he
was
almost
cutting
through
it
physically
one
hand
held
out
before
him
part
of
him
expecting
that
at
any
moment
it
would
encounter
rough
hair
and
green
lamplike
eyes
would
open
in
the
darkness
the
end
would
come
in
one
hot
flare
of
pain
as
it
walloped
his
head
off
his
shoulders
the
dark
was
stuffed
with
sounds
all
of
them
magnified
and
echoing
he
could
hear
his
friends
shuffling
along
behind
him
sometimes
muttering
something
there
were
gurglings
and
strange
clanking
groans
once
a
flood
of
sickeningly
warm
water
washed
past
and
between
his
legs
wetting
him
to
the
thighs
and
rocking
him
back
on
his
heels
he
felt
eddie
clutch
frantically
at
the
back
of
his
shirt
and
then
the
small
flood
slackened
from
the
end
of
the
line
richie
bellowed
with
sorry
good
humor
i
think
we
just
been
pissed
on
by
the
jolly
green
giant
bill
bill
could
hear
water
or
sewage
running
in
controlled
bursts
through
the
network
of
smaller
pipes
which
now
must
be
over
their
heads
he
remembered
the
conversation
about
berry
sewers
with
his
father
and
thought
he
knew
what
this
pipe
must
be
it
was
to
handle
the
overflow
that
only
occurred
during
heavy
rains
and
during
the
flood
season
the
stuff
up
there
would
be
leaving
derry
to
be
dumped
in
torrault
stream
and
the
penobscot
river
the
city
didn't
like
to
pump
its
shit
into
the
kenduskeag
because
it
made
the
canal
stink
but
all
the
socalled
gray
water
went
into
the
kenduskeag
and
if
there
was
too
much
for
the
regular
sewerpipes
to
handle
there
would
be
a
dumpoff
like
the
one
that
had
just
happened
if
there
had
been
one
there
could
be
another
he
glanced
up
uneasily
not
able
to
see
anything
but
knowing
that
there
must
be
grates
in
the
top
ach
of
the
pipe
possibly
in
the
sides
as
well
and
that
any
moment
there
might
be
he
wasn't
aware
he'd
reached
the
end
of
the
pipe
until
he
fell
out
of
it
and
staggered
forward
pinwheeling
his
arms
in
a
helpless
effort
to
keep
his
balance
he
fell
on
his
belly
into
a
sem#solid
mass
about
two
feet
below
the
mouth
of
the
pipe
he'd
just
tumbled
out
of
something
ran
squeaking
over
his
hand
he
screamed
and
sat
up
clutching
his
tingling
hand
to
his
chest
aware
that
a
rat
had
just
run
over
it
he
had
felt
the
loathsome
plated
drag
of
the
thing
hairless
tail
he
tried
to
stand
up
and
rapped
his
head
on
the
new
pipe
low
ceiling
it
was
a
hard
hit
and
bill
was
driven
back
to
his
knees
with
large
red
flowers
exploding
in
the
darkness
before
his
eyes
be
cccarefu
he
heard
himself
shouting
his
words
echoed
flatly
it

in
unison
in
the
daylight
the
almost
perfect
harmony
the
three
of
them
made
would
have
been
funny
down
here
in
the
dark
in
the
sewers
it
was
terrifying
suddenly
all
of
them
were
tumbling
out
bill
clutched
eddie
in
a
bear
hug
trying
to
save
his
arm

in
a
trembling
voice
and
they
all
laughed
shrilly
as
the
laughter
was
tapering
off

suddenly
burst
into
miserable
tears

bill
felt
a
hand
touch
his
in
the
darkness
and
press
a
folder
of
matches
into
it
they
felt
dry
kept
them
in
my
armpit
she
said
they
might
work
you
can
try
them
anyway
bill
tore
a
match
out
of
the
folder
and
struck
it
it
popped
alight
and
he
held
it
up
his
friends
were
huddled
together
wincing
at
the
brief
bright
flare
of
light
they
were
splashed
and
daubed
with
ordure
and
they
all
looked
very
young
and
very
afraid
behind
them
he
could
see
the
sewerpipe
they
had
come
out
of
the
pipe
they
were
in
now
was
smaller
still
it
ran
straight
in
both
directions
its
floor
caked
with
layers
of
filthy
sediment
and
he
drew
in
a
quick
hiss
and
shook
the
match
out
as
it
burned
his
fingers
he
listened
and
heard
the
sounds
of
fastrunning
water
dripping
water
the
occasional
gushing
roar
as
the
overflow
valves
worked
sending
more
sewage
into
the
kenduskeag
which
was
now
god
only
knew
how
far
behind
them
he
didn't
hear
henry
and
the
others
yet
he
said
quietly

i
won't
know
which
way
to

bill
lit
the
match
in
its
glow
they
all
saw
the
green
swelled
thing
that
had
been
patrick
hockstetter
the
corpse
grinned
at
them
in
the
dark
with
horrid
chumminess
but
with
only
half
a
face
sewer
rats
had
taken
the
rest
patrick
summerschool
books
were
scattered
around

bloated
to
the
size
of

the
damp
christ
mike
said
hoarsely
his
eyes
wide
i
hear

agai
beverly
said
henry
and
the
others
the
acoustics
must
have
carried
her
voice
to
them
as
well
henry
bellowed
down
the
sewer
pipe
and
for
a
moment
it
was
as
if
he
was
standing
right
there
we'll
getyouuuuuu
you
come
on
right
ahead
richie
shouted
his
eyes
were
bright
dancing
febrile
keep
coming
bananaheels
this
is
just
like
the
ymca
swimming
pool
down
here
keep
then
a
shriek
of
such
mad
fear
and
pain
came
through
the
pipe
that
the
guttering
match
fell
from
bill
fingers
and
went
out
eddie
arm
had
curled
around
him
and
bill
hugged
eddie
back
feeling
his
body
trembling
like
a
wire
as
stan
uris
packed
close
to
him
on
the
other
side
that
shriek
rose
and
rose
and
then
there
was
an
obscene
thick
flapping
noise
and
the
shriek
was
cut
off
something
got
one
of
them
mike
choked
horrified
in
the
darkness
something
some
monster
bill
we
got
to
get
out
of
here
please

bill
could
hear
whoever
was
left
one
or
two
with
the
acoustics
it
was
impossible
to
tell
stumbling
and
scrabbling
through
the
sewerpipe
toward
them
wuhwhich
wwway
eheddi
he
asked
urgertly
d
do
you
nuh
know
toward
the
canal
eddie
asked
shaking
in
bill
arms
yes
to
the
right
past
patrick
or
over
him
eddie
voice
suddenly
hardened
i
don't
care
that
much
he
was
one
of
the
ones
that
broke
my
arm
spit
in
my
face
too
let
guhg
bill
said
looking
back
at
the
sewerpipe
they
had
just
quitted
ssingle
lub
line
keep
a
tttouch
on
eeach
uhuh
other
like
bb
before
he
groped
forward
dragging
his
nght
shoulder
along
the
slimy
porcelain
surface
of
the
pipe
gritting
his
teeth
not
wanting
to
step
on
patrick
or
into
him
so
they
crawled
farther
into
the
darkness
while
waters
rushed
around
them
and
while
outside
the
storm
walked
and
talked
and
brought
an
early
darkness
to
derry
a
darkness
that
screamed
with
wind
and
stuttered
with
electric
fire
and
racketed
with
falling
trees
that
sounded
like
the
death
cries
of
huge
prehistoric
creatures
it
/
may
now
they
were
coming
again
and
while
everything
had
gone
much
as
it
had
foreseen
something
it
had
not
foreseen
had
returned
that
maddening
galling
fear
that
sense
of
another
it
hated
the
fear
would
have
turned
on
it
and
eaten
it
if
it
could
have
but
the
fear
danced
mockingly
out
of
reach
and
it
could
only
kill
the
fear
by
kitting
them
surely
there
was
no
need
for
such
fear
they
were
older
now
and
their
number
had
been
reduced
from
seven
to
five
five
was
a
number
of
power
but
it
did
not
have
the
mystical
talismanic
quality
of
seven
it
was
true
that
its
dogsbody
hadn't
been
able
to
kill
the
librarian
but
the
librarian
would
die
in
the
hospital
later
just
before
dawn
touched
the
sky
it
would
send
a
male
nurse
with
a
bad
pill
habit
to
finish
the
librarian
once
and
for
all
the
writer
woman
was
now
with
it
alive
yet
not
alive
her
mind
had
been
utterly
destroyed
by
her
first
sight
of
it
as
it
really
was
with
all
of
its
little
masks
and
glamours
thrown
aside
and
all
of
the
glamours
were
only
mirrors
of
course
throwing
back
at
the
terrified
viewer
the
worst
thing
in
his
or
her
own
mind
heliographing
images
as
a
mirror
may
bounce
a
reflection
of
the
sun
into
a
wide
unsuspecting
eye
and
stun
it
to
blindness
now
the
mind
of
the
writer
wife
was
with
it
in
it
beyond
the
end
of
the
macroverse
in
the
darkness
beyond
the
turtle
in
the
outlands
beyond
all
lands
she
was
in
its
eye
she
was
in
its
mind
she
was
in
the
deadlights
oh
but
the
glamours
were
amusing
hanlon
for
instance
he
would
not
remember
not
consciously
but
his
mother
could
have
told
him
where
the
bird
he
had
seen
at
the
ironworks
came
from
when
he
was
a
baby
only
six
months
old
his
mother
had
left
him
sleeping
in
his
cradle
in
the
side
yard
while
she
went
around
back
to
hang
sheets
and
diapers
on
the
line
his
screams
had
brought
her
on
the
run
a
large
crow
had
lighted
on
the
edge
of
the
carriage
and
was
pecking
at
baby
mikey
like
an
evil
creature
in
a
nursery
tale
he
had
been
screaming
in
pain
and
terror
unable
to
drive
away
the
crow
which
had
sensed
weak
prey
she
had
struck
the
bird
with
her
fist
and
driven
it
off
seen
that
it
had
brought
blood
in
two
or
three
places
on
baby
mikey
arms
and
taken
him
to
dr
stillwagon
for
a
tetanus
shot
a
part
of
mike
had
remembered
that
always
tiny
baby
giant
bird
and
when
it
came
to
mike
mike
had
seen
the
giant
bird
again
but
when
the
dogsbody
husband
of
the
girl
from
before
brought
the
writer
woman
it
had
put
on
no
face
it
did
not
dress
when
it
was
at
home
the
dogsbody
husband
had
looked
once
ad
had
dropped
dead
of
shock
his
face
gray
his
eyes
filling
with
the
blood
that
had
squirted
out
of
his
brain
in
a
dozen
places
the
writer
woman
had
put
out
one
powerful
horrified
thought
oh
dear
jesus
it
is
female
and
then
all
thoughts
ceased
she
swam
in
the
deadlights
it
came
down
from
its
place
and
took
care
of
her
physical
remains
prepared
them
for
later
feeding
now
audra
denbrough
hung
high
up
in
the
middle
of
things
crisscrossed
in
silk
her
head
lolling
against
the
socket
of
her
shoulder
her
eyes
wide
and
glazed
her
toes
pointing
down
but
there
was
still
power
in
them
diminished
but
still
there
they
had
come
here
as
children
and
somehow
against
all
the
odds
against
all
that
was
supposed
to
be
all
that
could
be
they
had
hurt
it
badly
had
almost
killed
it
had
forced
it
to
flee
deep
into
the
earth
where
it
huddled
hurt
and
hating
and
trembling
in
a
spreading
pool
of
its
own
strange
blood
so
another
new
thing
if
you
please
for
the
first
time
in
its
neverending
history
it
needed
to
make
a
plan
for
the
first
time
it
found
itself
afraid
simply
to
take
what
it
wanted
from
derry
its
private
gamepreserve
it
had
always
fed
well
on
children
many
adults
could
be
used
without
knowing
they
had
been
used
and
it
had
even
fed
on
a
few
of
the
older
ones
over
the
years
adults
had
their
own
terrors
and
their
glands
could
be
tapped
opened
so
that
all
the
chemicals
of
fear
flooded
the
body
and
salted
the
meat
but
their
fears
were
mostly
too
complex
the
fears
of
children
were
simpler
and
usually
more
powerful
the
fears
of
children
could
often
be
summoned
up
in
a
single
face
and
if
bait
were
needed
why
what
child
did
not
love
a
clown
it
understood
vaguely
that
these
children
had
somehow
turned
its
own
tools
against
it
that
by
coincidence
surely
not
on
purpose
surely
not
guided
by
the
hand
of
any
other
by
the
bonding
of
seven
extraordinarily
imaginative
minds
it
had
been
drought
into
a
zone
of
great
danger
any
of
these
seven
alone
would
have
been
its
meat
and
drink
and
if
they
had
not
happened
to
come
together
it
surely
would
have
picked
them
off
one
by
one
drawn
by
the
quality
of
their
minds
just
as
a
lion
might
be
drawn
to
one
particular
waterhole
by
the
scent
of
zebra
but
together
they
had
discovered
an
alarming
secret
that
even
it
had
not
been
aware
of
that
belief
has
a
second
edge
if
there
are
ten
thousand
medieval
peasants
who
create
vampires
by
believing
them
real
there
may
be
one
probably
a
child
who
will
imagine
the
stake
necessary
to
kill
it
but
a
stake
is
only
stupid
wood
the
mind
is
the
mallet
which
drives
it
home
yet
in
the
end
it
had
escaped
had
gone
deep
and
the
exhausted
terrified
children
had
elected
not
to
follow
it
when
it
was
at
its
most
vulnerable
they
had
elected
to
believe
it
dead
or
dying
and
had
retreated
it
was
aware
of
their
oath
and
had
known
they
would
come
back
just
as
a
lion
knows
the
zebra
will
eventually
return
to
the
waterhole
it
had
begun
to
plan
even
as
it
began
to
drowse
when
it
woke
it
would
be
healed
renewed
but
their
childhoods
would
be
burned
away
like
seven
fatty
candles
the
former
power
of
their
imaginations
would
be
muted
and
weak
they
would
no
longer
imagine
that
there
were
piranha
in
the
kenduskeag
or
that
if
you
stepped
on
a
crack
you
might
really
break
your
mother
back
or
that
if
you
killed
a
ladybug
which
lit
on
your
shin
your
house
would
catch
fire
that
night
instead
they
would
believe
in
insurance
instead
they
would
believe
in
wine
with
dinner
something
nice
but
not
too
pretentious
like
a
pouillyfuissé
and
let
that
breathe
waiter
would
you
instead
they
would
believe
that
rolaids
consume
fortyseven
times
their
own
weight
in
excess
stomach
acid
instead
they
would
believe
in
public
television
gary
hart
mnning
to
prevent
heart
attacks
giving
up
red
meat
to
prevent
colon
cancer
they
would
believe
in
dr
ruth
when
it
came
to
getting
well
fucked
and
jerry
falwell
when
it
came
to
getting
well
saved
as
each
year
passed
their
dreams
would
grow
smaller
and
when
it
woke
it
would
call
them
back
yes
back
because
fear
was
fertile
its
child
was
rage
and
rage
cried
for
revenge
it
would
call
them
and
then
kill
them
only
now
that
they
were
coming
the
fear
had
returned
they
had
grown
up
and
their
imaginations
had
weakened
but
not
as
much
as
it
had
believed
it
had
felt
an
ominous
upsetting
growth
in
their
power
when
they
joined
together
and
it
had
wondered
for
the
first
time
if
it
had
perhaps
made
a
mistake
but
why
be
gloomy
the
die
was
castand
not
all
the
omens
were
bad
the
writer
was
half
mad
for
his
wife
and
that
was
good
the
writer
was
the
strongest
the
one
who
had
somehow
trained
his
mind
for
this
confrontation
over
all
the
years
and
when
the
writer
was
dead
with
his
guts
falling
out
of
his
body
when
their
precious
big
bil
was
dead
the
others
would
be
its
quickly
it
would
feed
well
and
then
perhaps
it
would
go
deep
again
and
doze
for
awhile
in
the
tunnels
/
a.m
bill
richie
shouted
into
the
echoing
pipe
he
was
moving
as
fast
as
he
could
but
that
wasn't
very
fast
he
remembered
that
as
kids
they
had
walked
bent
over
in
this
pipe
which
led
away
from
the
pumpingstation
in
the
barrens
he
was
crawling
now
and
the
pipe
seemed
impossibly
tight
his
glasses
kept
wanting
to
slide
off
the
end
of
his
nose
and
he
kept
pushing
them
up
again
he
could
hear
bev
and
ben
behind
him
bil
he
bawled
again
eddi
tm
here
eddie
voice
floated
back
where
bill
richie
shouted
up
ahead
eddie
called
he
was
very
close
now
and
richie
sensed
rather
than
saw
him
just
ahead
he
wouldn't
wait
richie
head
butted
eddie
leg
a
moment
later
bev
head
butted
richie
ass
bill
richie
screamed
at
the
top
of
his
voice
the
pipe
channelled
his
shout
and
sent
it
back
at
him
hurting
his
own
ears
bill
wait
for
us
we
have
to
go
together
don't
you
know
tha
faintly
echoing
bill
audra
audra
where
are
yo
goddam
you
big
bill
richie
cried
softly
his
glasses
fell
off
he
cursed
groped
for
them
and
set
them
dripping
back
on
his
nose
he
pulled
in
breath
and
shouted
again
you'll
get
lost
without
eddie
you
fucking
asshole
wait
up
wait
up
for
us
you
hear
me
bill
wait
up
for
us
dammit
there
was
an
agonizing
moment
of
silence
it
seemed
that
no
one
breathed
all
richie
could
hear
was
distant
dripping
water
the
drain
was
dry
this
time
except
for
the
occasional
stagnant
puddle
bill
he
ran
a
trembling
hand
through
his
hair
and
fought
the
tears
come
on
please
man
wait
up
please
and
fainter
still
bill
voice
came
back
t'm
waiting
thank
god
for
small
favors
richie
muttered
he
slapped
eddie
can
go
i
don't
know
how
long
i
can
with
just
one
arm
eddie
said
apologetically
go
anyway
richie
said
and
eddie
began
crawling
again
bill
looking
haggard
and
almost
usedup
was
waiting
for
them
in
the
sewershaft
where
the
three
pipes
were
lined
up
like
lenses
on
a
dead
traffic
light
there
was
room
enough
here
for
them
to
stand
up
over
there
bill
said
cuhcriss
and
bbbelch
they
looked
beverly
moaned
and
ben
put
an
arm
around
her
the
skeleton
of
belch
huggins
clad
in
moldering
rags
seemed
more
or
less
intact
what
remained
of
victor
was
headless
bill
looked
across
the
shaftway
and
saw
a
grinning
skull
there
it
was
there
was
the
rest
of
him
should
have
left
it
alone
guys
bill
thought
and
shivered
this
section
of
the
sewer
system
had
fallen
into
disuse
richie
thought
the
reason
why
was
pretty
clear
the
wastetreatment
plant
had
taken
over
sometime
during
the
years
when
they
were
all
busy
learning
to
shave
to
drive
to
smoke
to
fuck
around
a
little
all
that
good
shit
the
environmental
protection
agency
had
come
into
being
and
the
epa
had
decided
dumping
raw
sewage
and
even
gray
water
into
rivers
and
streams
was
a
nono
so
this
part
of
the
sewer
system
had
simply
moldered
and
the
bodies
of
victor
criss
and
belch
huggins
had
moldered
along
with
it
like
peter
pan
wild
boys
victor
and
belch
had
never
grown
up
here
were
the
skeletons
of
two
boys
in
the
shredded
remains
of
teeshirts
and
jeans
that
had
rotted
away
to
rags
moss
had
grown
over
the
warped
xylophone
of
victor
ribcage
and
over
the
eagle
on
the
buckle
of
his
garrisonbelt
monster
got
e
ben
said
softly
do
you
remember
we
heard
it
happen
audra
ddead
bill
voice
was
mechanical
i
know
it
you
don't
know
any
such
thing
beverly
said
with
such
fury
that
bill
stirred
and
looked
at
her
all
you
know
for
sure
is
that
a
lot
of
other
people
have
died
most
of
them
children
she
walked
across
to
him
and
stood
before
him
with
her
hands
on
her
hips
her
face
and
hands
were
streaked
with
grime
her
hair
matted
with
dirt
richie
thought
she
looked
absolutely
magnificent
and
you
know
what
did
it
i
nuhnever
should
have
tttold
her
where
i
was
guhgoin
bill
said
why
did
i
do
that
why
did
i
her
hands
pistoned
out
and
seized
him
by
the
shirt
amazed
richie
watched
as
she
shook
him
no
more
you
know
what
we
came
for
we
swore
and
we're
going
to
do
it
do
you
understand
me
bill
if
she

dead
but
it
not
now
we
need
you

get
it
we

you
she
was
crying
now
so
you
stand
up
for
us
you
stand
up
for
us
like
before
or
none
of
us
are
going
to
get
out
of
here
he
looked
at
her
for
a
long
time
without
speaking
and
richie
found
himself
thinking
come
on
big
bill
come
on
come
on
bill
looked
around
at
the
rest
of
them
and
nodded
eheddie
tm
here
bill
ddo
y
you
still
ruahremember
which
pppip
eddie
pointed
past
victor
and
said
that
the
one
looks
pretty
small
doesn't
it
bill
nodded
again
can
you
do
it
with
your
aa
arm
broken
i
can
for
you
bill
bill
smiled
the
weariest
most
terrible
smile
richie
had
ever
seen
tuhhake
us
there
eh
eddie
let
g
get
it
done
in
the
tunnels
/
a.m
as
he
crawled
bill
reminded
himself
of
the
dropoff
at
the
end
of
this
pipe
but
it
still
surprised
him
at
one
moment
his
hands
were
shuffling
along
the
crusted
surface
of
the
old
pipe
at
the
next
they
were
skating
on
air
he
pitched
forward
and
rolled
instinctively
landing
on
his
shoulder
with
a
painful
crunch
be
cccarefu
he
heard
himself
shouting
here
the
druhhopoff
eh
eheddi
her
one
of
eddie
waving
hands
brushed
across
bill
forehead
can
you
help
me
out
he
got
his
arms
around
eddie
and
lifted
him
out
trying
to
be
careful
of
the
bad
am
ben
came
next
then
bev
then
richie
you
got
any
muhmuh
matches
ruhrichi
do
beverly
said
bill
felt
a
hand
touch
his
in
the
darkness
and
press
a
folder
of
matches
into
it
there
only
eight
or
ten
but
ben
got
more
from
the
room
bill
said
did
you
keep
them
in
your
aa
armpit
bbev
not
this
time
she
said
and
put
her
arms
around
him
in
the
dark
he
hugged
her
tight
eyes
closed
trying
to
take
the
comfort
that
she
wanted
so
badly
to
give
he
released
her
gently
and
struck
a
match
the
power
of
memory
was
great
they
all
looked
at
once
to
their
right
what
remained
of
patrick
hockstetter
body
was
still
there
amid
a
few
lumpy
overgrown
things
that
might
have
been
books
the
only
really
recognizable
thing
was
a
jutting
semicircle
of
teeth
two
or
three
of
them
with
fillings
and
something
nearby
a
gleaming
circle
barely
seen
in
the
match
guttering
light
bill
shook
the
match
out
and
lit
another
he
picked
it
up
audra
wedding
ring
he
said
his
voice
was
hollow
expressionless
the
match
went
out
in
his
ringers
in
the
darkness
he
put
the
ring
on
bill
richie
said
hesitantly
do
you
have
any
idea
in
the
tunnels
/
p.m
how
long
they
had
been
wandering
through
the
tunnels
under
derry
since
they
had
left
the
place
where
patrick
hockstetter
body
was
but
bill
was
sure
he
could
never
find
his
way
back
he
kept
thinking
about
what
his
father
had
said
you
could
wander
for
weeks
if
eddie
sense
of
direction
failed
them
now
they
wouldn't
need
it
to
kill
them
they
would
wander
until
they
died
or
if
they
got
into
the
wrong
set
of
pipes
until
they
were
drowned
like
rats
in
arainbarrel
but
eddie
didn't
seem
a
bit
worried
every
now
and
then
he
would
ask
bill
to
light
one
of
their
diminishing
store
of
matches
look
around
thoughtfully
and
then
set
off
again
he
made
rights
and
lefts
seemingly
at
random
sometimes
the
pipes
were
so
big
bill
could
not
reach
their
tops
even
by
stretching
his
hand
up
all
the
way
sometimes
they
had
to
crawl
and
once
for
five
horrible
minutes
which
felt
more
like
five
hours
they
wormed
their
way
along
on
their
bellies
eddie
now
leading
the
others
following
with
their
noses
to
the
heels
of
the
person
ahead
the
only
thing
bill
was
completely
sure
of
was
that
they
had
somehow
gotten
into
a
disused
section
of
the
derry
sewer
system
they
had
left
all
the
active
pipes
either
far
behind
or
far
above
the
roar
of
running
water
had
dimmed
to
a
faroff
thunder
these
pipes
were
older
not
kilnfired
ceramic
but
a
crumbly
claylike
stuff
that
sometimes
oozed
springs
of
unpleasantsmelling
fluid
the
smells
of
human
waste
those
ripe
gassy
smells
that
had
threatened
to
suffocate
them
all
had
faded
but
they
had
been
replaced
by
another
smell
yellow
and
ancient
that
was
worse
ben
thought
it
was
the
smell
of
the
mummy
to
eddie
it
smelled
like
the
leper
richie
thought
it
smelled
like
the
world
oldest
flannel
jacket
now
moldering
and
rotting
a
lumberman
jacket
a
very
big
one
big
enough
for
a
character
like
paul
bunyan
perhaps
to
beverly
it
smelled
like
her
father
sockdrawer
in
stan
uris
it
woke
a
dreadful
memory
from
his
earliest
childhood
an
oddly
jewish
memory
in
a
boy
who
had
only
the
haziest
understanding
of
his
own
jewishness
it
smelled
like
clay
mixed
with
oil
and
made
him
think
of
an
eyeless
mouthless
demon
called
the
golem
a
clay
man
that
renegade
jews
were
supposed
to
have
raised
in
the
middle
ages
to
save
them
from
the
goyim
who
robbed
them
and
raped
their
women
and
then
sent
them
packing
mike
thought
of
the
dry
smell
of
feathers
in
a
dead
nest
when
they
finally
reached
the
end
of
the
narrow
pipe
they
slithered
like
eels
down
the
curved
surface
of
another
which
ran
at
an
oblique
angle
to
the
one
they
had
been
in
and
found
they
could
stand
up
again
bill
felt
the
heads
of
the
matches
left
in
the
book
four
his
mouth
tightened
and
he
resolved
not
to
tell
the
others
how
close
they
were
to
the
end
of
their
light
not
unless
he
absolutely
had
to
huhhuhhow
you
gg
guys
ddoi
they
murmured
replies
and
he
nodded
in
the
dark
no
panic
and
no
tears
since
stan
that
was
good
he
felt
for
their
hands
and
they
stood
together
in
the
dark
that
way
for
awhile
both
taking
and
giving
from
the
touch
bill
felt
clear
exultation
in
this
a
sure
sense
that
they
were
somehow
producing
more
than
the
sum
of
their
seven
selves
they
had
been
readded
into
a
more
potent
whole
he
lit
one
of
the
remaining
matches
and
they
saw
a
narrow
tunnel
stretching
ahead
on
a
downward
slant
the
top
of
this
pipe
was
festooned
with
sagging
cobwebs
some
water
broken
and
hanging
in
shrouds
looking
at
them
gave
bill
an
atavistic
chill
the
floor
here
was
dry
but
thick
with
ancient
mold
and
what
might
have
been
leaves
fungus
or
some
unimaginable
droppings
farther
up
he
saw
a
pile
of
bones
and
a
drift
of
green
rags
they
might
once
have
been
that
stuff
they
called
polished
cotton
workman
clothes
bill
imagined
some
sewer
department
or
water
department
worker
who
had
gotten
lost
wandered
down
here
and
been
discovered
the
match
guttered
he
tipped
its
head
downward
wanting
the
light
to
last
a
little
longer
do
y
yyou
nuhknow
where
wwwe
are
he
asked
eddie
eddie
pointed
down
the
slightly
crooked
bore
of
the
tunnel
canal
that
way
he
said
lessin
half
a
mile
unless
this
thing
turns
in
a
different
direction
we're
under
upmile
hill
right
now
i
think
but
bill
the
match
burned
bill
ringers
and
he
let
it
drop
they
were
in
darkness
again
someone
bill
thought
it
was
beverly
sighed
but
before
the
match
had
gone
out
he
had
seen
the
worry
on
eddie
face
w
w
what
what
ihis
it
when
i
say
we're
under
upmile
hill
i
mean
we're
really
under
it
we
been
going
down
for
a
long
time
now
nobody'd
ever
put
sewerpipe
in
this
deep
when
you
put
a
tunnel
this
deep
you
call
it
a
mine
shaft
how
deep
do
you
figure
we
are
eddie
richie
asked
quarter
of
a
mile
eddie
said
maybe
more
jesus
pleaseu
beverly
said
these
aren't
sewerpipes

stan
said
from
behind
them
you
can
tell
by
that
smell
it
bad
but
it
not
a
sewery
smell
i
think
i'd
rather
smell
the
sewe
ben
said
it
smells
like
a
scream
floated
down
to
them
issuing
from
the
mouth
of
the
pipe
they
had
just
left
lifting
the
hair
on
the
nape
of
bill
neck
the
seven
of
them
drew
together
clutching
each
other
gonna
get
you
sons
of
bitches

gonna
get

henr
eddie
breathed
oh

still
coming
tm
not
surprised
richie
said
some
people
are
too
stupid
to
quit
they
could
hear
faint
panting
the
scrape
of
shoes
the
whisper
of
cloth
youuuuuuuuu

o
bill
said
they
started
down
the
pipe
now
walking
double
except
for
mike
who
was
at
the
back
of
the
line
bill
and
eddie
richie

eddie
said
the
echoes

bad
he
dropped
his
voice
did

that
pile
of
bones
yyye
bill
said
dropping
his
own
voice
there
was
a
tool
belt

water
department
guy
i
guh
guess

how
long

i
dddon't

i
eddie
closed
his
good
hand
over
bill
arm
in
the
darkness
it
was
perhaps
fifteen
minutes
later
when
they
heard
something
coming
toward
them
in
the
dark
richie
stopped
frozen
cold
all
the
way
through
suddenly
he
was
three
years
old
again
he
listened
to
that
squelching
shifting
movement
closing
in
on
them
closing
and
to
the
whispering
branchlike
sounds
that
accompanied
it
and
even
before
bill
struck
a
match
he
knew
what
it
would
be
the
ey
he
screamed
christ
it
the
crawling
eye
for
a
moment
the
others
were
not
sure
what
they
were
seeing
beverly
had
an
impression
that
her
father
had
found
her
even
down
here
and
eddie
had
a
fleeting
vision
of
patrick
hockstetter
come
back
to
life
somehow
patrick
had
flanked
them
and
gotten
in
front
of
them
but
richie
cry
richie
certainty
froze
the
shape
for
all
of
them
they
saw
what
richie
saw
a
gigantic
eye
filled
the
tunnel
the
glassy
black
pupil
two
feet
across
the
iris
a
muddy
russet
color
the
white
was
bulgy
membranous
laced
with
red
veins
that
pulsed
steadily
it
was
a
lidless
lashless
gelatinous
horror
that
moved
on
a
bed
of
rawlooking
tentacles
these
fumbled
over
the
tunnel
crumbly
surface
and
sank
in
like
fingers
so
that
the
impression
given
in
the
glow
of
bill
guttering
match
was
of
an
eye
that
had
somehow
grown
nightmare
fingers
which
were
pulling
it
along
it
stared
at
them
with
blank
feverish
avarice
the
match
went
out
in
the
darkness
bill
felt
those
branchlike
tentacles
caress
his
ankles
his
shins
but
he
could
not
move
his
body
was
frozen
solid
he
sensed
it
approaching
he
could
feel
the
heat
radiating
out
from
it
and
could
hear
the
wet
pulse
of
blood
wetting
its
membranes
he
imagined
the
stickiness
he
would
feel
when
it
touched
him
and
still
he
could
not
scream
even
when
fresh
tentacles
slipped
around
his
waist
and
hooked
themselves
into
the
loops
of
his
jeans
and
began
to
drag
him
forward
he
could
not
scream
or
struggle
a
deadly
sleepiness
seemed
to
have
suffused
his
whole
body
beverly
felt
one
of
the
tentacles
slip
around
the
cup
of
her
ear
and
suddenly
draw
noose
tight
paul
flared
and
she
was
dragged
forward
twisting
and
moaning
as
if
an
oldlady
schoolteacher
were
giving
her
an
outofpatience
comealong
to
the
back
of
the
room
where
she
would
be
forced
to
sit
on
a
stool
and
wear
a
duncecap
stan
and
richie
tried
to
back
away
but
a
forest
of
unseen
tentacles
now
wavered
and
whispered
about
them
ben
put
an
arm
around
beverly
and
tried
to
tug
her
back
she
clasped
his
hands
with
panicky
tightness
ben
ben
it
got
me
no
it
don't
wait
ti
pull
he
pulled
with
all
his
might
and
beverly
screamed
as
pain
tore
through
her
ear
and
blood
began
to
flow
a
tentacle
dry
and
hard
scraped
over
ben
shirt
paused
then
twisted
in
a
painful
knot
around
his
shoulder
bill
put
out
a
hand
and
it
slapped
into
a
gluey
yielding
wetness
the
eye
his
mind
screamed
oh
god
i
got
my
hand
in
the
eye
oh
god
oh
dear
sweet
god
the
eye
my
hand
in
the
eye
he
began
to
fight
now
but
the
tentacles
drew
him
forward
inexorably
his
hand
disappeared
into
that
wet
avid
heat
his
forearm
now
his
arm
was
lunged
into
the
eye
up
to
the
elbow
at
any
moment
the
rest
of
his
body
would
come
against
that
sticky
surface
and
he
felt
that
he
would
go
mad
in
that
instant
he
fought
frantically
chopping
at
the
tentacles
with
his
other
hand
eddie
stood
like
a
boy
in
a
dream
hearing
the
muffled
screams
and
sounds
of
struggle
as
his
friends
were
being
pulled
in
he
sensed
the
tentacles
around
him
but
none
had
as
yet
actually
landed
on
him
run
home
his
mind
commanded
him
quite
loudly
run
home
to
your
mamma
eddie
you
can
find
the
way
bill
screamed
in
the
dark
a
high
despairing
sound
that
was
followed
by
hideous
squishings
and
slobberings
eddie
paralysis
broke
wide
open
it
was
trying
to
take
big
bill
no
eddie
bellowed
it
was
a
fullblown
roar
one
might
never
have
guessed
such
a
norsewarrior
sound
could
issue
from
such
a
thin
chest
eddie
kaspbrak
chest
eddie
kaspbrak
jungs
which
were
of
course
afflicted
with
the
most
terrible
case
of
asthma
in
derry
he
bolted
forward
jumping
over
questing
tentacles
without
seeing
them
his
broken
arm
thumping
his
own
chest
as
it
swung
back
and
forth
in
its
soggy
cast
he
fumbled
in
his
pocket
and
brought
out
his
aspirator
acid
that
what
it
tastes
like
acid
acid
battery
acid
he
collided
with
bill
denbrough
back
and
slammed
him
aside
there
was
a
watery
ripping
sound
followed
by
a
low
eager
mewling
that
eddie
did
not
so
much
hear
with
his
ears
as
feel
with
his
mind
he
raised
the
aspirator
acid
it
acid
if
i
want
it
to
be
so
eat
it
eat
it
eat
battery
acid
fucknut
eddie
screamed
and
triggered
off
a
blast
at
the
same
time
he
kicked
at
the
eye
his
foot
went
deep
into
the
jelly
of
its
cornea
there
was
a
gush
of
hot
fluid
over
his
leg
he
pulled
his
foot
back
only
dimly
aware
that
he
had
lost
his
shoe
fuck
off
cram
it
sam
go
away
jose
get
lost
fuck
off
he
felt
tentacles
touch
him
but
tentatively
he
triggered
the
aspirator
again
coating
the
eye
and
felt/heard
that
mewling
again
now
a
hurt
surprised
sound
fight
it
eddie
raved
at
the
others
it
just
a
fucking
eye
fight
it
you
hear
me

it
bill
kick
the
shit
out
of
the
sucker
jesus

i'm
doing
the
mashed
potatoes
all
over
it
and
i
got
a
broken
ar
bill
felt
his
strength
retum
he
ripped
his
dripping
arm
out
of
the
eye
and
then
slammed
it
fistfirst
back
in
a
moment
later
ben
was
beside
him
he
ran
into
the
eye
grunted
with
surprise
and
disgust
and
then
began
to
rain
punches
onto
its
jellied
quivering
surface
let
her
go
he
yelled
you
hear
me
let
her
go
get
outta
here
get
outta
her
just
an
eye
just
a
fucking
ey
eddie
was
screaming
deliriously
he
triggered
his
aspirator
again
and
felt
it
draw
back
the
tentacles
which
had
settled
on
him
now
dropped
away
richie
richie
get
it
it
just
an
ey
richie
stumbled
forward
unable
to
believe
he
was
doing
this
actually
approaching
the
worst
most
terrible
monster
in
the
world
but
he
was
he
only
threw
a
single
weak
punch
and
the
feel
of
hs
fist
sinking
into
the
eye
it
was
thick
and
wet
and
somehow
gristly
made
him
throw
his
guts
up
in
one
big
tasteless
convulsion
a
sound
came
out
of
him
glurt
and
the
thought
that
he'd
actually
puked
on
the
eye
caused
him
to
do
it
again
it
was
mly
a
single
punch
but
since
he
had
created
this
particular
monster
perhaps
that
was
all
that
was
necessary
suddenly
the
tentacles
were
gone
they
could
hear
it
withdrawing
and
then
the
only
sounds
were
eddie
panting
and
beverly
crying
softly
one
hand
to
her
bleeding
ear
bill
struck
one
of
their
three
remaining
matches
and
they
stared
at
each
other
with
dazed
shocked
faces
bill
left
arm
was
running
with
a
thick
cloudy
goo
that
looked
like
a
mixture
of
partially
congealed
eggwhite
and
snot
blood
was
trickling
slowly
down
the
side
of
beverly
neck
and
there
was
a
fresh
cut
on
ben
cheek
richie
slowly
pushed
his
glasses
up
on
his
nose
aaare
we
all
ruhruhright
bill
asked
hoarsely

bill
richie
asked

turned
to

hugged

smaller
boy
with
fierce
intensity

and
uttered
a

laugh

new

of
keds
when

clapped
eddie
on
the
back
in
the
dark
how
did

eddie
shot
it
with
my
aspirator

that
how
it
tastes
after

tightly
but

began
to
shriek
with
laughter
that
the
shittiest
voice
i
ever
heard
richie
well

that
aspirator
thing
handy
beverly
said

mike
asked
when

lit
the
match

said
and
then
added
grimly
but

stuhstuhstays
and

ththat
time
henry
still
coming
stan
said
his
voice
was
low
and
hoarse
i
can
hear
him
back
there
then
let
move
out
ben
said
they
did
the
tunnel
progressed
steadily
downward
and
that
smell
that
low
wild
stench
grew
steadily
stronger
at
times
they
could
hear
henry
behind
them
but
now
his
cries
seemed
far
away
and
not
at
all
important
there
was
a
feeling
in
all
of
them
similar
to
that
feeling
of
skew
and
disconnection
they
had
felt
in
the
house
on
neibolt
street
that
they
had
progressed
over
the
edge
of
the
world
and
into
some
queer
nothingness
bill
felt
although
he
did
not
have
the
vocabulary
to
express
what
he
knew
that
they
were
approaching
derry
dark
and
ruined
heart
it
seemed
to
mike
hanlon
that
he
could
almost
feel
that
heart
diseased
arrhythmic
beat
beverly
felt
a
sense
of
evil
power
growing
around
her
seeming
to
enfold
her
certainly
trying
to
split
her
off
from
the
dhers
and
make
her
alone
nervously
she
reached
out
on
either
side
of
herself
and
clasped
bill
hand
and
ben
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
to
reach
too
far
and
she
called
out
nervously
hang
onto
hands
it
like
we're
moving
away
from
each
other
it
was
stan
who
first
realized
he
could
see
again
there
was
a
low
strange
radiance
in
the
air
at
first
he
could
only
see
hands
his
clasping
ben
on
one
side
and
mike
on
the
other
then
he
realized
he
could
see
the
buttons
on
richie
muddy
shirt
and
the
captain
midnight
ring
just
some
junky
cereal
box
prize
that
eddie
liked
to
wear
on
his
little
finger
can
you
guys
see
stan
asked
coming
to
a
stop
the
others
stopped
too
bill
looked
around
first
aware
that
he
could
see
a
little
anyway
and
then
that
the
tunnel
had
widened
out
amazingly
they
were
now
in
a
curved
chamber
easily
as
big
as
the
sunnier
tunnel
in
boston
bigger
he
amended
as
he
looked
around
with
a
growing
sense
of
awe
they
craned
their
necks
back
to
see
the
ceiling
which
was
now
fifty
feet
or
more
above
them
and
held
up
by
outcurving
buttresses
of
stone
like
ribs
nets
of
dirty
cobweb
hung
between
them
the
floor
was
now
stoneflagged
but
overlaid
with
such
a
drift
of
ancient
dirt
that
the
quality
of
their
footfalls
had
never
changed
the
upcurving
walls
were
easily
fifty
feet
away
on
either
side
waterworks
must
have
really
gone
crazy
down
here
richie
said
and
laughed
uneasily
looks
like
a
cathedral
beverly
said
softly
where
the
light
coming
from
ben
wanted
to
know
coming
rright
out
of
the
wwwalls
looks
llik
bill
said
don't
like
it
stan
said
let
guh
go
henry'll
be
breathing
dddown
our
nuh
necks
a
loud
braying
cry
split
the
gloom
and
then
the
ruffling
heavy
thunder
of
wings
a
shape
came
cruising
out
of
the
dark
one
eye
glaring
the
other
was
a
dark
lamp
the
bird
stan
screamed
look
out
it
the
bird
it
dived
at
them
like
an
obscene
fighterplane
its
plated
orange
beak
opening
and
closing
to
reveal
the
pink
inner
lining
of
its
mouth
plush
as
a
satin
pillow
in
a
coffin
it
went
straight
for
eddie
its
beak
raked
his
shoulder
and
he
felt
pain
sink
into
his
flesh
like
acid
blood
flowed
down
his
chest
he
cried
out
as
the
backwash
of
its
beating
wings
blew
noxious
tunnel
air
in
his
face
it
wheeled
back
its
eye
glaring
malevolently
rolling
in
its
socket
blurring
only
as
its
nictitating
eyelid
jittered
down
momentarily
to
cover
the
eye
with
tissuethin
film
its
claws
sought
eddie
who
ducked
screaming
they
razored
through
the
back
of
his
shirt
cutting
it
open
drawing
shallow
scarlet
lines
along
his
shoulderblades
eddie
yelled
and
tried
to
crawl
away
but
the
bird
wheeled
back
again
mike
broke
forward
digging
in
his
pocket
he
came
out
with
a
oneblade
buck
knife
as
the
bird
dived
on
eddie
again
he
swept
it
in
a
quick
tight
arc
across
one
of
the
bird
talons
it
cut
deep
and
blood
poured
out
the
bird
banked
away
and
then
came
back
folding
its
wings
diving
in
like
a
bullet
mike
fell
to
one
side
at
the
last
moment
slashing
upward
with
the
buck
knife
he
missed
and
the
bird
claw
hit
his
wrist
with
such
force
that
his
hand
went
numb
and
tingly
the
bruise
that
later
bloomed
there
went
most
of
the
way
to
his
elbow
the
buck
flew
into
the
dark
the
bird
came
back
screeching
triumphantly
and
mike
rolled
his
body
over
eddie
and
waited
for
the
worst
stan
walked
forward
toward
the
two
boys
huddled
on
the
floor
as
the
bird
returned
he
stood
small
and
somehow
trim
in
spite
of
the
dirt
grimed
into
his
hands
and
arms
and
pants
and
shirt
and
suddenly
held
his
hands
out
in
a
curious
gesture
palms
up
fingers
down
the
bird
uttered
another
squawk
and
sheared
off
bulleting
by
stan
missing
him
by
inches
lifting
his
hair
and
then
dropping
it
in
the
buffeting
wake
of
its
passage
he
turned
in
a
tight
circle
to
face
its
return
i
believe
in
scarlet
tanagers
even
though
i
never
saw
one
he
said
in
a
high
clear
voice
the
bird
screamed
and
banked
away
as
if
he'd
shot
at
it
same
with
vultures
and
the
new
guinea
mudlark
and
the
flamingos
of
brazil
the
bird
screamed
circled
and
suddenly
flew
on
up
the
tunnel
squawking
believe
in
the
golden
bald
eagle
stan
screamed
after
it
and
i
think
there
really
might
be
a
phoenix
somewhere
but
i
don't
believe
in
you
so
get
the
fuck
out
of
here
get
out
hit
the
road
jac
he
stopped
then
and
the
silence
seemed
very
large
bill
ben
and
beverly
went
to
mike
and
eddie
they
helped
eddie
to
his
feet
and
bill
looked
at
the
cuts

dddee
he
said
but
i
bbet
they
hurt
like
hhhell
tt
tore
my
shirt
to
pieces
big
bill
eddie
cheeks
glistened
with
tears
and
he
was
wheezing
again
the
bellowing
barbarian
vore

gone
it
was
hard
to
believe
it
had
ever

screamed
from
behind
them
his
voice
was
utterly
demented
he
was
laughing
and
howling

he
sounded
like
something
that
has
crawled
out
of
a
crack
in
the
roof
of

out
hh
henry
wwwhile
there
still
tuhtuhtim
henry
response
was
a
hollow
inarticulate
scream
they
heard
a
hustle
of
footsteps
and
in
a
burst
of
comprehension
bill
understood
henry
whole
purpose
he
was
real
he
was
mortal
he
could
not
be
stopped
by
an
aspirator
or
a
birdbook
magic
would
not
work
on
henry
he
was
too
stupid
cccome
ohon
we
guh
gotta
stay
aaahead
of
hhim
they
went
on
again
holding
hands
eddie
tattered
shirt
flapping
behind
him
the
light
grew
brighter
the
tunnel
ever
huger
as
it
canted
downward
the
ceiling
flew
away
above
until
they
could
barely
see
it
it
now
seemed
to
them
that
they
were
not
walking
in
a
tunnel
at
all
but
making
their
way
through
a
titanic
underground
courtyard
the
approach
to
some
cyclopean
castle
the
light
from
the
walls
had
become
a
running
greenyellow
fire
the
smell
was
stronger
and
they
began
to
pick
up
a
vibration
that
might
have
been
real
or
might
have
been
only
in
their
minds
it
was
steady
and
rhythmic
it
was
a
heartbeat
tt
ends
up
ahead
beverly
cried
look
it
a
blank
wall
but
as
they
drew
closer
antlike
now
on
this
great
floor
of
dirty
stone
blocks
each
block
bigger
than
bassey
park
it
seemed
they
saw
that
the
wall
was
not
entirely
blank
after
all
it
was
broken
by
a
single
door
and
although
the
wall
itself
towered
hundreds
of
feet
above
them
the
door
was
very
small
it
was
no
more
than
three
feet
high
a
door
of
the
sort
you
might
see
in
a
fairytale
book
made
of
stout
oaken
wards
bound
with
iron
strips
in
an
x
pattern
it
was
they
all
realized
at
once
a
door
made
only
for
children
ghostly
in
his
mind
ben
heard
the
librarian
reading
to
the
little
ones
who
is
that
trip
trapping
upon
my
bridge
the
children
lean
forward
all
the
old
fascination
glistening
in
their
eyes
will
the
monster
be
bested
or
will
it
feed
there
was
a
mark
on
the
door
and
heaped
at
its
foot
was
a
pile
of
bones
small
bones
the
bones
of
god
alone
knew
how
many
children
they
had
come
to
the
place
of
it
the
mark
on
the
door
then
what
was
that
bill
marked
it
as
a
paper
boat
stan
saw
it
as
a
bird
rising
toward
the
sky
a
phoenix
perhaps
michael
saw
a
hooded
face
that
of
crazy
butch
bowers
perhaps
if
it
could
only
be
seen
richie
saw
two
eyes
behind
a
pair
of
spectacles
beverly
saw
a
hand
doubled
up
into
a
fist
eddie
believed
it
to
be
the
face
of
the
leper
all
sunken
eyes
and
wrinkled
snarling
mouth
all
disease
all
sickness
was
stamped
into
that
face
ben
hanscom
saw
a
tattered
pile
of
wrappings
and
seemed
to
smell
old
sour
spices
later
arriving
at
that
same
door
with
belch
screams
still
echoing
in
his
ears
alone
at
the
end
of
it
henry
bowers
would
see
it
as
the
moon
full
ripe
and
black
tm
scared
bill
ben
said
in
a
wavering
voice
do
we
have
to
bill
toed
the
bones
and
suddenly
scattered
them
in
a
powdery
raiding
drift
with
one
foot
he
was
scared
too
but
there
was
george
to
consider
it
had
ripped
off
george
arm
were
those
small
and
fragile
bones
among
these
yes
of
course
they
were
they
were
here
for
the
owners
of
the
bones
george
and
all
the
others
those
who
had
been
brought
here
those
who
might
be
brought
here
those
who
lad
been
left
in
other
places
simply
to
rot
we
have
bill
said
what
if

locked
beverly
asked
in
a
small
voice
ibits

said
and
then
told
her
what
he
knew
from
deeper
inside
pluh

he
placed
the
tented
fingers
of
his
right
hand
on
the
door
and
pushed
it
swung
open
on
a
flood
of
sick
yellowgreen
light
that
zoo
smell
wafted
out
at
them
incredibly
strong
incredibly
potent
now
one
by
one
they
passed
through
the
fairytale
door
and
into
the
lair
of
it
bill
in
the
tunnels
/
a
m
stopped
so
suddenly
that
the

piled
up
like

said
he
struck
a
light
and
looked
around
at
the
others
their
faces
were
luminous
in
the
glow
of
the
match
luminous
and
mystic
and
they
seemed
very
young
how
you

eddie
said
but
his
face
was
drawn
with
pain
bill
makeshift
splint

coming
apart
how

bill
said
and
shook
out
the
match
before
his
face
could
tell
them
any
different
story
how
did
it
happen
beverly

tom
beverly
said
in
a
low
almost
musing
voice
wwwho
bill
struck
another
match
she
was
looking
at
him
with
a
kind
of
desperate
honesty
tom
my
husband
he
knew
too
at
least
i
think
i
mentioned
the
name
of
the
town
to
him
the
way
you
mentioned
it
to
audra
i
i
don't
know
if
it
took
or
not
he
was
pretty
angry
with
me
at
the
time
jesus
what
is
this
some
kind
of
soap
opera
where
everybody
turns
up
sooner
or
later
richie
said
not
a
soap
opera
bill
said
sounding
sick
a
show
like
the
circus
bev
here
went
and
married
henry
bowers
when
she
left
why
wouldn't
he
come
here
after
all
the
real
henry
did
n
beverly
said
i

henry
i
married
my
father
if

beat
on
you
what
the
difference
eddie
asked
cc
come
around
me
bill
said
muhmuhmove
in
they
did
bill
reached
out
to
either
side
and
found
eddie
good
hand
and
one
of
richie
hands
soon
they
stood
in
a
circle
as
they
had
done
once
before
when
their
number
was
greater
eddie
felt
someone
put
an
arm
around
his
shoulders
the
feeling
was
warm
and
comforting
and
deeply
familiar
bill
felt
the
sense
of
power
that
he
remembered
from
before
but
understood
with
some
desperation
that
things
really
had
changed
the
power
was
nowhere
near
as
strong
it
struggled
and
flickered
like
a
candleflame
in
foul
air
the
darkness
seemed
thicker
and
closer
to
them
more
triumphant
and
he
could
smell
it
down
this
passageway
he
thought
and
not
so
terribly
far
is
a
door
with
a
mark
on
it
what
was
behind
that
door
it
the
one
thing
i
still
can't
remember
i
can
remember
making
my
fingers
stiff
because
they
wanted
to
tremble
and
i
can
remember
pushing
the
door
open
i
can
even
remember
the
flood
of
light
that
streamed
out
and
how
it
seemed
almost
alive
as
if
it
wasn't
just
light
but
fluorescent
snakes
i
remember
the
smell
like
the
monkeyhouse
in
a
big
zoo
but
even
worse
and
then
nothing

aaany
of

y
yyou

eddie

almost
feel

shake
his
head
in
the
dark

beverly

bill
ben
said
his
voice
was
very
calm
something
is
coming
bill
listened
he
heard
dragging
shambling
footsteps
approaching
them
in
the
dark
and
he
was
afraid
aaaudr
he
called
and
knew
already
that
it
was
not
her
whatever
was
shambling
toward
them
drew
closer
bill
struck
a
light
derry
/
a.m
the
first
wrong
thing
happened
on
that
latespring
day
in
two
minutes
before
official
sunrise
to
understand
how
wrong
it
was
one
would
have
to
have
known
two
facts
that
were
known
to
mike
hanlon
who
lay
unconscious
in
the
derry
home
hospital
as
the
sun
came
up
both
concerning
the
grace
baptist
church
which
had
stood
on
the
corner
of
witcham
and
jackson
since
the
church
was
topped
with
a
slender
white
spire
which
was
the
apotheosis
of
every
protestant
churchsteeple
in
new
england
there
were
clockfaces
on
all
four
sides
of
the
steeplebase
and
the
clock
itself
had
been
constructed
and
shipped
from
switzerland
in
the
year
the
only
one
like
it
stood
in
the
town
square
of
haven
village
forty
miles
away
stephen
bowe
a
timber
baron
who
lived
on
west
broadway
donated
the
clock
to
the
town
at
a
cost
of
some
$
bowie
could
afford
it
he
was
a
devout
churchgoer
and
deacon
for
forty
years
during
several
of
those
later
years
he
was
also
president
of
derry
legion
of
white
decency
chapter
in
addition
he
was
known
for
his
devout
layman
sermons
on
mother
day
which
he
always
referred
to
reverently
as
mother
sunday
from
the
time
of
its
installation
until
may
st
that
clock
had
faithfully
chimed
each
hour
and
each
half
with
one
notable
exception
on
the
day
of
the
explosion
at
the
kitchener
ironworks
it
had
not
chimed
the
noorhour
residents
believed
that
the
reverend
jollyn
had
silenced
the
clock
to
show
that
the
church
was
in
mouming
for
the
dead
children
and
jollyn
never
disabused
them
of
this
notion
although
it
was
not
true
the
clock
had
simply
not
chimed
nor
did
it
chime
the
hour
of
five
on
the
morning
of
may
st
at
that
moment
all
over
derry
oldtimers
opened
their
eyes
and
sat
up
disturbed
for
no
reason
they
could
put
their
fingers
on
medicines
were
gulped
false
teeth
put
in
pipes
and
cigars
lit
the
old
folks
stood
a
watch
one
of
them
was
norbert
keene
now
in
his
nineties
he
hobbled
to
the
window
and
looked
out
at
a
darkening
sky
the
weather
report
the
night
before
had
called
for
clear
skies
but
his
bones
told
him
it
was
going
to
rain
and
hard
he
felt
scared
deep
inside
him
in
some
obscure
way
he
felt
threatened
as
if
a
poison
were
working
its
way
relentlessly
toward
his
heart
he
thought
randomly
of
the
day
the
bradley
gang
had
ridden
heedlessly
into
derry
into
the
sights
of
seventyfive
pistols
and
rifles
that
kind
of
work
left
a
man
feeling
kind
of
warm
and
lazy
inside
like
everything
was
was
somehow
confirmed
he
couldn't
put
it
any
better
than
that
even
to
himself
work
like
that
left
a
man
feeling
like
he
maybe
might
live
forever
and
norbert
keene
damn
near
had
ninetysix
years
old
come
june
th
and
he
still
walked
three
miles
every
day
but
now
he
felt
scared
those
kids
he
said
looking
out
his
window
unaware
he
had
spoken
what
is
it
with
them
damn
kids
what
they
monkeying
around
with
this
time
egbert
thoroughgood
ninetynine
who
had
been
in
the
silver
dollar
when
claude
heroux
tuned
up
his
axe
and
played
the
dead
march
for
four
men
on
it
awoke
at
the
same
moment
sat
up
and
let
out
a
rusty
scream
that
no
one
heard
he
had
dreamed
of
claude
only
claude
had
been
coming
after
him
and
the
axe
had
come
down
ad
a
moment
after
it
did
thoroughgood
had
seen
his
own
severed
hand
twitching
and
curling
on
the
counter
something
wrong
he
thought
in
his
muddy
way
frightened
and
shaking
all
over
in
his
pee
stained
longjohns
something
dreadful
wrong
dave
gardener
who
had
discovered
george
denbrough
mutilated
body
in
october
of
and
whose
son
had
discovered
the
first
victim
of
this
new
cycle
earlier
in
the
spring
opened
his
eyes
on
the
stroke
of
five
and
thought
even
before
looking
at
the
clock
on
the
bureau
grace
church
clock
didn't
chime
the
hour
what
wrong
he
felt
a
large
ill
defined
fright
dave
had
prospered
over
the
years
in
he
had
purchased
the
shoeboat
and
now
there
was
a
second
shoeboat
at
the
derry
mall
and
a
third
up
in
bangor
suddenly
all
of
those
things
things
he
had
spent
his
life
working
for
seemed
in
jeopardy
from
what
he
cried
to
himself
looking
at
his
sleeping
wife
from
what
why
you
so
goddam
antsy
just
because
that
clock
didn't
chime
but
there
was
no
answer
he
got
up
and
went
to
the
window
hitching
at
the
waistband
of
his
pyjamas
the
sky
was
restless
with
clouds
racing
in
from
the
west
and
dave
disquiet
grew
for
the
first
time
in
a
very
long
while
he
found
himself
thinking
of
the
screams
that
had
brought
him
to
his
porch
twentyseven
years
ago
to
see
that
writhing
figure
in
the
yellow
rainslicker
he
looked
at
the
approaching
clouds
and
thought
we're
in
danger
all
of
its
derry
chief
andrew
rademacher
who
really
believed
he
had
tried
his
best
to
solve
the
new
string
of
childmurders
that
had
plagued
derry
stood
on
the
porch
of
his
house
thumbs
in
his
sam
browne
belt
looking
up
at
the
clouds
and
felt
the
same
disquiet
something
getting
ready
to
happen
looks
like
it
going
to
pour
buckets
for
one
thing
but
that
not
all
he
shuddered
and
as
he
stood
there
on
his
porch
the
smell
of
the
bacon
his
wife
was
cooking
wafting
out
through
the
screen
door
the
first
dimesized
drops
of
rain
darkened
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
his
pleasant
reynolds
street
home
and
somewhere
just
over
the
horizon
from
bassey
park
thunder
rumbled
rademacher
shivered
again
george
/
a.m
bill
held
the
match
up
and
uttered
a
long
trembling
despairing
screech
it
was
george
wavering
up
the
tunnel
toward
him
george
still
dressed
in
his
blood
spattered

one
sleeve
dangled
limp
and
useless
george

was
white
as

his

fixed
on

now
his

arm
rose
toward

at

hooked
into
a
claw
the

were
dirty

grasping

a
kind
of
laughter
bill
could
smell
him
now
could
smell
george
rotting
it
was
a
cellarsmell
squirmy
the
smell
of
some
final
monster
standing
slumped
and
yellow
eyed
in
the
comer
waiting
to
unzip
some
small
boy
guts
george
teeth
gnashed
together
the
sound
was
like
billiard
balls
clicking
off
one
another
yellow
pus
began
to
leak
from
his
eyes
and
dribble
down
his
face
and
the
match
went
out
bill
felt
his
friends
disappear
they
vere
running
of
course
they
were
they
were
leaving
him
alone
they
were
cutting
him
off
as
his
parents
had
cut
him
off
because
george
was
right
it
was
all
his
fault
soon
he
would
feel
that
single
hand
seize
his
throat
soon
he
would
feel
those
fangs
pulling
him
open
and
that
would
be
right
that
would
be
only
just
he
had
sent
george
out
to
die
and
he
had
spent
his
whole
adult
life
writing
about
the
horror
of
that
betrayal
oh
he
had
put
many
faces
on
it
almost
as
many
faces
as
it
had
put
on
for
their
benefit
but
the
monster
at
the
bottom
of
everything
was
only
george
running
out
into
the
receding
flood
with
his
paraffin
coated
paper
boat
now
would
come
the
atonement
you
deserve
to
die
for
killing
me
george
whispered
he
was
very
close
now
bill
closed
his
eyes
then
yellow
light
splashed
the
tunnel
and
he
opened
them
richie
was
holding
up
a
match
fight
it
bill
richie
shouted
god
sake
fight
it
what
are
you
doing
here
he
looked
at
them
bewildered
they
hadn't
run
after
all
how
could
that
be
how
could
that
be
after
they
had
seen
how
foully
he
had
murdered
his
own
brother
fight
it
beverly
was
screaming
oh
bill
fight
it
only
you
can
do
this
one
please
george
was
less
than
five
feet
away
now
he
suddenly
stuck
his
tongue
out
at
bill
it
was
crawling
with
white
fungoid
growths
bill
screamed
again
kill
it
bill
eddie
shouted
that
not
your
brother
kill
it
while
it
small
kill
it
now
george
glanced
at
eddie
cutting
his
shinysilver
eyes
that
way
for
just
a
moment
and
eddie
reeled
back
and
struck
the
wall
as
if
he
had
been
pushed
bill
stood
mesmerized
watching
his
brother
come
toward
him
george
again
after
all
these
years
it
was
george
at
the
end
as
it
had
been
george
at
the
beginning
oh
yes
and
he
could
hear
the
creak
of
george
yellow
slicker
as
george
closed
the
distance
he
could
hear
the
jingle
of
the
buckles
on
his
overshoes
and
he
could
smell
something
like
wet
leaves
as
if
underneath
the
slicker
george
body
was
made
df
them
as
if
the
feet
inside
george
galoshes
were
leaffeet
yes
a
leafman
that
was
it
that
was
george
he
was
a
rotted
balloon
face
and
a
body
made
of
dead
leaves
the
kind
that
sometimes
choke
the
sewers
after
a
flood
dimly
he
heard
beverly
shriek
he
thrusts
his
fists
bill
please
bill
against
the
posts
and
still
insists
we'll
look
for
my
boat
together
george
said
thick
yellow
pus
mock
tears
rolled
down
his
cheeks
he
reached
for
bill
and
his
head
cocked
sideward
his
teeth
peeling
back
from
those
fangs
he
sees
the
ghosts
he
sees
the
ghosts
he
sees
we'll
find
it
george
said
and
bill
could
smell
its
breath
and
it
was
a
smell
like
exploded
animals
lying
on
the
highway
at
midnight
as
george
mouth
yawned
he
could
see
things
squirming
around
inside
there
it
still
down
here
everything
floats
down
here
we'll
float
bill
we'll
all
float
george
fishbelly
hand
closed
on
bill
neck
he
sees
the
ghosts
we
see
the
ghosts
they
we
you
see
the
ghosts

george
contorted
face
drifted
toward
bill
neck
float
he
thrusts
his
fists
against
the
posts
bill
cried
his
voice
was
deeper
hardly
his
own
at
all
and
in
a
searing
flash
of
memory
richie
remembered
that
bill
only
stuttered
in
his
own
voice
when
he
pretended
to
be
someone
else
he
never
did
the
georgething
recoiled
hissing
its
hand
going
to
its
face
in
a
warding
off
gesture
that
it
richie
screamed
deliriously
you
got
it
bill
get
it
get
it
get
i
he
thrusts
his
fists
against
the
posts
and
still
insists
he
sees
the
ghosts
bill
thundered
he
advanced
on
the
georgething
you're
no
ghost
george
knows
i
didn't
mean
for
him
to
die
my
folks
were
wrong
they
took
it
out
on
me
and
that
was
wrong
do
you
hear
m
the
georgething
abruptly
turned
squealing
like
a
rat
it
began
to
run
and
ripple
under
the
yellow
slicker
the
slicker
itself
seemed
to
be
dripping
running
in
bright
blots
of
yellow
it
was
losing
its
shape
becoming
amorphous
he
thrusts
his
fists
against
the
posts
you
son
of
a
bitch
bill
denbrough
screamed
and
still
insists
he
sees
the
ghosts
he
leaped
at
it
and
his
fingers
snagged
in
the
yellow
rainslicker
that
was
no
longer
a
rainslicker
what
he
grabbed
felt
like
some
strange
warm
taffy
that
melted
under
his
fingers
as
soon
as
he
had
closed
his
fist
around
it
he
fell
to
his
knees
then
richie
yelled
as
the
guttering
match
burned
his
fingers
and
they
were
plunged
into
darkness
again
bill
felt
something
begin
to
grow
in
his
chest
something
hot
and
choking
and
as
painful
as
fiery
nettles
he
gripped
his
knees
and
drew
them
up
to
his
chin
hoping
it
would
stop
the
pain
or
perhaps
ease
it
he
was
dimly
thankful
for
the
dark
glad
that
the
others
couldn't
see
this
agony
he
heard
a
sound
escape
him
a
wavering
moan
there
was
a
second
a
third
george
he
cried
george
i'm
sorry
i
never
meant
for
anything
bbbbad
to
huhhuhhappe
perhaps
there
was
something
else
to
say
but
he
could
not
say
it
he
was
sobbing
then
lying
on
his
back
with
one
arm
over
his
eyes
remembering
the
boat
remembering
the
steady
beat
of
the
rain
against
his
bedroom
windows
remembering
the
medicines
and
the
tissues
on
the
nighttable
the
faint
ache
of
fever
in
his
head
and
in
his
body
remembering
george
most
of
all
that
remembering
george
george
in
his
yellow
hooded
slicker
george
i'm
sorry
he
cried
through
his
tears
t'm
sorry
i'm
sorry
please
i'm
suhsuh
sorry
and
then
they
were
around
him
his
friends
and
no
one
lit
a
match
and
someone
held
him
he
didn't
know
who
beverly
maybe
or
maybe
ben
or
richie
they
were
with
him
and
for
that
little
while
the
darkness
was
kind
derry
/
a.m
by
it
was
raining
hard
the
weather
forecasters
on
the
bangor
radio
stations
expressed
mild
surprise
and
tendered
mild
apologies
to
all
the
people
who
had
made
plans
for
picnics
and
outings
on
the
basis
of
yesterday
forecasts
tough
break
folks
just
one
of
those
odd
weather
patterns
that
sometimes
developed
in
the
penobscot
valley
with
startling
suddenness
on
wzon
meteorologist
jim
witt
described
what
he
called
an
extraordnarily
disciplined
lowpressure
system
that
was
putting
it
mildly
conditions
went
from
cloudy
in
bangor
to
showery
in
hampden
to
drizzly
in
haven
to
moderate
rain
in
newport
but
in
derry
only
thirty
miles
from
downtown
bangor
it
was
pouring
travellers
on
route
found
themselves
moving
through
water
that
was
eight
inches
deep
in
places
and
beyond
the
rhulin
farms
a
plugged
culvert
in
a
dip
had
covered
the
highway
with
so
much
water
that
the
highway
was
actually
impassable
by
six
that
morning
the
derry
highway
patrol
had
orange
detour
signs
on
both
sides
of
the
dip
those
who
waited
under
the
shelter
on
main
street
for
the
first
bus
of
the
day
to
take
them
to
work
stood
looking
over
the
railing
at
the
canal
where
the
water
was
ominously
high
in
its
concrete
channel
there
would
be
no
flood
of
course
all
agreed
on
that
the
water
was
still
four
feet
telow
the
highwater
mark
of
and
there
had
been
no
flood
that
year
but
the
rain
came
down
with
steady
pounding
persistence
and
thunder
grumbled
in
the
low
clouds
water
ran
down
upmile
hill
in
streams
and
roared
in
the
stormdrains
and
sewers
no
flood
they
agreed
but
there
was
a
patina
of
unease
on
every
face
at
a
powertransformer
on
a
pole
beside
the
abandoned
tracker
brother
truck
depot
exploded
in
a
flash
of
purple
light
spraying
twisted
chunks
of
metal
onto
the
shingled
roof
one
of
the
flying
chunks
of
metal
severed
a
hightension
wire
which
also
fell
on
the
roof
spluttering
and
twisting
like
a
snake
shooting
an
almost
liquid
stream
of
sparks
the
roof
caught
fire
in
spite
of
the
downpour
and
soon
the
depot
was
blazing
the
powercable
tumbled
from
the
roof
to
the
weedy
verge
that
led
around
to
the
lot
where
small
boys
had
once
played
baseball
the
derry
fire
department
rolled
for
the
first
time
that
day
at
a.m
and
arrived
at
tracker
brothers
at
one
of
the
first
firemen
off
the
truck
was
calvin
clark
one
of
the
clark
twins
with
whom
ben
beverly
richie
and
bill
had
gone
to
school
his
third
step
away
from
the
truck
brought
the
sole
of
his
leather
boot
down
on
the
live
line
calvin
was
electrocuted
almost
instantly
his
tongue
popped
out
of
his
mouth
and
his
rubber
fireman
coat
began
to
smolder
he
smelled
like
burning
tires
at
the
town
dump
at
a.m
residents
of
merit
street
in
the
old
cape
felt
something
that
might
have
been
an
underground
explosion
plates
fell
from
shelves
and
pictures
from
walls
at
every
toilet
on
merit
street
suddenly
exploded
in
a
geyser
of
shit
and
raw
sewage
as
some
unimaginable
reversal
took
place
in
the
pipes
which
fed
the
holding
tanks
of
the
new
waste
treatment
plant
in
the
barrens
in
some
cases
these
explosions
were
strong
enough
to
tear
holes
in
bathroom
ceilings
a
woman
named
anne
stuart
was
killed
when
an
ancient
gear
wheel
catapulted
from
her
toilet
along
with
a
gout
of
sewage
the
gearwheel
went
through
the
frosted
glass
of
the
shower
door
and
passed
through
her
throat
like
a
terrible
bullet
as
she
washed
her
hair
she
was
nearly
decapitated
the
gearwheel
was
a
relic
of
the
kitchener
ironworks
and
had
found
its
way
into
the
sewers
almost
threequarters
of
a
century
before
another
woman
was
killed
when
the
sudden
violent
reversal
of
sewage
driven
by
expanding
methane
gases
caused
her
toilet
to
explode
like
a
bomb
the
unfortunate
woman
who
was
sitting
on
the
john
at
the
time
and
reading
the
current
banana
republic
catalogue
was
torn
to
pieces
at
a.m
a
bolt
of
lightning
struck
the
socalled
kissing
bridge
which
spanned
the
canal
between
bassey
park
and
derry
high
school
the
splintered
pieces
were
thrown
high
into
the
air
and
then
rained
down
into
the
swiftly
moving
canal
to
be
carried
away
the
wind
was
rising
at
a.m
the
gauge
in
the
lobby
of
the
courthouse
building
registered
it
at
just
over
fifteen
miles
an
hour
by
it
had
risen
to
twentyfour
miles
an
hour
at
a.m
mike
hanlon
awoke
in
his
room
at
the
derry
home
hospital
his
return
to
consciousness
was
a
kind
of
slow
dissolve
for
a
long
time
he
thought
he
was
dreaming
if
so
it
was
an
odd
sort
of
dream
an
anxiety
dream
his
old
psych
prof
doc
abelson
might
have
called
it
there
seemed
to
be
no
overt
reason
for
the
anxiety
but
it
was
there
all
the
same
the
plain
white
room
seemed
to
shriek
menace
he
gradually
realized
that
he
was
awake
the
plain
white
room
was
a
hospital
room
bottles
hung
over
his
head
one
full
of
clear
liquid
the
other
a
deep
dark
red
one
whole
blood
he
saw
a
blank
tv
set
bolted
to
the
wall
and
became
aware
of
the
steady
sound
of
rain
beating
against
the
window
mike
tried
to
move
his
legs
one
moved
freely
but
the
other
his
right
leg
wouldn't
move
at
all
the
feeling
in
that
leg
was
very
faint
and
he
realized
it
was
tightly
bandaged
little
by
little
it
came
back
he
had
settled
down
to
write
in
his
notebook
and
henry
bowers
had
turned
up
a
real
blast
from
the
past
a
golden
gasser
there
had
been
a
fight
and
henry
where
had
henry
gone
after
the
others
mike
groped
for
the
callbell
it
was
draped
over
the
head
of
the
bed
and
he
had
it
in
his
hands
when
the
door
opened
a
nurse
stood
there
two
buttons
of
his
white
tunic
were
unbuttoned
and
his
dark
hair
was
mussed
giving
him
a
rumpled
ben
casey
look
he
wore
a
saint
christopher
medal
around
his
neck
even
in
his
soupy
onlythreequarters
awake
state
mike
placed
him
immediately
in
a
sixteenyearold
girl
named
cheryl
lamonica
had
been
killed
in
derry
killed
by
it
the
girl
had
had
a
fourteen
yearold
brother
named
mark
and
this
was
him
mark
he
said
weakly
i
have
to
talk
to
you
shhh
mark
said
his
hand
was
in
his
pocket
no
talk
he
walked
into
the
room
and
as
he
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
mike
saw
with
a
hopeless
chill
how
blank
mark
lamonica
eyes
were
his
head
was
slightly
cocked
as
if
hearing
distant
music
he
took
his
hand
out
of
his
pocket
there
was
a
syringe
in
it
this
will
put
you
to
sleep
mark
said
and
began
to
walk
toward
the
bed
under
the
city
/
a.m
shhhh
bill
cried
suddenly
although
there
had
been
no
sound
except
their
own
faint
footsteps
richie
struck
a
light
the
walls
of
the
tunnel
had
moved
away
and
the
five
of
them
seemed
very
small
in
this
space
under
the
city
they
huddled
together
and
beverly
felt
a
dreamy
sense
of
déjà
vu
as
she
observed
the
gigantic
flagstones
on
the
floor
and
the
hanging
nets
of
cobweb
they
were
close
now
close
what
do
you
hear
she
asked
bill
trying
to
look
everywhere
as
the
match
in
richie
hand
burned
down
expecting
to
see
some
new
surprise
come
lurching
or
flying
out
of
the
darkness
rodan
anyone
the
alien
from
that
gruesome
movie
with
sigourney
weaver
a
great
scuttering
rat
with
orange
eyes
and
silver
teeth
but
there
was
nothing
only
the
dusty
smell
of
the
dark
and
far
away
the
thunder
of
running
water
as
if
the
drains
were
filling
up
sssomething

bill
said
his
eyes
were
hazy
and
distant
unemotional
all
of
his
alarm
was
in
his
tone
and
the
defensive
posture
of
his
body
he
hhhe
he
swallowed
there
was
a
click
in
his
throat
his
eyes
widened

groped
with

and
eddie
grasped
it
feebly
with
the
hand
at
the
end
of
his
broken
arm

completed
the
circle
by

strange
deep
voice

beverly
felt
something
go
out
from
them
and
toward
mike
her
head
rolled
on
her
shoulders
n
a
kind
of
ecstasy
and
the
harsh
whistle
of
eddie
breathing
merged
with
the
headlong
thunder
of
water
in
the
drains
no
mark
lamonica
said
in
a
low
voice
he
sighed
the
sigh
of
a
man
who
feels
orgasm
approaching
mike
pushed
the
call
button
in
his
hands
again
and
again
he
could
hear
it
ringing
at
the
nurses
station
down
the
hall
but
no
one
came
with
a
kind
of
hellish
second
sight
he
understood
that
the
nurses
were
sitting
around
down
there
reading
the
morning
paper
drinking
coffee
hearing
his
callbell
but
not
hearing
it
hearing
but
not
responding
they
would
respond
only
later
when
it
was
all
over
because
that
was
how
things
worked
in
derry
in
derry
some
things
were
better
not
seen
or
heard
until
they
were
over
mike
let
the
callbutton
fall
from
his
hands
mark
bent
toward
him
the
tip
of
the
syringe
glittering
his
saint
christopher
medal
swung
hypnotically
back
and
forth
as
he
drew
the
sheet
down
right
there
he
whispered
the
sternum
and
sighed
again
mike
suddenly
felt
power
wash
into
him
some
primitive
power
that
crammed
his
body
like
volts
he
stiffened
fingers
splaying
out
as
if
in
a
convulsion
his
eyes
widened
a
grunt
jerked
out
of
him
and
that
sense
of
dreadful
paralysis
was
driven
from
him
as
if
by
a
roundhouse
slap
his
right
hand
pistoned
out
toward
the
nighttable
there
was
a
plastic
pitcher
there
and
a
heavy
cafeteriastyle
waterglass
beside
it
his
hand
closed
around
the
glass
lamonica
sensed
the
change
that
dreamy
pleased
ight
disappeared
from
his
eyes
and
was
replaced
by
wary
confusion
he
drew
back
a
bit
and
then
mike
brought
the
glass
up
and
smashed
it
into
his
face
lamonica
screamed
and
staggered
backward
dropping
the
syringe
his
hands
went
to
his
spouting
face
blood
ran
down
his
wrists
and
splashed
on
his
white
tunic
the
power
left
as
suddenly
as
it
had
come
mike
looked
dully
at
the
shards
of
broken
glass
on
the
bed
and
his
hospital
johnny
and
his
own
bleeding
hand
he
heard
the
quick
light
sound
of
crepe
soled
shoes
in
the
hall
approaching
now
they
come
he
thought
oh
yes
now
and
after
they're
gone
who'll
show
up
who'll
show
up
next
as
they
burst
into
his
room
the
nurses
who
had
sat
calmly
on
station
as
his
callbell
rang
frantically
mke
closed
his
eyes
and
prayed
for
it
to
be
over
he
prayed
his
friends
were
somewhere
under
the
city
he
prayed
they
were
all
right
he
prayed
they
would
end
it
he
didn't
know
exactly
who
he
prayed
to
but
he
prayed
nonetheless
under
the
city/
a.m
he
aaall
ruhrigh
bill
said
presently
ben
didn't
know
how
long
they
had
stood
in
the
darkness
holding
hands
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
felt
something
something
from
them
from
their
circle
go
out
and
then
come
back
but
he
did
not
know
where
that
thing
if
it
existed
at
all
had
gone
or
done
are
you
sure
big
bill
richie
asked
yyyes
bill
released
richie
hand
and
beverly
but
we
ihave
to
finish
this
as
kwuh
quick
as
we
ccan
ccome
ohoh
on
they
went
on
richie
or
bill
periodically
lighting
matches
we
don't
have
so
much
as
a
peashooter
among
us
ben
thought
but
that
part
of
it
too
isn't
it
chiid
what
does
that
mean
what
was
it
exactly
what
was
its
final
face
and
even
if
we
didn't
kill
it
we
hurt
it
how
did
we
do
that
the
chamber
they
walked
through
it
could
no
longer
be
called
a
tunnel
grew
larger
and
larger
their
footfalls
echoed
ben
remembered
the
smell
that
thick
zoo
smell
he
became
aware
that
the
matches
were
no
longer
necessary
there
was
light
now
light
of
a
sort
a
ghastly
effulgence
that
was
growing
steadily
stronger
in
that
marshy
light
his
friends
all
looked
like
walking
corpses
wall
up
ahead
bill
eddie
said
tnuh
nuhknow
ben
felt
his
heart
begin
to
pick
up
speed
there
was
a
sour
taste
in
his
mouth
and
his
head
had
begun
to
ache
he
felt
slow
and
frightened
he
felt
fat
the
doo
beverly
whispered
yes
here
it
was
once
twentyseven
years
before
they
had
been
able
to
pass
through
that
door
by
doing
no
more
than
ducking
their
heads
now
they
would
have
to
duck
walk
their
way
through
or
crawl
on
hands
and
knees
they
had
grown
here
was
final
proof
if
final
proof
were
needed
the
pulsepoints
in
ben
neck
and
wrists
felt
hot
and
bloody
his
heart
had
picked
up
a
light
and
rapid
flutter
that
was
close
to
arrhythmia
pigeonpulse
he
thought
randomly
and
licked
his
lips
bright
greenishyellow
light
flooded
out
from
under
the
door
it
shot
through
the
ornate
keyhole
in
a
twisting
shaft
that
looked
almost
thick
enough
to
cut
the
mark
was
on
the
door
and
again
they
all
saw
something
different
in
that
strange
device
beverly
saw
tom
face
bill
saw
audra
severed
head
with
blank
eyes
that
stared
at
him
in
dreadful
accusation
eddie
saw
a
grinning
skull
poised
over
two
crossed
bones
the
symbol
for
poison
richie
saw
the
bearded
face
of
a
degenerate
paul
bunyan
eyes
narrowed
to
killer
slits
and
ben
saw
henry
bowers
bill
are

strong
enough
he
asked
can

i

bill
said
what

beverly
asked
in
a
small
voice
tom

mocked

ibit
not
bill
said
pluhhaces
like

luhluhlocked
he
placed
the
tented
fingers
of
his
right
hand
on
the
door
he
had
to
bend
over
to
do
it
and
pushed
it
swung
open
on
a
flood
of
sick
yellowgreen
light
that
zoo
smell
wafted
out
at
them
the
smell
of
the
past
become
the
present
horribly
alive
obscenely
vital
roll
wheel
bill
thought
randomly
and
looked
around
at
them
then
he
dropped
to
his
hands
and
knees
beverly
followed
then
richie
then
eddie
ben
came
last
his
flesh
crawling
at
the
feel
of
the
ancient
grit
on
the
floor
he
passed
through
the
portal
and
as
he
straightened
up
in
the
weird
glow
of
fire
crawling
up
and
down
the
dripping
stone
walls
in
snakes
of
light
the
last
memory
socked
home
with
the
force
of
a
psychic
battering
ram
he
cried
out
staggering
back
one
hand
going
to
his
head
and
his
first
incoherent
thought
was
no
wonder
stan
committed
suicide
oh
god
i
wish
i
had
he
saw
the
same
expressions
of
stunned
horror
and
dawning
realization
on
the
faces
of
the
others
as
the
last
key
turned
in
the
last
lock
then
beverly
was
shrieking
clinging
to
bill
as
it
raced
down
the
gossamer
curtain
of
its
webbing
a
nightmare
spider
from
beyond
time
and
space
a
spider
from
beyond
the
fevered
imaginings
of
whatever
inmates
may
live
in
the
deepest
depths
of
hell
no
bill
thought
coldly
not
a
spider
either
not
really
but
this
shape
isn't
one
it
picked
out
of
our
minds
it
just
the
closest
our
minds
can
come
to
the
deadlights
whatever
it
really
is
it
was
perhaps
fifteen
feet
high
and
as
black
as
a
moonless
night
each
of
its
legs
was
as
thick
as
a
musclebuilder
thigh
its
eyes
were
bright
malevolent
rubies
bulging
from
sockets
filled
with
some
dripping
chromiumcolored
fluid
its
jagged
mandibles
opened
and
closed
opened
and
closed
dripping
ribbons
of
foam
frozen
in
an
ecstasy
of
horror
tottering
on
the
brink
of
utter
lunacy
ben
observed
with
an
eyeofthestorm
calm
that
this
foam
was
alive
it
struck
the
stinking
stoneflagged
floor
and
then
began
to
writhe
away
into
the
cracks
like
protozoa
but
it
something
else
there
some
final
shape
one
that
i
can
almost
see
the
way
you
might
see
the
shape
of
aman
moving
behind
a
movie
screen
while
the
show
is
on
some
other
shape
but
i
don't
want
to
see
it
please
god
don't
let
me
see
it
and
it
didn't
matter
dd
it
they
were
seeing
what
they
were
seeing
and
ben
understood
somehow
that
it
was
imprisoned
in
this
final
shape
the
shape
of
the
spider
by
their
common
unsought
and
unfathered
vision
it
was
against
this
it
that
they
would
live
or
die
the
creature
was
squealing
and
mewling
and
ben
became
quite
sure
he
was
hearing
sounds
it
made
twice
in
his
head
and
then
a
split
second
later
in
his
ears
telepathic
he
thought
i’m
reading
its
mind
its
shadow
was
a
squat
egg
that
raced
along
the
ancient
wall
of
this
keep
that
was
its
lair
its
body
was
covered
by
coarse
hair
and
ben
saw
that
it
was
possessed
of
a
stinger
long
enough
to
impale
a
man
a
clear
fluid
dripped
from
its
tip
and
ben
saw
that
this
was
also
alive
like
the
saliva
the
poison
writhed
away
into
the
cracks
of
the
floor
its
stinger
yes
but
below
that
its
belly
bulged
grotesquely
almost
dragging
on
the
floor
as
it
moved
now
changing
direction
slightly
heading
unerringly
toward
their
leader
toward
big
bill
that
its
eggsac
ben
thought
and
his
mind
seemed
to
shriek
at
the
implication
whatever
it
is
beyond
what
we
see
this
representation
is
at
least
symbolically
correct
it
female
and
it
pregnant
it
was
pregnant
then
and
none
of
us
knew
except
stan
oh
jesus
christ
yes
it
was
stan
stan
not
mike
stan
who
understood
stan
who
told
us
that
why
we
had
to
come
back
no
matter
what
because
it
is
female
it
pregnant
with
some
unimaginable
spawn
and
its
time
has
drawn
close
incredibly
bill
denbrough
was
stepping
forward
to
meet
it
bill
no
beverly
screamed
stuhstuhstay
bbback
bill
shouted
without
looking
around
and
then
richie
was
running
toward
him
shouting
his
name
and
ben
found
his
own
legs
in
motion
he
seemed
to
feel
a
phantom
stomach
swaying
in
front
of
him
and
he
welcomed
the
sensation
got
to
become
a
child
again
he
thought
incoherently
that
the
only
way
i
can
keep
it
from
driving
me
crazy
got
to
become
a
kid
again
got
to
accept
it
somehow
running
shouting
bill
name
vaguely
aware
that
eddie
was
running
beside
him
his
broken
arm
flopping
the
belt
of
the
bathrobe
bill
had
cinched
around
it
now
trailing
on
the
floor
eddie
had
drawn
his
aspirator
he
looked
like
a
crazed
malnourished
gunslinger
with
some
weird
pistol
ben
heard
bill
bellow
you
kkkilled
my
brother
you
fuhfuhfucking
bitch
then
it
was
rearing
up
over
bill
burying
bill
in
its
shadow
its
legs
pawing
the
air
ben
heard
its
eager
mewling
looked
into
its
timeless
evil
red
eyes
and
for
an
instant
did
see
the
shape
behind
the
shape
saw
lights
saw
an
endless
crawling
hairy
thing
which
was
made
of
light
and
nothing
else
orange
light
dead
light
that
mocked
life
the
ritual
began
for
the
second
time
chapter
the
ritual
of
chüd
in
the
lair
of
it/
it
was
bill
who
held
them
together
as
that
great
black
spider
raced
down
its
web
creating
a
noxious
breeze
that
tousled
their
hair
stan
shrieked
like
a
baby
his
brown
eyes
bulging
from
their
sockets
his
fingers
harrowing
his
cheeks
ben
backed
slowly
away
until
his
ample
ass
struck
the
wall
to
the
left
of
the
door
he
felt
cold
fire
burn
through
his
pants
and
stepped
away
again
but
dreamily
surely
none
of
this
could
be
happening
it
was
simply
the
world
worst
nightmare
he
found
he
could
not
lift
his
hands
they
seemed
to
have
big
weights
tied
to
them
richie
found
his
eyes
drawn
to
that
web
hanging
here
and
there
partially
wrapped
in
silken
strands
that
seemed
to
move
as
if
alive
were
a
number
of
rotted
halfeaten
bodies
he
thought
he
recognized
eddie
corcoran
near
the
ceiling
although
both
of
eddie
legs
and
one
of
his
arms
were
gone
beverly
and
mike
clung
to
each
other
like
hansel
and
gretel
in
the
woods
watching
paralyzed
as
the
spider
reached
the
floor
and
scrabbled
toward
them
its
distorted
shadow
racing
along
beside
it
on
the
wall
bill
looked
around
at
them
a
tall
skinny
boy
in
a
mudandsewagesplattered
teeshirt
that
had
once
been
white
jeans
with
cuffs
mudcaked
keds
his
hair
lay
across
his
forehead
and
his
eyes
were
blazing
he
surveyed
them
seemed
to
dismiss
them
and
turned
back
toward
the
spider
and
incredibly
he
began
to
cross
the
room
toward
it
not
running
but
walking
fast
his
elbows
cocked
his
forearms
corded
his
hands
fisted
yuhyuhyou
kkkilled
my
bruhhothe
no
bill
beverly
shrieked
struggling
free
of
mike
embrace
and
running
toward
bill
her
red
hair
flying
out
behind
her
leave
him
alone
she
screamed
at
the
spider
don't
you
touch
hi
shit
beverly
ben
thought
and
then
he
was
running
too
stomach
swaying
back
and
forth
in
front
of
him
legs
pumping
he
was
vaguely
aware
that
eddie
kaspbrak
was
running
on
his
left
holding
his
aspirator
in
his
good
hand
like
a
pistol
and
then
it
was
rearing
up
over
bill
who
was
unarmed
it
buried
bill
in
its
shadow
its
legs
pawing
at
the
air
ben
grabbed
for
beverly
shoulder
his
hand
slapped
it
then
slipped
off
she
turned
toward
him
her
eyes
wild
her
ips
drawn
back
from
her
teeth
help
hi
she
screamed
how
ben
screamed
back
he
wheeled
toward
the
spider
heard
its
eager
mewling
looked
into
its
timeless
evil
eyes
and
saw
something
behind
the
shape
something
much
worse
than
a
spider
something
that
was
all
insane
light
his
courage
faltered
but
it
was
bev
who
had
asked
him
bev
and
he
loved
her
goddam
you
leave
bill
alon
he
shrieked
a
moment
later
a
hand
swatted
his
back
so
hard
he
almost
fell
over
it
was
richie
and
although
tears
were
running
down
his
cheeks
richie
was
grinning
madly
the
corners
of
his
mouth
seemed
to
reach
almost
to
the
lobes
of
his
ears
spit
leaked
out
between
his
teeth
let
get
her
haystack
richie
screamed
chiid
chii
her
ben
thought
stupidly
her
did
he
say
aloud
okay
but
what
is
it
what
chiid
'
frocked
if
i
know
richie
yelled
then
ran
toward
bill
and
into
the
shadow
of
it
it
had
somehow
squatted
on
its
rear
legs
its
front
legs
pawed
the
air
just
over
bill
head
and
stan
uris
forced
to
approach
compelled
to
approach
in
spite
of
every
instinct
in
his
mind
and
body
saw
that
bill
was
staring
up
at
it
his
blue
eyes
fixed
on
its
inhuman
orange
ones
eyes
from
which
that
awful
corpselight
spilled
stan
stopped
understanding
that
the
ritual
of
chiid
whatever
that
was
had
begun
bill
in
the
void
/
early

are

why

like

like

human
cannonball
at
the
shrine
circus
that
came
to
derry
each
may
he
was
picked
up
and
heaved
across
the
spider
chamber
it
only
in
my
mind
he
screamed
at
himself
my
body
still
standing
right
there

to
eye
with
it
be
brave
it
only
a
mindtrick
be

stand
stand
thrusts
roaring
forward
slamming
into
a
black
and
dripping
tunnel
lined
with
decaying
crumbling
tiles
that
were
fifty
years
old
a
hundred
a
thousand
a
milliombillion
who
knew
rushing
in
deadly
silence
past
intersections
some
lit
by
that
twisting
green
yellow
fire
some
by
glowing
balloons
full
of
a
ghastly
white
skulllight
others
dead
black
he
was
thrown
at
a
speed
of
a
thousand
miles
an
hour
past
piles
of
bones
some
human
some
not
speeding
like
a
rocket
powered
dart
in
a
windtunnel
now
angling
upward
but
not
toward
light
but
toward
dark
some
titanic
dark
his
fists
and
exploding
outward
into
utter
blackness
the
blackness
was
everything
the
blackness
was
the
cosmos
and
the
universe
and
the
floor
of
the
blackness
was
hard
hard
it
was
like
polished
ebonite
and
he
was
skidding
along
on
his
chest
and
belly
and
thighs
like
a
weight
on
a
shuffleboard
he
was
on
the
ballroom
floor
of
eternity
and
eternity
was
black
against
the
posts
stop
that
why
do
you
say
that
that
won't
help
you
stupid
boy
and
still
insists
he
sees
the
ghosts
stop
it
he
thrusts
his
fists
against
the
posts
and
still
insists
he
sees
the
ghosts
stop
it
stop
it
i
demand
i
command
that
you
stop
it
don't
like
that
do
you
and
thinking
if
i
could
only
say
it
out
loud
say
it
without
stuttering
i
could
break
this
illusion
this
is
no
illusion
you
foolish
little
boy
this
is
eternity
my
eternity
and
you
are
lost
in
it
lost
forever
never
to
find
your
way
back
you
are
eternal
now
and
condemned
to
wander
in
the
black
after
you
meet
me
face
to
face
that
is
but
there
was
something
else
here
bill
sensed
it
felt
it
in
a
crazy
way
smelled
it
some
large
presence
ahead
in
the
dark
a
shape
he
felt
not
fear
but
a
sense
of
overmastering
awe
here
was
a
power
which
dwarfed
its
power
and
bill
had
only
time
to
think
incoherently
please
please
whatever
you
are
remember
that
i
am
very
small
he
rushed
toward
it
and
saw
it
was
a
great
turtle
its
shell
plated
with
many
blazing
colors
its
ancient
reptilian
head
slowly
poked
out
of
its
shell
and
bill
thought
he
felt
a
vague
contemptuous
surprise
from
the
thing
that
had
cast
him
out
here
the
eyes
of
the
turtle
were
kind
bill
thought
it
must
be
the
oldest
thing
anyone
could
imagine
older
by
far
than
it
which
had
claimed
to
be
eternal
what
are
you
i'm
the
turtle
son
i
made
the
universe
but
please
don't
blame
me
for
it
i
had
a
bellyache
help
me
please
help
me
i
take
no
stand
in
these
matters
my
brother
has
his
own
place
in
the
macroverse
energy
is
eternal
as
even
a
child
such
as
yourself
must
understand
he
was
flying
past
the
turtle
now
and
even
at
his
tremendous
skidding
speed
the
turtle
plated
side
seemed
to
go
on
and
on
to
his
right
he
thought
dimly
of
riding
in
a
train
and
passing
one
going
in
the
other
direction
a
train
that
was
so
long
it
seemed
eventually
to
stand
still
or
even
move
backward
he
could
still
hear
it
yammering
and
buzzing
its
voice
high
and
angry
not
human
full
of
mad
hate
but
when
the
turtle
spoke
its
voice
was
blanked
out
utterly
the
turtle
spoke
in
bill
head
and
bill
understood
somehow
that
there
was
yet
another
and
that
final
other
dwelt
in
a
void
beyond
this
one
this
final
other
was
perhaps
the
creator
of
the
turtle
which
only
watched
and
it
which
only
ate
this
other
was
a
force
beyond
the
universe
a
power
beyond
all
other
power
the
author
of
all
there
was
suddenly
he
thought
he
understood
it
meant
to
hrust
him
through
some
wall
at
the
end
of
the
universe
and
into
some
other
place
what
that
old
turtle
called
the
macroverse
where
it
really
lived
where
it
existed
as
a
titanic
glowing
core
which
might
be
no
more
than
the
smallest
mote
in
that
other
mind
he
would
see
it
naked
a
thing
of
unshaped
destroying
light
and
there
he
would
either
be
mercifully
annihilated
or
live
forever
insane
and
yet
conscious
inside
its
homicidal
endless
formless
hungry
being
please
help
me
for
the
others
you
must
help
yourself
son
but
how
please
tell
me
how
how
how
he
had
reached
the
turtle
heavily
scaled
back
legs
now
there
was
time
enough
to
observe
its
titanic
yet
ancient
flesh
time
to
be
struck
with
the
wonder
of
its
heavy
toenails
they
were
an
odd
bluishyellow
color
and
he
could
see
galaxies
swimming
in
each
one
please
you
are
good
i
sense
and
believe
that
you
are
good
and
i
am
begging
you
won't
you
please
help
me
you
already
know
there
is
only
chiid
and
your
friends
please
oh
please
son
you've
got
to
thrust
your
fists
against
the
posts
and
still
insist
you
see
the
ghosts
that
all
i
can
tell
you
once
you
get
into
cosmological
shit
like
this
you
got
to
throw
away
the
instruction
manual
he
realized
the
voice
of
the
turtle
was
fading
he
was
beyond
it
now
bulleting
into
a
darkness
that
was
deeper
than
deep
the
turtle
voice
was
being
overcome
overmastered
by
the
gleeful
gibbering
voice
of
the
thing
that
had
thrust
him
out
ad
into
this
black
void
the
voice
of
the
spider
of
it
how
do
you
like
it
out
here
little
friend
do
you
like
it
do
you
love
it
do
you
give
it
ninetyeight
points
because
it
has
a
good
beat
and
you
can
dance
to
it
can
you
catch
it
on
your
tonsils
and
heave
it
left
and
right
did
you
enjoy
meeting
my
friend
the
turtle
i
thought
that
stupid
old
fuck
died
years
ago
and
for
all
the
good
he
could
do
you
he
might
as
well
have
did
you
think
he
could
help
you
no
no
no
no
he
thrusts
no
he
thuhthuhhuhhuhrusts
no
stop
babbling
the
time
is
short
let
us
talk
while
we
still
can
tell
me
about
yourself
little
friend
tell
me
do
you
love
all
the
cold
dark
out
here
are
you
enjoying
your
grand
tour
of
the
nothingness
that
lies
outside
wait
until
you
break
through
little
friend
wait
until
you
break
through
to
where
i
am
wait
for
that
wait
for
the
deadlights
you'll
look
and
you'll
go
mad
but
you'll
live
and
live
and
live
inside
them
inside
me
it
screamed
noxious
laughter
and
bill
became
aware
that
its
voice
was
beginning
both
to
fade
and
to
swell
as
if
he
was
simultaneously
drawing
out
of
its
range
and
hurtling
into
it
and
wasn't
that
just
what
was
happening
yes
he
thought
it
was
because
while
the
voices
were
in
perfect
sync
the
one
he
was
now
rushing
toward
was
totally
alien
speaking
syllables
no
human
tongue
or
throat
could
reproduce
that
the
voice
of
the
deadlights
he
thought
the
time
is
short
let
us
talk
while
we
still
can
its
human
voice
fading
the
way
the
bangor
radio
stations
faded
when
you
were
in
the
car
and
travelling
south
bright
flaring
terror
filled
him
he
would
shortly
be
beyond
sane
communication
with
it
and
some
part
of
him
understood
that
for
all
its
laughter
for
all
its
alien
glee
that
was
what
it
wanted
not
just
to
send
him
out
to
whatever
it
really
was
but
to
break
their
mental
communication
if
that
ceased
he
would
be
utterly
destroyed
to
pass
beyond
communication
was
to
pass
beyond
salvation
he
understood
that
much
from
the
way
his
parents
had
behaved
toward
him
after
george
had
died
it
was
the
only
lesson
their
refrigerator
coldness
had
had
to
teach
him
leaving
it
and
approaching
it
but
the
leaving
was
somehow
more
important
if
it
wanted
to
eat
little
kids
out
here
or
suck
them
in
or
whatever
it
did
why
hadn't
it
sent
them
all
out
here
why
just
him
because
it
had
to
rid
its
spiderself
of
him
that
was
why
somehow
the
spiderit
and
the
it
which
it
called
the
deadlights
were
linked
whatever
lived
out
here
in
the
black
might
be
invulnerable
when
it
was
here
and
nowhere
else
but
it
was
also
on
earth
under
derry
in
a
form
that
was
physical
however
repulsive
it
might
be
in
derry
it
was
physical
and
what
was
physical
could
be
killed
bill
skidded
through
the
dark
his
speed
still
increasing
why
do
i
sense
so
much
of
its
talk
is
nothing
but
a
bluff
a
big
shuckand
jive
why
should
that
be
how
can
that
be
he
understood
how
maybe
just
maybe
there
is
only
chiid
the
turtle
had
said
and
suppose
this
was
it
suppose
they
had
bitten
deep
into
each
other
tongues
not
physically
but
mentally
spiritually
and
suppose
that
if
it
could
throw
bill
far
enough
into
the
void
far
enough
toward
its
eternal
discorporate
self
the
ritual
would
be
over
it
would
have
ripped
him
free
killed
him
and
won
everything
all
at
the
same
you're
doing
good
son
but
very
shortly
it
going
to
be
too
late
it
scared
scared
of
me
scared
of
all
of
us
skidding
he
was
skidding
and
there
was
a
wall
up
ahead
he
sensed
it
sensed
it
in
the
dark
the
wall
at
the
edge
of
the
continuum
and
beyond
it
the
other
shape
the
deadlights
don't
talk
to
me
son
and
don't
talk
to
yourself
it
tearing
you
loose
bite
in
if
you
care
if
you
dare
if
you
can
be
brave
if
you
can
stand
bite
in
son
bill
bit
in
not
with
his
teeth
but
with
teeth
in
his
mind
dropping
his
voice
a
full
register
making
it
not
his
own
making
it
in
fact
his
father
voice
although
bill
would
go
to
his
grave
not
knowing
this
some
secrets
are
never
known
and
it
probably
better
so
drawing
in
a
great
breath
he
cried
he
thrusts
his
fists
against
the
posts
and
still
insists
he
sees
the
ghosts
now
let
me
g
he
felt
it
scream
in
his
mind
a
scream
of
frustrated
petulant
rage
but
it
was
also
a
scream
of
fear
and
pain
it
was
not
used
to
not
having
its
own
way
such
a
thing
had
never
happened
to
it
and
until
the
most
recent
moments
d
its
existence
it
had
not
suspected
such
a
thing
could
bill
felt
it
writhing
at
him
not
pulling
but
pushing
trying
to
get
him
away
thrusts
his
fists
against
the
posts
i
said
stop
it
bring
me
back
you
must
i
command
it
i
demand
it
it
screamed
again
its
pain
more
intense
now
perhaps
partly
because
while
it
had
spent
its
long
long
existence
inflicting
pain
feeding
on
it
it
had
never
experienced
it
as
a
part
of
itself
still
it
tried
to
push
him
to
get
rid
of
him
blindly
and
stubbornly
insisting
on
winning
as
it
had
always
won
before
it
pushed
but
bill
sensed
that
his
outward
speed
had
slowed
and
a
grotesque
image
came
into
his
mind
its
tongue
covered
with
that
living
spittle
extended
like
a
thick
rubber
band
cracking
bleeding
he
saw
himself
clinging
to
the
tip
of
that
tongue
by
his
teeth
ripping
through
it
a
little
at
a
time
his
face
bathed
in
the
convulsive
ichor
that
was
its
blood
drowning
in
its
dead
stench
yet
still
holding
on
holding
on
somehow
while
it
struggled
in
its
blind
pain
and
towering
rage
not
to
let
its
tongue
snap
back
chiid
this
chiid
stand
be
brave
be
true
stand
for
your
brother
your
friends
believe
believe
in
all
the
things
you
have
believed
in
believe
that
if
you
tell
the
policeman
you're
lost
he'll
see
that
you
get
home
safely
that
there
is
a
tooth
fairy
who
lives
in
a
huge
enamel
castle
and
santa
claus
below
the
north
pole
making
toys
with
his
trove
of
elves
and
that
captain
midnight
could
be
real
yes
he
could
be
in
spite
of
calvin
and
cissy
clark
big
brother
carlton
saying
that
was
all
a
lot
of
baby
stuff
believe
that
your
mother
and
father
will
love
you
again
that
courage
ts
possible
and
words
will
come
smoothly
every
time
no
more
losers
no
more
cowering
in
a
hole
in
the
ground
and
calling
it
a
clubhouse
no
more
crying
in
georgie
room
because
you
couldn't
save
him
and
didn't
know
believe
in
yourself
believe
in
the
heat
of
that
desire
he
suddenly
began
to
laugh
in
the
darkness
not
in
hysteria
but
in
utter
delighted
amazement
oh
shit
i
believe
in
all
of
those
things
he
shouted
and
it
was
true
even
at
eleven
he
had
observed
that
things
turned
out
right
a
ridiculous
amount
of
the
tune
light
flared
around
him
he
raised
his
arms
out
and
above
his
head
he
turned
his
face
up
and
suddenly
he
felt
power
rush
through
him
he
heard
it
scream
again
and
suddenly
he
was
being
drawn
back
the
way
he
had
come
still
holding
that
image
of
his
teeth
planted
deep
in
the
strange
meat
of
its
tongue
his
teeth
locked
together
like
grim
old
death
he
flew
through
the
dark
legs
trailing
behind
him
the
tips
of
his
mudcrusted
sneaker
laces
flying
like
pennants
the
wind
of
this
empty
place
blowing
in
his
ears
he
was
pulled
past
the
turtle
and
saw
that
its
head
had
withdrawn
into
its
shell
its
voice
emerged
hollow
and
distorted
as
if
even
the
shell
it
lived
in
were
a
well
eternities
deep
not
bad
son
but
i'd
finish
it
now
don't
let
it
get
away
energy
has
a
way
of
dissipating
you
know
what
can
be
done
when
you're
eleven
can
often
never
be
done
again
the
voice
of
the
turtle
faded
faded
faded
there
was
only
the
rushing
dark
and
then
the
mouth
of
a
cyclopean
tunnel
smells
of
age
and
decay
cobwebs
brushing
at
his
face
like
rotted
skeins
of
silk
in
a
haunted
house
moldering
tiles
blurring
by
intersections
all
dark
now
the
moorballoons
all
gone
and
it
was
screaming
screaming
let
me
go
let
me
go
i'll
leave
never
come
back
let
me
go
it
hurts
it
hurts
it
hurrrrrrrrrr
thrusts
his
fists
bill
screamed
nearly
delirious
now
he
could
see
light
ahead
but
it
was
fading
guttering
like
great
candles
which
had
at
last
burned
low
and
for
a
moment
he
saw
himself
and
the
others
holding
hands
in
a
line
eddie
on
one
side
of
him
and
richie
on
the
other
he
saw
his
own
body
sagging
his
head
rolled
back
on
his
neck
staring
up
at
the
spider
which
twisted
and
whirled
like
a
dervish
its
coarse
spiny
legs
beating
at
the
floor
poison
dripping
from
its
stinger
it
was
screaming
in
its
deathagony
so
bill
honestly
believed
then
he
was
slamming
back
into
his
body
with
all
the
impact
of
a
line
drive
slamming
into
a
baseball
glove
the
force
of
it
tearing
his
hands
loose
from
richie
and
eddie
driving
him
to
his
knees
and
skidding
him
across
the
floor
to
the
edge
of
the
web
he
reached
out
for
one
of
the
strands
without
thinking
and
his
hand
immediately
went
numb
as
if
it
had
been
injected
with
a
hypo
full
of
novocaine
the
grand
itself
was
as
thick
as
a
telephonepole
guy
wire
don't
touch
that
bill
ben
yelled
and
bill
yanked
his
hand
away
in
one
quick
jerk
leaving
a
raw
place
across
his
palm
just
below
the
fingers
it
filled
with
blood
and
he
staggered
to
his
feet
eyes
on
the
spider
it
was
scrabbling
away
from
them
making
its
way
into
the
growing
dimness
at
the
back
of
the
chamber
as
the
light
failed
it
left
puddles
and
pools
of
black
blood
behind
as
it
went
somehow
their
confrontation
had
ruptured
its
insides
in
a
dozen
maybe
a
hundred
places
bill
the
we
mike
screamed
look
out
he
stepped
backward
craning
his
neck
up
as
strands
of
its
web
came
floating
down
striking
the
stoneflagged
floor
on
either
side
of
him
like
the
bodies
of
meaty
white
snakes
they
immediately
began
to
lose
shape
to
flow
into
the
cracks
between
the
stones
the
web
was
falling
apart
coming
loose
from
its
many
moorings
one
of
the
bodies
wrapped
up
like
a
fly
came
plunging
down
to
strike
the
floor
with
a
sickening
rotted
gourd
sound
the
spider
bill
yelled
where
is
i
he
could
still
hear
it
in
his
head
mewling
and
crying
out
in
its
pain
and
understood
dimly
that
it
had
gone
into
the
same
tunnel
it
had
thrown
bill
into
but
had
it
gone
in
there
to
flee
back
to
the
place
where
it
had
meant
to
send
bill
or
to
hide
until
they
were
gone
to
die
or
escape
christ
the
lights
richie
shouted
the
jights're
going
out
what
happened
bill
where
did
you
go
we
thought
you
were
dead
in
some
confused
part
of
his
mind
bill
knew
that
wasn't
true
if
they
had
really
thought
him
dead
they
would
have
run
scattered
and
it
would
have
picked
them
off
easily
one
by
one
or
perhaps
it
would
be
truer
to
say
that
they
had
thought
him
dead
but
believed
him
alive
we
have
to
make
sure
if
it
dying
or
gone
back
to
where
it
came
from
where
the
rest
of
it
is
that
fine
but
what
if
ifs
just
hurt
what
if
it
can
get
better
whatstan
shriek
cut
across
his
thoughts
like
broken
glass
in
the
fading
light
bill
saw
that
one
of
the
strands
of
webbing
had
come
down
on
stan
shoulder
before
bill
could
reach
him
alike
had
thrown
himself
at
the
smaller
boy
in
a
flying
tackle
he
drove
stan
away
and
the
piece
of
webbing
snapped
back
taking
a
piece
of
stan
polo
shirt
with
it
get
back
ben
yelled
at
them
get
away
from
it
it
all
coming
dow
he
seized
beverly
hand
and
pulled
her
back
toward
the
childsized
door
while
stan
struggled
to
his
feet
looked
dazedly
around
and
then
grabbed
eddie
the
two
of
them
started
toward
ben
and
beverly
helping
each
other
looking
like
phantoms
in
the
fading
light
overhead
the
spiderweb
was
drooping
collapsing
on
itself
losing
its
fearful
symmetry
bodies
twirled
lazily
in
the
air
lke
nightmarish
plumbbobs
crossstrands
fell
in
like
the
rotted
rungs
of
some
strange
complex
of
ladders
severed
strands
hit
the
stone
flagging
hissed
like
cats
lost
their
shape
began
to
run
mike
hanlon
wove
his
way
through
them
as
he
would
later
weave
his
way
through
the
opposing
lines
of
nearly
a
dozen
highschool
football
teams
head
down
ducking
and
dodging
richie
joined
him
incredibly
richie
was
laughing
although
his
hair
was
standing
straight
up
on
his
head
like
the
quills
of
a
porcupine
the
light
grew
dimmer
the
phosphorescence
that
had
coiled
on
the
walls
now
dying
away
bill
mike
shouted
come
on
get
the
frock
out
of
there
what
if
it
not
dead
bill
screamed
back
we
got
to
go
after
it
mike
we
got
to
make
sure
a
snarl
of
webbing
sagged
outward
like
a
parachute
and
then
fell
with
a
nasty
ripping
sound
that
was
like
skin
being
pulled
apart
mike
grabbed
bill
arm
and
pulled
him
stumbling
out
of
the
way
its
dead
eddie
cried
joining
them
his
eyes
were
febrile
lamps
his
breathing
a
chilly
winter
whistle
in
his
throat
fallen
strands
of
webbing
had
sizzled
complex
scars
into
the
plaster
of
paris
of
his
cast
i
heard
it
it
was
dying
you
don't
sound
like
that
if
you're
on
your
way
to
a
sock
hop
it
was
dying
i'm
sure
of
i
richie
hands
groped
out
of
the
darkness
seized
bill
and
pulled
him
into
a
rough
embrace
he
began
to
pound
bill
back
ecstatically
i
heard
it
too
it
was
dying
big
bill
it
was
dying
and
you're
not
stuttering
not
at
all
howdja
do
it
how
in
the
hell
'
bill
brain
was
whirling
exhaustion
tugged
at
him
with
thick
and
clumsy
hands
he
could
not
remember
ever
feeling
this
tired
but
in
his
mind
he
heard
the
drawling
almost
weary
voice
of
the
turtle
i'd
finish
it
now
don't
let
it
get
away
what
can
be
done
when
you're
eleven
can
often
never
be
done
again
but
we
have
to
be
sure
the
shadows
were
joining
hands
and
now
the
darkness
was
almost
complete
but
before
the
light
failed
utterly
he
thought
he
saw
the
same
hellish
doubt
on
beverly
face
and
in
stan
eyes
and
still
as
the
last
of
the
light
gave
way
they
could
hear
the
tenebrous
whisper
shudderthump
of
its
unspeakable
web
falling
to
pieces
bill
in
the
void
/
late
well
here
you
are
again
little
buddy
but
what
happened
to
your
hair
you're
just
as
bald
as
a
cueball
sad
what
sad
short
lives
humans
live
each
life
a
short
pamphlet
written
by
an
idiot
tuttut
and
all
that
i'm
still
bill
denbrough
you
killed
my
brother
and
you
killed
stan
the
man
you
tried
to
kill
mike
and
i'm
going
to
tell
you
something
this
time
i'm
not
going
to
stop
until
the
job
done
the
turtle
was
stupid
too
stupid
to
lie
he
told
you
the
truth
little
buddy
the
time
only
comes
around
once
you
hurt
me
you
surprised
me
never
again
i
am
the
one
who
called
you
back
i
you
called
all
right
but
you
weren't
the
only
one
your
friend
the
turtle
he
died
a
few
years
ago
the
old
idiot
puked
inside
his
shell
and
choked
to
death
on
a
galaxy
or
two
very
sad
don't
you
think
but
also
quite
bizarre
deserves
a
place
in
ripley
believe
it
or
not
that
what
i
think
happened
right
around
the
same
time
you
had
that
writer
block
you
must
have
felt
him
go
little
buddy
i
don't
believe
that
either
oh
you'll
believe
you'll
see
this
time
little
buddy
i
intend
you
to
see
everything
including
the
deadlights
he
sensed
its
voice
rising
buzzing
and
racketing
at
last
he
sensed
the
full
extent
of
its
fury
and
he
was
terrified
he
reached
for
the
tongue
of
its
mind
concentrating
trying
desperately
to
recapture
the
full
extent
of
that
childish
belief
understanding
at
the
same
time
that
there
was
a
deadly
truth
in
what
it
had
said
last
time
it
had
been
unprepared
this
time
well
even
if
it
had
not
been
the
only
one
to
call
them
it
sure
had
been
waiting
but
still
he
felt
his
own
fury
clean
and
singing
as
his
eyes
fixed
on
its
eyes
he
sensed
its
old
scars
sensed
that
it
had
truly
been
hurt
and
that
it
was
still
hurt
and
as
it
threw
him
as
he
felt
his
mind
swatted
out
of
his
body
he
concentrated
all
of
his
being
on
seizing
its
tongue
and
missed
his
grip
richie
the
other
four
watched
paralyzed
it
was
an
exact
replay
of
what
had
happened
before
at
first
the
spider
which
seemed
about
to
seize
bill
and
gobble
him
up
grew
suddenly
still
bill
eyes
locked
with
its
ruby
ones
there
was
a
sense
of
contact
a
contact
just
beyond
their
ability
to
divine
but
they
felt
the
struggle
the
clash
of
wills
then
richie
glanced
up
into
the
new
web
and
saw
the
first
difference
there
were
bodies
there
some
halfeaten
and
halfrotted
and
that
was
the
same
but
high
up
in
one
corner
was
another
body
and
richie
was
sure
this
one
was
still
fresh
possibly
even
still
alive
beverly
had
not
looked
up
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
bill
and
the
spider
but
even
in
his
terror
richie
saw
the
resemblance
between
beverly
and
the
woman
in
the
web
her
hair
was
long
and
red
her
eyes
were
open
but
glassy
and
unmoving
a
line
of
spittle
had
run
from
the
left
corner
of
her
mouth
down
to
her
chin
she
had
been
attached
to
one
of
the
web
main
cables
by
a
gossamer
harness
that
went
around
her
vaist
and
under
both
arms
so
that
she
lolled
forward
in
a
halfbow
arms
and
legs
dangling
limply
her
feet
were
bare
richie
saw
another
body
crumpled
at
the
foot
of
her
web
a
man
he
had
never
seen
before
and
yet
his
mind
registered
an
almost
subconscious
resemblance
to
the
late
unlamented
henry
bowers
blood
had
run
from
both
of
the
stranger
eyes
and
caked
in
a
foam
around
his
mouth
and
on
his
chin
he
then
beverly
was
screaming
something
wrong
something
gone
wrong
do
something
for
christ
sake
won't
somebody
do
something
richie
gaze
snapped
back
to
bill
and
the
spider
and
he
sensed
/
heard
monstrous
laughter
bill
face
was
stretching
in
some
subtle
way
his
skin
had
gone
parchment
sallow
as
shiny
as
the
skin
of
a
very
old
person
his
eyes
were
rolled
up
to
the
whites
oh
bill
where
are
you
as
richie
watched
blood
suddenly
burst
from
bill
nose
in
a
foam
his
mouth
was
writhing
trying
to
scream
and
now
the
spider
was
advancing
on
him
again
it
was
turning
presenting
its
stinger
it
means
to
kill
him
kill
his
body
anyway
while
his
mind
is
somewhere
else
it
means
to
shut
him
out
forever
it
winning
bill
where
are
you
for
christ
sake
where
are
you
and
somewhere
faintly
from
some
unimaginable
distance
he
heard
bill
scream
and
the
words
although
meaningless
were
crystal
clear
and
full
of
sickening
the
turtle
is
dead
oh
god
the
turtle
really
is
dead
despair
bev
shrieked
again
and
put
her
hands
to
her
ears
as
if
to
shut
out
that
fading
voice
the
spider
stinger
rose
and
richie
bolted
at
it
a
grin
spreading
up
toward
his
ears
and
he
called
out
in
his
best
irish
cop
voice
here
here
me
foine
girl
just
what
in
the
hell
do
ye
think
ye're
doin
belay
that
guff
before
i
snatch
yer
pettiskirts
and
snap
yer
smithyriddle
the
spider
stopped
laughing
and
richie
felt
a
rising
howl
of
anger
and
pain
inside
its
head
hurt
it
he
thought
triumphantly
hurt
it
how
about
that
hurt
it
and
guess
what
i've
got
its
tongue
i
think
bill
missed
it
somehow
but
while
it
was
distracted
i
got
then
screaming
at
him
its
cries
a
hive
of
furious
bees
in
his
head
richie
was
whacked
out
of
himself
and
into
darkness
dimly
aware
that
it
was
trying
to
shake
him
loose
it
was
doing
a
pretty
good
job
too
terror
washed
through
him
and
then
was
replaced
by
a
sense
of
cosmic
absurdity
he
remembered
beverly
with
his
duncan
yoyo
showing
him
how
to
make
it
sleep
walk
the
dog
go
around
the
world
and
now
here
he
was
richie
the
human
yoyo
and
its
tongue
was
the
string
here
he
was
and
this
wasn't
called
walking
the
dog
but
maybe
walking
the
spider
and
if
that
wasn't
funny
what
was
richie
laughed
it
wasn't
polite
to
laugh
with
your
mouth
full
of
course
but
he
doubted
if
anybody
out
here
read
miss
manners
that
got
him
laughing
again
and
he
bit
in
harder
the
spider
screamed
and
shook
him
furiously
howling
its
anger
at
being
surprised
again
it
had
believed
only
the
writer
vould
challenge
it
and
now
this
man
who
was
laughing
like
a
crazy
boy
had
seized
it
when
it
was
least
prepared
richie
felt
himself
slipping
hold
eet
a
secon
senhorrita
we
ees
gain
out
here
together
or
i
ain
gonna
sell
you
no
tickets
in
la
lotería
after
all
and
every
one
is
a
big
winner
i
swear
on
my
mamma
name
he
felt
his
teeth
catch
again
more
firmly
this
time
and
there
was
a
fainting
sort
of
pain
as
it
drove
its
fangs
into
his
own
tongue
boy
it
was
still
pretty
funny
though
even
in
the
dark
being
hurled
after
bill
with
only
the
tongue
of
this
unspeakable
monster
left
to
connect
him
to
his
own
world
even
with
the
pain
of
its
poisonous
fangs
suffusing
his
mind
like
a
red
fog
it
was
pretty
goddamned
funny
check
it
out
folks
you'll
believe
a
disc
jockey
can
fly
he
was
flying
all
right
richie
was
in
greater
darkness
than
he
had
ever
known
than
he
had
ever
suspected
might
exist
travelling
at
what
felt
like
the
speed
of
light
and
being
shaken
as
a
terrier
shakes
a
at
he
sensed
that
there
was
something
up
ahead
some
titanic
corpse
the
turtle
he
had
heard
bill
lamenting
in
his
fading
voice
must
be
it
was
only
a
shell
a
dead
husk
then
he
was
past
rushing
on
into
the
darkness
really
steaming
now
he
thought
and
felt
that
wild
urge
to
cackle
again
bill
bill
can
you
hear
me
he
gone
he
in
the
deadlights
let
me
go
let
me

the

bill

now
thank

richie
to
the
rescue
gonna
save
your
old
cracked
ass
owe
you
one
from
that
day
on
neibolt
street
remember
let
me
goooo
it
was
hurting
badly
now
and
richie
understood
how
completely
he
had
caught
it
by
surprise
it
had
believed
it
had
only
bill
to
deal
with
well
good
good
miff
richie
didn't
care
about
killing
it
right
now
he
was
no
longer
sure
it
could
be
killed
but
bill
could
be
killed
and
richie
sensed
that
bill
time
was
now
very
very
short
bill
was
closing
in
on
some
large
nasty
surprise
out
here
something
best
not
thought
about
richie
no
go
back
it
the
edge
of
everything
up
here
the
deadlights
souns
like
what
you
turn
on
when
you
drivinn
you
hearse
at
midnie
senhorr
and
where
is
you
honey
chile
smile
so
i
can
see
where
you
is
and
suddenly
bill
was
there
skidding
along
on
the
left
right
there
was
no
direction
here
one
side
or
the
other
and
beyond
him
coming
up
fast
richie
could
seesense
something
that
finally
dried
up
his
laughter
it
was
a
barrier
something
of
a
strange
non
geometrical
shape
that
his
mind
could
not
grasp
instead
his
mind
translated
it
as
best
it
could
as
it
had
translated
the
shape
of
it
into
a
spider
allowing
richie
to
think
of
it
as
a
colossal
gray
wall
made
of
fossilized
wooden
stakes
these
stakes
went
forever
up
and
forever
down
like
the
bars
of
a
cage
and
from
between
them
shone
a
great
blind
light
it
glared
and
moved
smiled
and
snarled
the
light
was
alive
deadlights
more
than
alive
it
was
full
of
a
force
magnetism
gravity
perhaps
something
else
richie
felt
himself
lifted
and
dropped
swirled
and
pulled
as
if
he
were
shooting
a
fast
throat
of
rapids
in
an
innertube
he
could
feel
the
light
moving
eagerly
over
his
face
and
the
light
was
thinking
this
is
it
this
is
it
the
rest
of
it
let
me
go
you
promised
to
let
me
go
i
know
but
sometimes
honeychile
i
lie
my
mamma
she
beat
me
fo
it
but
my
daddy
he
done
just
about
give
up
he
sensed
bill
tumbling
and
flailing
toward
one
of
the
gaps
in
the
wall
sensed
evil
fingers
of
light
reaching
for
him
and
with
a
final
despairing
effort
he
reached
for
his
friend
bill
your
hand
give
me
your
hand
your
hand
goddammi
your
hand
bill
hand
shot
out
the
fingers
opening
and
closing
that
living
fire
crawling
and
twisting
over
audra
wedding
ring
in
runic
moorish
patterns
wheels
crescents
stars
swastikas
linked
circles
that
grew
into
rolling
chains
bill
face
was
overlaid
with
the
same
light
making
him
look
tattooed
richie
stretched
out
as
far
as
he
could
hearing
it
scream
and
yammer
i
missed
him
oh
dear
god
i
missed
he
going
to
shoot
through
then
bill
fingers
closed
over
richie
and
richie
clenched
his
hand
into
a
fist
bill
legs
flew
through
one
of
the
gaps
in
the
frozen
wood
and
for
one
mad
moment
richie
realized
he
could
see
all
the
bones
and
veins
and
capillaries
inside
them
as
if
bill
had
shot
halfway
into
the
maw
of
the
world
strongest
xray
machine
richie
felt
the
muscles
in
his
arm
stretch
like
taffy
felt
the
ballandsocket
joint
in
his
shoulder
creak
and
groan
in
protest
as
the
foot
pounds
of
pressure
built
up
he
summoned
all
of
his
force
and
shouted
pull
us
back
pull
us
back
or
i'll
kill
you
i
i'll
voice
you
to
death
the
spider
screeched
again
and
richie
suddenly
felt
a
great
snapping
whiplash
curl
through
his
body
his
arm
was
a
whitehot
bar
of
agony
his
grip
on
bill
hand
began
to
slip
hold
on
big
bil
got
you
richie
i
got
yo
you
better
richie
thought
grimly
because
i
think
you
could
walk
ten
billion
miles
out
here
and
never
find
a
fucking
pay
toilet
they
whistled
back
that
crazy
light
fading
becoming
a
sers
of
brilliant
pinpoints
that
finally
winked
out
they
drove
through
the
darkness
like
torpedoes
richie
gripping
its
tongue
with
his
teeth
and
bill
wrist
with
one
aching
hand
there
was
the
turtle
there
and
gone
in
a
single
eyeblink
richie
sensed
them
drawing
closer
to
whatever
passed
for
the
real
world
although
he
believed
he
would
never
think
of
it
as
exactly
real
again
he
would
see
it
as
a
clever
canvas
scene
underlaid
with
a
crisscrossing
of
supportcables
cables
like
the
strands
of
a
spiderweb
but
we're
going
to
be
all
right
he
thought
we're
going
to
get
back
we
the
buffeting
began
then
the
whipping
slamming
sidetoside
flailing
as
it
tried
one
final
time
to
shake
them
off
and
leave
them
outside
and
richie
felt
his
grip
slipping
he
heard
its
guttural
roar
of
triumph
and
concentrated
his
being
on
holding
but
he
continued
to
slip
he
bit
down
frantically
but
its
tongue
seemed
to
be
losing
substance
and
reality
it
seemed
to
be
becoming
gossamer
help
richie
screamed
t'm
losing
it
help
somebody
help
u
eddie
eddie
was
halfaware
of
what
was
happening
he
felt
it
somehow
saw
it
somehow
but
as
if
through
a
gauzy
curtain
somewhere
bill
and
richie
were
struggling
to
come
back
their
bodies
were
here
but
the
rest
of
them
the
real
of
them
was
far
away
he
had
seen
the
spider
tum
to
impale
bill
with
its
stinger
and
then
richie
had
run
forward
yelling
at
it
in
that
ridiculous
irish
cop
voice
he
used
to
use
only
richie
must
have
improved
his
act
a
hell
of
a
lot
over
the
years
because
this
voice
sounded
eerily
like
mr
nell
from
the
old
days
the
spider
had
turned
toward
richie
and
eddie
had
seen
its
unspeakable
red
eyes
bulge
in
their
sockets
richie
yelled
again
this
time
in
his
pancho
vanilla
voice
and
eddie
had
felt
the
spider
scream
in
pain
ben
yelled
hoarsely
as
a
split
appeared
in
its
hide
along
the
line
of
one
of
its
scars
from
the
last
time
a
stream
of
ichor
black
as
crude
oil
sprayed
out
richie
had
started
to
say
something
else
and
his
voice
had
begun
to
diminish
like
the
fade
at
the
end
of
a
pop
song
his
head
had
rolled
back
on
his
neck
his
eyes
fixed
on
its
eyes
the
spider
grew
quiet
again
time
passed
eddie
had
no
idea
just
how
much
richie
and
the
spider
stared
at
each
other
eddie
sensed
the
connection
between
them
felt
a
swirl
of
talk
and
emotion
somewhere
far
away
he
could
make
out
nothing
exactly
but
sensed
the
tones
of
things
in
colors
and
hues
bill
lay
slumped
on
the
floor
nose
and
ears
bleeding
fingers
twitching
slightly
his
long
face
pale
his
eyes
closed
the
spider
was
now
bleeding
in
four
or
five
places
badly
hurt
again
badly
hurt
but
still
dangerously
vital
and
eddie
thought
why
are
we
just
standing
around
here
we
could
hurt
it
while
it
occupied
with
richie
why
doesn't
somebody
move
for
christ
sake
he
sensed
a
wild
triumph
and
that
feeling
was
dearer
sharper
closer
they're
coming
back
he
wanted
to
shout
but
his
mouth
was
too
dry
his
throat
too
tight
they're
coming
back
then
richie
head
began
to
turn
slowly
from
side
to
side
his
body
seemed
to
ripple
inside
his
clothes
his
glasses
hung
on
the
end
of
his
nose
for
a
moment
then
fell
off
and
shattered
on
the
stone
floor
the
spider
stirred
its
spiny
legs
making
a
dry
clittering
on
the
floor
eddie
heard
it
cry
out
in
terrible
triumph
and
a
moment
later
richie
voice
burst
clearly
into
his
head
help
i'm
losing
it
somebody
help
me}
eddie
ran
forward
then
yanking
his
aspirator
from
his
pocket
with
his
good
hand
his
lips
drawn
back
in
a
grimace
his
breath
whistling
painfully
in
and
out
of
a
throat
that
now
felt
the
size
of
a
pinhole
crazily
his
mother
face
danced
before
him
and
she
was
crying
don't
go
near
that
thing
eddie
don't
go
near
it
things
like
that
give
you
cancer
shut
up
ma
eddie
screamed
in
a
high
shrieky
voice
all
the
voice
he
had
left
the
spider
head
turned
toward
the
sound
its
eyes
momentarily
leaving
richie
her
eddie
howled
in
his
fading
voice
here
have
some
of
thi
he
leaped
at
it
triggering
the
aspirator
at
the
same
time
and
for
an
instant
all
his
childhood
belief
in
the
medicine
came
back
to
him
the
childhood
medicine
that
could
solve
everything
that
could
make
him
feel
better
when
the
bigger
boys
roughed
him
up
or
when
he
was
knocked
over
in
the
rush
to
get
through
the
doors
when
school
let
out
or
when
he
had
to
sit
on
the
edge
of
the
tracker
brothers
vacant
lot
out
of
the
game
because
his
mother
wouldn't
allow
him
to
play
baseball
it
was
good
medicine
strong
medicine
and
as
he
leaped
into
the
spider
face
smelling
its
foul
yellow
stench
feeling
himself
overwhelmed
by
its
singleminded
fury
and
determination
to
wipe
them
all
out
he
triggered
the
aspirator
into
one
of
its
ruby
eyes
he
feltheard
its
scream
no
rage
this
time
only
pain
a
horrid
screaming
agony
he
saw
the
mist
of
droplets
settle
on
that
bloodred
bulge
saw
the
droplets
turn
white
where
they
landed
saw
them
sink
in
as
a
splash
of
carbolic
acid
would
sink
in
he
saw
its
huge
eye
begin
to
flatten
out
like
a
bloody
eggyolk
and
run
in
a
ghastly
stream
of
living
blood
and
ichor
and
maggoty
pus
come
home
now
bil
he
screamed
with
the
last
of
his
voice
and
then
he
struck
it
he
felt
its
noisome
heat
baking
into
him
he
felt
a
terrible
wet
warmth
and
realized
that
his
good
arm
had
slipped
into
the
spider
mouth
he
triggered
the
aspirator
again
shooting
the
stuff
right
down
its
throat
this
tune
right
down
its
rotten
evil
stinking
gullet
and
there
was
sudden
flashing
pain
as
clean
as
the
drop
of
a
heavy
knife
as
its
jaws
closed
and
ripped
his
arm
off
at
the
shoulder
eddie
fell
to
the
floor
the
ragged
stump
of
his
arm
spraying
blood
faintly
aware
that
bill
was
getting
shakily
to
his
feet
that
richie
was
weaving
and
stumbling
toward
him
like
a
drunk
at
the
end
of
a
long
hard
night
eds
far
away
unimportant
he
could
feel
everything
running
out
of
him
along
with
his
life
blood
all
the
rage
all
the
pain
all
the
fear
all
the
confusion
and
hurt
he
supposed
he
was
dying
but
he
felt
ah
god
he
felt
so
lucid
so
clear
like
a
windowpane
which
has
been
washed
clean
and
now
lets
in
all
the
gloriously
frightening
light
of
some
unsuspected
dawning
the
light
oh
god
that
perfect
rational
light
that
clears
the
horizon
somewhere
in
the
world
every
second
eds
oh
my
god
bill
ben
someone
he
lost
his
arm
his
he
looked
up
at
beverly
and
saw
she
was
crying
the
tears
coursing
down
her
dirty
cheeks
as
she
got
an
arm
under
him
he
became
aware
that
she
had
taken
off
her
blouse
and
was
trying
to
staunch
the
flow
of
blood
and
that
she
was
screaming
for
help
then
he
looked
at
richie
and
licked
his
lips
fading
fading
back
becoming
clearer
and
clearer
emptying
out
all
of
the
impurities
flowing
out
of
him
so
he
could
become
clear
so
that
the
light
could
flow
through
and
if
he
had
had
time
enough
he
could
have
preached
on
this
he
could
have
sermonized
not
bad
he
would
begin
this
is
not
bad
at
all
but
there
was
something
else
he
had
to
say
first
richie
he
whispered
what
richie
was
down
on
his
hands
and
knees
staring
at
him
desperately
don't
call
me
ed
he
said
and
smiled
he
raised
his
left
hand
slowly
and
touched
richie
cheek
richie
was
crying
you
know
i...i
eddie
closed
his
eyes
thinking
how
to
finish
and
while
he
was
still
thinking
it
over
he
died

harry
brooks
a
national
weather
service
forecaster
based
at
bangor
international
airport
made
an
alarmed
call
to
nws
headquarters
in
augusta
the
winds
he
said
were
coming
out
of
the
west
and
blowing
in
a
queer
semicircular
pattern
he
had
never
seen
before
but
it
looked
to
him
more
and
more
like
some
weird
species
of
pocket
hurricane
one
that
was
limited
almost
exclusively
to
derry
township
at
the
major
bangor
radio
stations
broadcast
the
first
severe
weather
warnings
the
explosion
of

killed
the

over

kansas
street

of
the
barrens
at
a
hoary
old
maple
on
the
old
cape

of
the
barrens
fell
with
a
terrific
rending
crash
flattening
a
niteowl
store
on
the
corner
of
merit
street
and
cape
avenue
an
elderly
patron
named
raymond
fogarty
was
killed
by
a
toppling
beer
cooler
this
was
the
same
raymond
fogarty
who
as
the
minister
of
the
first
methodist
church
of
derry
had
presided
over
the
burial

of

more
fashionable

chimed
neither
six

three
minutes
after

fell
in
the
old
cape
and
about
an
hour
and
fifteen
minutes
after
every
toilet
and
domestic
drain
over
there
had
suddenly
reversed
itself
the
clock
in
the
tower
chimed
thirteen
times
a
minute
later
a
bluewhite
stroke
of
lightning
struck
the
steeple

the
minister
wife
happened
to
be
looking
out
the
window
of
the
parsonage
kitchen
at
the
time
and
she
said
that
the
steeple
exploded
like
someone
loaded
it
up
with
dynamite
whitewashed
boards
chunks
of
beams
and
clockwork
from
switzerland
showered
down
on
the
street
the
ragged
remains
of
the
steeple
burned
briefly
and
then
guttered
out
in
the
rain

was
now
a
tropical
downpour
the
streets
leading
downhill
into
the
downtown
shopping
area
foamed
and
ran
the
progress
of
the
canal
under

street
had
become
a
steady
shaking
thunder
that
made
people
look
at
each
other
uneasily
at
with
the
titanic
crash
of
the
grace
baptist
steeple
still
reverberating
all
over

the
janitor
who
came
into
wally
spa
every
morning
except
sunday
to
swamp
the
place
out
saw
something
which
sent
him
screaming
into
the
street
this
fellow
who
had
been
an
alcoholic
ever
since
his
first
semester
at
the
university
of
maine
to
these
eleven
years
ago
was
paid
a
pittance
for
his
services
his
real
pay
it
was
understood
was
his
absolute
freedom
to
finish
up
anything
left
in
the
beer
kegs
under
the
bar
from
the
night
before
richie
tozier
might
or
might
not
have
remembered
him
he
was
vincent
caruso
taliendo
better
known
to
his
fifth
grade
contemporaries
as
booger
taliendo
as
he
was
mopping
up
on
that
apocalyptic
moming
in
derry
working
his
way
gradually
closer
and
doser
to
the
serving
area
he
saw
all
seven
of
the
beer
taps
three
bud
two
narragansett
one
schlitz
known
more
familiarly
to
the
bleary
patrons
of
wally
as
slits
and
one
miller
lite
nod
forward
as
if
pulled
by
seven
invisible
hands
beer
ran
from
them
in
streams
of
goldwhite
foam
vince
started
forward
thinking
not
of
ghosts
or
phantoms
but
of
his
morning
dividend
going
down
the
drain
then
he
skidded
to
a
stop
eyes
widening
and
a
wailing
horrified
scream
rose
in
the
empty
beersmelling
cave
that
was
wally
spa
beer
had
given
way
to
arterial
streams
of
blood
it
swirled
in
the
chromium
drains
overflowed
and
ran
down
the
side
of
the
bar
in
little
streamlets
now
hair
and
chunks
of
flesh
began
to
splurt
out
of
the
beertaps
booger
taliendo
watched
this
transfixed
not
even
able
to
summon
enough
strength
to
scream
again
then
there
was
a
thudding
toneless
blast
as
one
of
the
beer
kegs
under
the
counter
exploded
all
of
the
cupboard
doors
under
the
bar
swung
wide
greenish
smoke
like
the
aftermath
of
a
magician
trick
began
to
drift
out
of
them
booger
had
seen
enough
screaming
he
fled
into
the
street
which
was
now
a
shallow
canal
he
fell
on
his
butt
got
up
and
threw
a
terrified
glance
back
over
his
shoulder
one
of
the
bar
windows
blew
out
with
a
loud
shooting
gallery
sound
whickers
of
broken
glass
whistled
all
around
vince
head
a
moment
later
the
other
window
exploded
once
again
he
was
miraculously
untouched
but
he
decided
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
that
the
time
had
come
to
see
his
sister
up
eastport
he
started
off
at
once
and
his
journey
to
the
derry
town
limits
and
beyond
would
make
a
saga
in
itself
but
suffice
it
to
say
that
he
did
eventually
get
out
of
town
others
were
not
so
lucky
aloysius
nell
who
had
turned
seventyseven
not
long
since
was
sitting
with
his
wife
in
the
parlor
of
their
home
on
strapham
street
watching
the
storm
pound
derry
at
he
suffered
a
fatal
stroke
his
wife
told
her
brother
a
week
later
that
aloysius
dropped
his
coffee
cup
on
the
rug
sat
boltupright
his
eyes
wide
and
staring
and
screamed
here
here
me
foine
girl
just
what
in
the
hell
do
ye
think
ye're
doin
belay
that
guff
before
i
snatch
yer
pettiskinr
then
he
fell
out
of
his
chair
smashing
his
coffee
cup
under
him
maureen
nell
who
knew
well
how
bad
his
ticker
had
been
for
the
last
three
years
understood
immediately
that
all
was
over
with
him
and
after
loosening
his
collar
she
had
run
for
the
telephone
to
call
father
mcdowell
but
the
phone
was
out
of
order
a
funny
noise
like
a
police
siren
was
all
it
would
make
and
so
although
she
knew
it
was
probably
a
blasphemy
she
would
have
to
answer
for
to
saint
peter
she
had
attempted
to
give
him
the
last
rites
herself
she
felt
confident
she
told
her
brother
that
god
would
understand
even
if
saint
peter
didn't
aloysius
had
been
a
good
husband
and
a
good
man
and
if
he
drank
too
much
that
was
only
the
irish
in
him
coming
out
at
a
series
of
explosions
shook
the
derry
mall
which
stood
on
the
site
of
the
defunct
kitchener
ironworks
no
one
was
killed
the
mall
didn't
open
until
and
the
fiveman
janitorial
squad
hadn't
been
due
to
arrive
until
and
on
such
a
morning
as
this
very
few
of
them
would
have
shown
up
anyway
a
team
of
investigators
later
dismissed
the
idea
of
sabotage
they
suggested
rather
vaguely
that
the
explosions
had
probably
been
caused
by
water
which
had
seeped
into
the
mall
electrical
system
whatever
the
reason
no
one
was
going
to
go
shopping
at
the
derry
mall
for
a
long
time
one
explosion
totally
wiped
out
zale

diamond

bracelets
strings
of
pearls
trays
of

rings
and
seiko
digital
watches
flew
everywhere
in
a
hail
of
bright
sparkly
trinkets
a
musicbox
flew
the
length
of
the
east
corridor
and
landed
in
the
fountain
outside
of
the
j
c
penney
where
it
briefly
played
a
bubbly
rendition
of
the
theme
from
love
story
before
shutting
down
the
same
blast
tore
a
hole
through
the
baskin
robbins
next
door
turning
the
thirtyone
flavors
into
icecream
soup
that
ran
away
along
the
floor
in
cloudy
runnels
the
blast
which
tore
through
sears
lifted
off
a
chunk
of
the
roof
and
the
rising
wind
sailed
it
away
like
a
kite
it
came
down
a
thousand
yards
away
slicing
cleanly
through
the
silo
of
a
farmer
named
brent
kilgallon
kilgallon
sixteenyearold
son
rushed
out
with
his
mother
kodak
and
took
a
picture
the
national
enquirer
bought
it
for
sixty
dollars
which
the
boy
used
to
buy
two
new
tires
for
his
yamaha
motorcycle
a
third
explosion
ripped
through
hit
or
miss
sending
flaming
skirts
jeans
and
underwear
out
into
the
flooded
parkinglot
and
a
final
explosion
tore
open
the
mall
branch
of
the
derry
farmer
trust
like
a
rotted
box
of
crackers
a
chunk
of
the
bank
roof
was
also
torn
off
burglar
alarms
went
off
with
a
bray
that
would
not
be
silenced
until
the
security
system
independent
wiring
hookup
was
shorted
out
four
hours
later
loan
contracts
banking
instruments
deposit
slips
cashdrawer
chits
and
moneymanager
forms
were
lifted
into
the
sky
and
blown
away
by

and

tens
and

mostly
with
a
generous
helping
of
fives
and
a
soupcon
of
fifties
and
hundreds
better
than

blew
away
according
to
the
bank
officers
later
after
a
mass
shakeup
in
the
bank
executive
structure
and
an
fslic
bailout
some
would
admit
strictly
off
the
record
of
course
that
it
had
been
more
like
$
a
woman
in
haven
village
named
rebecca
paulson
found
a
fiftydollar
bill
fluttering
from
her
backdoor
welcome
mat
two
twenties
in
her
bird
house
and
a
hundred
plastered
against
an
oak
tree
in
her
back
yard
she
and
her
husband
used
the
money
to
make
an
extra
two
payments
on
their
bombardier
skidoo
dr
hale
a
retired
doctor
who
had
lived
on
west
broadway
for
nearly
fifty
years
was
killed
at
a.m
dr
hale
liked
to
boast
that
he
had
taken
the
same
twomile
walk
from
his
west
broadway
home
and
around
derry
park
and
the
elementary
school
for
the
last
twentyfive
of
those
fifty
years
nothing
stopped
him
not
rain
sleet
hail
howling
nor'easters
or
subzero
cold
he
set
out
on
the
morning
of
may
st
in
spite
of
his
housekeeper
worried
fussings
his
exitline
from
the
world
spoken
back
over
his
shoulder
as
he
went
through
the
front
door
pulling
his
hat
firmly
down
to
his
ears
was
don't
be
so
goddamned
silly
hilda
this
is
nothing
but
a
capful
of
rain
you
should
have
seen
it
in
that
was
a
stor
as
dr
hale
turned
back
onto
west
broadway
a
manhole
cover
in
front
of
the
mueller
place
suddenly
lifted
off
like
the
pay
load
of
a
redstone
rocket
it
decapitated
the
good
doctor
so
quickly
and
neatly
that
he
walked
on
another
three
steps
before
collapsing
dead
on
the
sidewalk
and
the
wind
continued
to
rise
under
the
city
/
p.m
eddie
led
them
through
the
darkened
tunnels
for
an
hour
perhaps
an
hour
and
a
half
before
admitting
in
a
tone
that
was
more
bewildered
than
frightened
that
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
was
lost
they
could
still
hear
the
dim
thunder
of
water
in
the
drains
but
the
acoustics
of
all
of
these
tunnels
was
so
crazed
that
it
was
impossible
to
tell
if
the
watersounds
were
coming
from
ahead
or
behind
left
or
right
above
or
below
their
matches
were
gone
they
were
lost
in
the
dark
bill
was
scared
plenty
scared
the
conversation
he'd
had
with
his
father
in
his
father
shop
kept
coming
back
to
him
there
nine
pounds
of
blueprints
that
just
disappeared
somewhere
along
the
line
my
point
is
that
nobody
knows
where
all
the
damned
sewers
and
drains
go
or
why
when
they
work
nobody
cares
when
they
don't
there
three
or
four
sad
sacks
from
derry
water
who
have
to
try
and
find
out
which
pump
went
flooey
or
where
the
plugup
is
it
dark
and
smelly
and
there
are
rats
those
are
dl
good
reasons
to
stay
out
but
the
best
reason
is
that
you
could
get
lost
it
happened
before
happened
before
happened
before
it
happened
sure
it
had
there
was
that
bundle
of
bones
and
polished
cotton
they
had
passed
on
the
way
to
its
lair
for
instance
bill
felt
panic
trying
to
rise
and
pushed
it
back
it
went
but
not
easily
he
could
feel
it
back
there
a
live
thing
struggling
and
twisting
trying
to
get
out
adding
to
it
was
the
nagging
unanswerable
question
of
whether
they
had
killed
it
or
not
richie
said
yes
mike
said
yes
so
did
eddie
but
he
hadn't
liked
the
frightened
doubtful
look
on
bev
face
or
on
stan
as
the
light
died
and
they
crawled
back
through
the
small
door
away
from
the
susurating
collapsing
web
so
what
do
we
do
now
stan
asked
bill
heard
the
frightened
littleboy
tremble
in
stan
voice
and
knew
the
question
was
aimed
directly
at
him
yea
ben
said
what
damn
i
wish
we
had
a
flashlight
or
even
a
can
candle
bill
thought
he
heard
a
stifled
sob
in
the
second
ellipsis
it
frightened
him
more
than
anything
else
ben
would
have
been
astounded
to
know
it
but
bill
thought
the
fat
boy
tough
and
resourceful
steadier
than
richie
and
less
apt
to
cave
in
suddenly
than
stan
if
ben
was
getting
ready
to
crack
they
were
on
the
edge
of
very
bad
trouble
it
was
not
the
skeleton
of
the
water
department
guy
to
which
bill
own
mind
kept
returning
but
to
tom
sawyer
and
becky
thatcher
lost
in
mcdougal
cave
he
would
push
the
thought
away
and
then
it
would
come
stealing
back
something
else
was
troubling
him
but
the
concept
was
too
large
and
too
vague
for
his
tired
boy
mind
to
grasp
perhaps
it
was
the
very
simplicity
of
the
idea
that
made
it
elusive
they
were
falling
away
from
each
other
the
bond
that
had
held
them
all
this
long
summer
was
dissolving
it
had
been
faced
and
vanquished
it
might
be
dead
as
richie
and
eddie
thought
or
it
might
be
wounded
so
badly
it
would
sleep
for
a
hundred
years
or
a
thousand
or
ten
thousand
they
had
faced
it
seen
it
with
its
final
mask
laid
aside
and
it
had
been
horrible
enough
oh
for
sure
but
once
seen
its
physical
form
was
not
so
bad
and
its
most
potent
weapon
was
taken
away
from
it
they
all
had
after
all
seen
spiders
before
they
were
alien
and
somehow
crawlingly
dreadful
and
he
supposed
that
none
of
them
would
ever
be
able
to
see
another
one
if
we
ever
get
out
of
this
without
feeling
a
shudder
of
revulsion
but
a
spider
was
after
all
only
a
spider
perhaps
at
the
end
when
the
masks
of
horror
were
laid
aside
there
was
nothing
with
which
the
human
mind
could
not
cope
that
was
a
heartening
thought
anything
except
the
deadlights
whatever
had
been
out
there
but
perhaps
even
that
unspeakable
living
light
which
crouched
at
the
doorway
to
the
macroverse
was
dead
or
dying
the
deadlights
and
the
trip
into
the
black
to
the
place
where
they
had
been
was
already
growing
hazy
and
hard
to
recall
in
his
mind
and
that
wasn't
really
the
point
the
point
felt
but
not
grasped
was
simply
that
the
fellowship
was
ending
it
was
ending
and
they
were
still
in
the
dark
that
other
had
through
their
friendship
perhaps
been
able
to
make
them
something
more
than
children
but
they
were
becoming
children
again
bill
felt
as
much
as
the
others
what
now
bill
richie
asked
finally
saying
it
right
out
i
dddon't
nuhnuhkno
bill
said
his
stutter
was
back
alive
and
well
he
heard
it
they
heard
it
and
he
stood
in
the
dark
smelling
the
sodden
aroma
of
their
growing
panic
wondering
how
long
it
would
be
before
somebody
stan
most
likely
it
would
be
stan
tore
things
wide
open
by
saying
well
why
don't
you
know
you
got
us
into
this
and
what
about
henry
mike
asked
uneasily
is
he
still
out
there
or
what
oh
jeez
eddie
said
almost
moaned
i
forgot
about
him
sure
he
is
sure
he
is
he
probably
as
lost
as
we
are
and
we
could
run
into
him
any
time
jeez
bill
don't
you
have
any
ideas
your
dad
works
down
here
don't
you
have
any
ideas
at
all
bill
listened
to
the
distant
mocking
thunder
of
the
water
and
tried
to
have
the
idea
that
eddie
all
of
them
had
a
right
to
demand
because
yes
correct
he
had
gotten
them
into
this
and
it
was
his
responsibility
to
get
them
back
out
again
nothing
came
nothing
i
have
an
ide
beverly
said
quietly
in
the
dark
bill
heard
a
sound
he
could
not
immediately
place
a
whispery
little
sound
but
not
scary
then
there
was
a
more
easily
placed
sound
a
zipper
what
he
thought
and
then
he
realized
what
she
was
undressing
for
some
reason
beverly
was
undressing
what
are
you
doing
richie
asked
and
his
shocked
voice
cracked
on
the
last
word
know
something
beverly
said
in
the
dark
and
to
bill
her
voice
sounded
older
i
know
because
my
father
told
me
i
know
how
to
bring
us
back
together
and
if
we're
not
together
we'll
never
get
out
what
ben
asked
sounding
bewildered
and
terrified
what
are
you
talking
about
something
that
will
bring
us
together
forever
something
that
will
show
nuhnuhno
bb
beverly
bill
said
suddenly
understanding
understanding
everything
that
will
show
that
i
love
you
all
beverly
said
that
you're
all
my
friends
what
she
mike
began
calmly
beverly
cut
across
his
words
who
first
she
asked
think
in
the
lair
of
it/
he
dying
beverly
wept
his
arm
it
ate
his
arm
she
reached
for
bill
clung
to
him
and
bill
shook
her
off
tt
getting
avay
again
he
roared
at
her
blood
caked
his
lips
and
chin
cuhcuhcome
on
richie
bbben
this
tuhtime
we're
gggoing
to
fuhhinish
her
richie
turned
bill
toward
him
looked
at
him
as
you
would
look
at
a
man
who
is
hopelessly
raving
bill
ve
have
to
take
care
of
eddie
we
have
to
get
a
tourniquet
on
him
get
him
out
of
here
but
beverly
was
now
sitting
with
eddie
head
in
her
lap
cradling
him
she
had
closed
his
eyes
go
with
bill
she
said
if
you
let
him
die
for
nothing
if
it
comes
back
in
another
twentyfive
years
or
fifty
or
even
two
thousand
i

i'll
i'll
haunt

ghosts
g
richie
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
indecisive
then
he
became
aware
that
her
face
was
losing
definition
becoming
not
a
face
but
a
pale
shape
in
the
growing
shadows
the
light
was
fading
it
decided
him
all
righ
he
said
to
bill
this
time
we
chase
ben
was
standing
in
back
of
the
spiderweb
which
had
begun
to
decay
again
he
had
also
seen
the
shape
swaying
high
up
in
it
and
he
prayed
that
bill
would
not
look
up
but
as
the
web
began
to
fall
in
drifts
and
strands
and
skeins
bill
did
he
saw
audra
sagging
as
if
in
a
very
old
and
creaky
elevator
she
dropped
ten
feet
stopped
swaying
from
side
to
side
and
then
abruptly
dropped
another
fifteen
her
face
never
changed
her
eyes
chinablue
were
wide
open
her
bare
feet
swung
back
and
forth
like
pendulums
her
hair
hung
lankly
over
her
shoulders
her
mouth
was
ajar
audra
he
screamed
bill
come
o
ben
shouted
the
web
was
falling
all
around
them
now
thudding
to
the
floor
and
beginning
to
run
richie
suddenly
grabbed
bill
around
the
waist
and
propelled
him
forward
shooting
for
a
ten
foothigh
gap
between
the
floor
and
the
bottommost
crossstrand
of
the
sagging
web
go
bill
go
go
that
audra
bill
shouted
desperately
thuhthat
audr
don't
give
a
shit
if
it
the
pope
richie
said
grimly
eddie
dead
and
we're
going
to
kill
it
if
it
still
alive
we're
going
to
finish
the
job
this
time
big
bill
either
she
alive
or
she
not
now
come
on
bill
hung
back
a
moment
longer
and
then
snapshots
of
the
children
all
the
dead
children
seemed
to
flutter
through
his
mind
like
lost
photographs
from
george
album
school
friends
aa
ruhright
let
œ
go
guhguhgod
forgive
mme
he
and
richie
ran
under
the
strand
of
crosswebbing
seconds
before
it
collapsed
and
joined
ben
on
the
other
side
they
ran
after
it
as
audra
swung
and
dangled
fifty
feet
above
the
stone
floor
wrapped
in
a
numbing
cocoon
that
was
attached
to
the
decaying
web
ben
they
followed
the
trail
of
its
black
blood
oily
pools
of
ichor
that
ran
and
dripped
into
the
cracks
between
the
flagstones
but
as
the
floor
began
to
rise
toward
a
semicircular
black
opening
at
the
far
side
of
the
chamber
ben
saw
something
new
a
trail
of
eggs
each
was
black
and
roughshelled
perhaps
as
big
as
an
ostrichegg
a
waxy
light
shone
from
within
them
ben
realized
they
were
semitransparent
he
could
see
black
shapes
moving
inside
its
children
he
thought
and
felt
his
gorge
rise
its
miscarried
children
god
god
richie
and
bill
had
stopped
and
were
staring
at
the
eggs
with
stupid
dazed
wonder
go
on
go
on
ben
shouted
ti
take
care
of
them
get
it
here
richie
shouted
and
threw
ben
a
pack
of
derry
town
house
matches
ben
caught
them
bill
and
richie
ran
on
ben
watched
them
in
the
rapidly
dimming
light
for
a
moment
they
ran
into
the
darkness
of
its
escapepassage
and
were
bst
from
sight
then
he
looked
down
at
the
first
of
the
thinshelled
eggs
at
the
black
mantalike
shadow
inside
and
felt
his
determination
waver
this
hey
guys
this
was
too
much
this
was
simply
too
awful
and
surely
they
would
die
without
his
help
they
had
not
been
so
much
laid
as
dropped
but
it
time
was
close
and
if
one
of
them
is
capable
of
surviving
even
one
summoning
all
of
his
courage
summoning
up
eddie
pale
dying
face
ben
brought
one
desert
driver
boot
down
on
the
first
egg
it
broke
with
a
sodden
squelch
as
some
stinking
placenta
ran
out
around
his
boot
then
a
spider
the
size
of
a
rat
was
scrabbling
weakly
across
the
floor
trying
to
get
away
and
ben
could
hear
it
in
his
head
its
high
mewling
cries
like
the
sound
of
a
handsaw
being
bent
rapidly
back
and
forth
so
that
it
makes
ghost
music
ben
lurched
after
it
on
legs
that
felt
like
stilts
and
brought
his
foot
down
again
he
felt
the
spider
body
crunch
and
splatter
under
the
heel
of
his
boot
his
gorge
clenched
and
this
time
there
was
no
way
he
could
hold
back
he
vomited
then
twisted
his
heel
grinding
the
thing
into
the
stones
listening
to
the
cries
in
his
head
fade
to
nothing
how
many
how
many
eggs
didn't
i
read
somewhere
that
spiders
can
lay
thousands
or
millions
i
can't
keep
doing
this
i'll
go
mad
you
have
to
you
have
to
come
on
ben
get
it
together
he
went
to
the
next
egg
and
repeated
the
process
in
the
last
of
the
dying
lieht
everything
was
repeated
the
brittle
snap
the
squelch
of
liquid
the
final
coup
de
grâce
the
next
the
next
the
next
making
his
way
slowly
toward
the
black
arch
into
which
his
friends
had
gone
the
darkness
was
complete
now
beverly
and
the
decaying
web
somewhere
behind
him
he
could
still
hear
the
whisper
of
its
collapse
the
eggs
were
pallid
stones
in
the
dark
as
he
reached
each
one
he
struck
a
light
from
the
matchbook
and
broke
it
open
in
each
case
he
was
able
to
follow
the
course
of
the
dazed
spiderling
and
crush
it
before
the
light
flickered
out
he
had
no
idea
how
he
was
going
to
proceed
if
his
matches
gave
out
before
he
had
crushed
the
last
of
the
eggs
and
killed
each
one
unspeakable
cargo
it
/
still
coming
it
sensed
them
still
coming
gaining
and
its
fear
grew
perhaps
it
was
not
eternal
after
all
the
unthinkable
must
finally
be
thought
worse
it
sensed
the
death
of
its
young
a
third
of
these
hated
hateful
men
boys
was
walking
steadily
up
its
trail
of
birth
almost
insane
with
revulsion
but
continuing
nonetheless
methodically
stamping
the
life
from
each
of
its
eggs
no
it
wailed
lurching
from
side
to
side
feeling
its
lifeforce
running
from
a
hundred
wounds
none
of
them
mortal
in
itself
but
each
a
song
of
pain
each
slowing
it
one
of
its
legs
hung
by
a
single
living
twist
of
meat
one
of
its
eyes
was
blind
it
sensed
a
terrible
rupture
inside
the
result
of
whatever
poison
one
of
the
hated
menboys
had
managed
to
shoot
down
its
throat
and
still
they
came
on
closing
the
distance
and
how
could
this
happen
it
whined
and
mewled
and
when
it
sensed
them
almost
directly
behind
it
did
the
only
thing
it
could
do
now
it
turned
to
fight
beverly
before
the
last
of
the
light
faded
and
utter
dark
closed
down
she
saw
bill
wife
plunge
another
twenty
feet
and
then
fetch
up
again
she
had
begun
to
spin
her
long
red
hair
fanning
out
his
wife
she
thought
but
i
was
his
first
love
and
if
he
thought
some
other
woman
was
his
first
it
was
only
because
he
forgot
forgot
derry
then
she
was
in
darkness
alone
with
the
sound
of
the
falling
web
and
eddie
simple
moveless
weight
she
didn't
want
to
let
him
go
didn't
want
to
let
his
face
lie
on
the
foul
floor
of
this
place
so
she
held
his
head
in
the
crook
of
an
arm
that
had
gone
mostly
numb
and
brushed
his
hair
away
from
his
damp
forehead
she
thought
of
the
birds
that
was
something
she
supposed
she
had
gotten
from
stan
poor
stan
who
hadn't
been
able
to
face
this
all
of
them
i
was
their
first
love
she
tried
to
remember
it
it
was
something
good
to
think
about
in
all
this
darkness
where
you
couldn't
place
the
sounds
it
made
her
feel
less
alone
at
first
it
wouldn't
come
the
image
of
the
birds
intervened
crows
and
grackles
and
starlings
spring
birds
that
came
back
from
somewhere
while
the
streets
were
still
running
with
meltwater
and
the
last
patches
of
crusted
dirty
snow
clung
grimly
to
their
shady
places
it
seemed
to
her
that
it
was
always
on
a
cloudy
day
that
you
first
heard
and
saw
those
spring
birds
and
wondered
where
they
came
from
suddenly
they
were
just
back
in
derry
filling
the
white
air
with
their
raucous
chatter
they
lined
the
telephone
wires
and
roofpeaks
of
the
victorian
houses
on
west
broadway
they
jostled
for
places
on
the
aluminum
branches
of
the
elaborate
tv
antenna
on
top
of
wally
spa
they
loaded
the
wet
black
branches
of
the
elms
on
lower
main
street
they
settled
they
talked
to
each
other
in
the
screamy
babbling
voices
of
old
countrywomen
at
the
weekly
grange
bingo
games
and
then
at
some
signal
which
humans
could
not
discern
they
all
took
wing
at
once
turning
the
sky
black
with
their
numbers
and
came
down
somewhere
else
yes
the
birds
i
was
thinking
of
them
because
i
was
ashamed
it
was
my
father
who
made
me
ashamed
i
guess
and
maybe
that
was
it
doing
too
maybe
the
memory
came
the
memory
behind
the
birds
but
it
was
vague
and
disconnected
perhaps
this
one
always
would
be
she
had
her
thoughts
broke
off
as
she
realized
that
eddie
love
and
desire
/
august
th
comes
to
her
first
because
he
is
the
most
frightened
he
comes
to
her
not
as
her
friend
of
that
summer
or
as
her
brief
lover
now
but
the
way
he
would
have
come
to
his
mother
only
three
or
four
years
ago
to
be
comforted
he
doesn't
draw
back
from
her
smooth
nakedness
and
at
first
she
doubts
if
he
even
feels
it
he
is
trembling
and
although
she
holds
him
the
darkness
is
so
perfect
that
even
this
close
she
cannot
see
him
except
for
the
rough
cast
he
might
as
well
be
a
phantom
what
do
you
want
he
asks
her
you
have
to
put
your
thing
in
me
she
says
he
tries
to
pull
back
but
she
holds
him
and
he
subsides
against
her
she
has
heard
someone
ben
she
thinks
draw
in
his
breath
bevvie
i
can't
do
that
i
don't
know
how
think
it
easy
but
you'll
have
to
get
undressed
she
thinks
about
the
intricacies
of
managing
cast
and
shirt
first
somehow
separating
and
then
rejoining
them
and
amends
your
pants
anyway
no
i
can't
but
she
thinks
part
of
him
can
and
wants
to
because
his
trembling
has
stopped
and
she
feels
something
small
and
hard
which
presses
against
the
right
side
of
her
belly
you
ca
she
says
and
pulls
him
down
the
surface
beneath
her
bare
back
and
legs
is
firm
clayey
dry
the
distant
thunder
of
the
water
is
drowsy
soothing
she
reaches
for
him
there
a
moment
when
her
father
face
intervenes
harsh
and
forbidding
i
want
to
see
if
you're
intact
and
then
she
closes
her
arms
around
eddie
neck
her
smooth
cheek
against
his
smooth
cheek
and
as
he
tentatively
touches
her
small
breasts
she
sighs
and
thinks
for
the
first
time
this
is
eddie
and
she
remembers
a
day
in
july
could
it
only
have
been
last
month
when
no
one
else
turned
up
in
the
barrens
but
eddie
and
he
had
a
whole
bunch
of
little
lulu
comic
books
and
they
read
together
for
most
of
the
afternoon
little
lulu
looking
for
beebleberries
and
getting
in
all
sorts
of
crazy
situations
witch
hazel
all
of
those
guys
it
had
been
fun
she
thinks
of
birds
in
particular
of
the
grackles
and
starlings
and
crows
that
come
back
in
the
spring
and
her
hands
go
to
his
belt
and
loosen
it
and
he
says
again
that
he
can't
do
that
she
tells
him
that
he
can
she
knows
he
can
and
what
she
feels
is
not
shame
or
fear
now
but
a
kind
of
triumph
where
'
he
says
and
that
hard
thing
pushes
urgently
against
her
inner
thigh
her
she
says
bevvie
i'll
fall
on
yo
he
says
and
she
hears
his
breath
start
to
whistle
painfully
think
that
sort
of
the
idea
she
tells
him
and
holds
him
gently
and
guides
him
he
pushes
forward
too
fast
and
there
is
pain
ssssss
she
draws
her
breath
in
her
teeth
biting
at
her
lower
lip
and
thinks
of
the
birds
again
the
spring
birds
lining
the
roofpeaks
of
houses
taking
wing
all
at
once
under
low
march
clouds
beverly
he
says
uncertainly
are
you
oka
go
slowe
she
says
it'll
be
easier
for
you
to
breathe
he
does
move
more
slowly
and
after
awhile
his
breathing
speeds
up
but
she
understands
this
is
not
because
there
is
anything
wrong
with
him
the
pain
fades
suddenly
he
moves
more
quickly
then
stops
stiffens
and
makes
a
sound
some
sound
she
senses
that
this
is
something
for
him
something
extraordinarily
special
something
like
like
flying
she
feels
powerful
she
feels
a
sense
of
triumph
rise
up
strongly
within
her
is
this
what
her
father
was
afraid
of
well
he
might
be
there
was
power
in
this
act
all
right
a
chainbreaking
power
that
was
blooddeep
she
feels
no
physical
pleasure
but
there
is
a
kind
of
mental
ecstasy
in
it
for
her
she
senses
the
closeness
he
puts
his
face
against
her
neck
and
she
holds
him
he
crying
she
holds
him
and
feels
the
part
of
him
that
made
a
connection
between
them
begin
to
fade
it
is
not
leaving
her
exactly
it
is
simply
fading
becoming
less
when
his
weight
shifts
away
she
sits
up
and
touches
his
face
in
the
darkness
did
you
did
i
wha
whatever
it
is
i
don't
know
exactly
he
shakes
his
head
she
feels
it
with
her
hand
against
his
cheek
don't
think
it
was
exactly
like
you
know
like
the
big
boys
say
but
it
was
it
was
really
something
he
speaks
low
so
the
others
can't
hear
i
love
you
bevvie
her
consciousness
breaks
down
a
little
there
she
quite
sure
there
more
talk
some
whispered
some
loud
and
can't
remember
what
is
said
it
doesn't
matter
does
she
have
to
talk
each
of
them
into
it
all
over
again
yes
probably
but
it
doesn't
matter
they
have
to
be
talked
into
it
this
essential
human
link
between
the
world
and
the
infinite
the
only
place
where
the
bloodstream
touches
eternity
it
doesn't
matter
what
matters
is
love
and
desire
here
in
this
dark
is
as
good
a
place
as
any
better
than
some
maybe
mike
comes
to
her
then
richie
and
the
act
is
repeated
now
she
feels
some
pleasure
dim
heat
in
her
childish
unmatured
sex
and
she
closes
her
eyes
as
stan
comes
to
her
and
she
thinks
of
the
birds
spring
and
the
birds
and
she
sees
them
again
and
again
all
lighting
at
once
filling
up
the
winternaked
trees
shockwave
riders
on
the
moving
edge
of
nature
most
violent
season
she
sees
them
take
wing
again
and
again
the
flutter
of
their
wings
like
the
snap
of
many
sheets
on
the
line
and
she
thinks
a
month
from
now
every
kid
in
derry
park
will
have
a
kite
they'll
run
to
keep
the
strings
from
getting
tangled
with
each
other
she
thinks
again
this
is
what
flying
is
like
with
stan
as
with
the
others
there
is
that
rueful
sense
of
fading
of
leaving
with
whatever
they
truly
need
from
this
actsome
ultimate
close
but
as
yet
unfound
did
yo
she
asks
again
and
although
she
doesn't
know
exactly
what
i
is
she
knows
that
he
hasn't
there
is
a
long
wait
and
then
ben
comes
to
her
he
is
trembling
all
over
but
it
is
not
the
fearful
trembling
she
felt
in
stan
beverly
i
can't
he
says
in
a
tone
which
purports
to
be
reasonable
and
is
anything
but
you
can
too
i
can
feel
it
she
sure
can
there
more
of
this
hardness
more
of
him
she
can
feel
it
below
the
gentle
push
of
his
belly
its
size
raises
a
certain
curiosity
and
she
touches
the
bulge
lightly
he
groans
against
her
neck
and
the
blow
of
his
breath
causes
her
bare
body
to
dimple
with
goosebumps
she
feels
the
first
twist
of
real
heat
race
through
her
suddenly
the
feeling
in
her
is
very
large
she
recognizes
that
it
is
too
big
and
is
he
too
big
can
she
take
that
into
herself
and
too
old
for
her
something
some
feeling
that
walks
in
boots
this
is
like
henry
m
s
something
not
meant
for
kids
something
that
could
explode
and
blow
you
up
but
this
was
not
the
place
or
time
for
worry
here
there
was
love
desire
and
the
dark
if
they
didn't
try
for
the
first
two
they
would
surely
be
left
with
the
last
beverly
don't
yes
show
me
how
to
fl
she
says
with
a
calmness
she
doesn't
feel
aware
by
the
fresh
wet
warmth
on
her
cheek
and
neck
that
he
has
begun
to
cry
show
me
ben
no
if
you
wrote
the
poem
show
me
feel
my
hair
if
you
want
to
ben
it
all
right
beverly
he
not
just
trembling
now
he
shaking
all
over
but
she
senses
again
that
this
ague
is
not
all
fear
part
of
it
is
the
precursor
of
the
throe
this
act
is
all
about
she
thinks
of
the
birds
his
face
his
dear
sweet
earnest
face
and
knows
it
is
not
fear
it
is
wanting
he
feels
a
deep
passionate
wanting
now
barely
held
in
check
and
she
feels
that
sense
of
power
again
something
like
flying
something
like
looking
down
from
above
and
seeing
all
the
birds
on
the
roofpeaks
on
the
tv
antenna
atop
wally
seeing
streets
spread
out
maplike
oh
desire
right
this
was
something
it
was
love
and
desire
that
taught
you
to
fly
ben
ye
she
cries
suddenly
and
the
leash
breaks
she
feels
pain
again
and
for
a
moment
there
is
the
frightening
sensation
of
being
crushed
then
he
props
himself
up
on
the
palms
of
his
hands
and
that
feeling
is
gone
he
big
oh
yes
the
pain
is
back
and
it
much
deeper
than
when
eddie
first
entered
her
she
has
to
bite
her
lip
again
and
think
of
the
birds
until
the
burning
is
gone
but
it
does
go
and
she
is
able
to
reach
up
and
touch
his
lips
with
one
finger
and
he
moans
the
heat
is
back
and
she
feels
her
power
suddenly
shift
to
him
she
gives
it
gladly
and
goes
with
it
there
is
a
sensation
first
of
being
rocked
of
a
delicious
spiralling
sweetness
which
makes
her
begin
to
turn
her
head
helplessly
from
side
to
side
and
a
tuneless
humming
comes
from
between
her
closed
lips
this
is
flying
this
oh
love
oh
desire
oh
this
is
something
impossible
to
deny
binding
giving
making
a
strong
circle
binding
giving
flying
oh
ben
oh
my
dear
ye
she
whispers
feeling
the
sweat
stand
out
on
her
face
feeling
their
connection
something
firmly
in
place
something
like
eternity
the
number
rocked
over
on
its
side
i
love
you
so
much
dear
and
she
feels
the
thing
begin
to
happen
something
of
which
the
girls
who
whisper
and
giggle
about
sex
in
the
girl
room
have
no
idea
at
least
as
far
as
she
knows
they
only
marvel
at
how
gooshy
sex
must
be
and
now
she
realizes
that
for
many
of
them
sex
must
be
some
unrealized
undefined
monster
they
refer
to
the
act
as
it
would
you
do
it
do
your
sister
and
her
boyfriend
do
it
do
your
mom
and
dad
still
do
it
and
how
they
never
intend
to
do
it
oh
yes
you
would
think
that
the
whole
girl
side
of
the
fifthgrade
class
was
made
up
of
spinsterstobe
and
it
is
obvious
to
beverly
that
none
of
them
can
suspect
this
this
conclusion
and
she
is
only
kept
from
screaming
by
her
knowledge
that
the
others
will
hear
and
think
her
badly
hurt
she
puts
the
side
of
her
hand
in
her
mouth
and
bites
down
hard
she
understands
the
screamy
laughter
of
greta
bowie
and
sally
mueller
and
all
the
others
better
now
hadn't
they
the
seven
of
them
spent
most
of
this
the
longest
scariest
summer
of
their
lives
laughing
like
loons
you
laugh
because
what
fearful
and
unknown
is
also
what
funny
you
laugh
the
way
a
small
child
will
sometimes
laugh
and
cry
at
the
same
time
when
a
capering
circus
clown
approaches
knowing
it
is
supposed
to
be
funny
but
it
is
also
unknown
full
of
the
unknown
eternal
power
biting
her
hand
will
not
stay
the
cry
and
she
can
only
reassure
them
and
ben
by
crying
out
her
affirmative
in
the
darkness
yes
yes
yes
glorious
images
of
flight
fill
her
head
mixing
with
the
harsh
calling
of
the
grackles
and
starlings
these
sounds
become
the
world
sweetest
music
so
she
flies
she
flies
up
and
now
the
power
is
not
with
her
or
with
him
but
somewhere
between
them
and
he
cries
out
and
she
can
feel
his
arms
trembling
and
she
arches
up
and
into
him
feeling
his
spasm
his
touch
his
total
fleeting
intimacy
with
her
in
the
dark
they
break
through
into
the
lifelight
together
then
it
is
over
and
they
are
in
each
other
arms
and
when
he
tries
to
say
something
perhaps
some
stupid
apology
that
would
hurt
what
she
remembers
some
stupid
apology
like
a
handcuff
she
stops
his
words
with
a
kiss
and
sends
him
away
bill
comes
to
her
he
tries
to
say
something
but
his
stutter
is
almost
total
now
you
be
quiet
she
says
secure
in
her
new
knowledge
but
aware
that
she
is
tired
now
tired
and
damned
sore
the
insides
and
backs
of
her
thighs
feel
sticky
and
she
thinks
it
maybe
because
ben
actually
finished
or
maybe
because
she
is
bleeding
everything
is
going
to
be
totally
okay
aaare
you
shuhshuhshuhhure
'
ye
she
says
and
links
her
hands
behind
his
neck
feeling
the
sweaty
mat
of
his
hair
you
just
bet
duhduhdoes
ihih
does
ihihih
shhh
it
is
not
as
it
was
with
ben
there
is
passion
but
not
the
same
kind
being
with
bill
now
is
the
best
conclusion
to
this
that
there
could
be
he
is
kind
tender
just
short
of
calm
she
senses
his
eagerness
but
it
is
tempered
and
held
back
by
his
anxiety
for
her
perhaps
because
only
bill
and
she
herself
realize
what
an
enormous
act
this
is
and
how
it
must
never
be
spoken
of
not
to
anyone
else
not
even
to
each
other
at
the
end
she
is
surprised
by
that
sudden
upsurge
and
she
has
time
to
think
oh
it
going
to
happen
again
i
don't
know
if
i
can
stand
it
but
her
thoughts
are
swept
away
by
the
utter
sweetness
of
it
and
she
barely
hears
him
whispering
i
love
you
bev
i
love
you
i'll
always
love
yo
saying
it
over
and
over
and
not
stuttering
at
all
she
hugs
him
to
her
and
for
a
moment
they
stay
that
way
his
smooth
cheek
against
hers
he
withdraws
from
her
without
saying
anything
and
for
a
little
while
she
alone
putting
her
clothes
back
together
slowly
putting
them
on
aware
of
a
dull
throbbing
pain
of
which
they
being
male
will
never
know
aware
also
of
a
certain
exhausted
pleasure
and
the
relief
of
having
it
over
there
is
an
emptiness
down
there
now
and
although
she
is
glad
that
her
sex
is
her
own
again
the
emptiness
imparts
a
strange
melancholy
which
she
could
never
express
except
to
think
of
bare
trees
under
a
white
winter
sky
empty
trees
trees
waiting
for
blackbirds
to
come
like
ministers
at
the
end
of
march
to
preside
over
the
death
of
snow
she
finds
them
by
groping
for
their
hands
for
a
moment
no
one
speaks
and
when
someone
does
it
does
not
surprise
her
much
that
it
eddie
i
think
when
we
went
right
two
turns
back
we
shoulda
gone
left
jeez
i
knew
that
but
i
was
so
sweaty
and
frigged
up
been
frigged
up
your
whole
life
eds
richie
says
his
voice
is
pleasant
the
raw
edge
of
panic
is
completely
gone
we
went
wrong
some
other
places
to
eddie
says
ignoring
him
but
that
the
worst
one
if
we
can
find
our
way
back
there
we
just
might
be
okay
they
form
up
in
a
clumsy
line
eddie
first
beverly
second
now
her
hand
on
eddie
shoulder
as
mike
is
on
hers
they
begin
to
move
again
faster
this
time
eddie
displays
none
of
his
former
nervous
care
we're
going
home
she
thinks
and
shivers
with
relief
and
joy
home
yes
and
that
will
be
good
we've
done
our
job
what
we
came
for
now
we
can
go
back
to
just
being
kids
again
and
that
will
be
good
too
as
they
move
through
the
dark
she
realizes
the
sound
of
running
water
is
closer
chapter
out
derry/
a.m
by
ten
past
nine
derry
windspeeds
were
being
clocked
at
an
average
of
fiftyfive
miles
an
hour
with
gusts
up
to
seventy
the
anemometer
in
the
courthouse
registered
one
gust
of
eightyone
and
then
the
needle
dropped
all
the
way
back
to
zero
the
wind
had
ripped
the
whirling
cuplike
device
on
the
courthouse
roof
off
its
moorings
and
it
flew
away
into
the
rainswept
dimness
of
the
day
like
george
denbrough
boat
it
was
never
seen
again
by
ninethirty
the
thing
the
derry
water
department
had
sworn
was
now
impossible
seemed
not
only
possible
but
imminert
that
downtown
derry
might
be
flooded
for
the
first
time
since
august
of
when
many
of
the
old
drains
had
clogged
up
or
caved
in
during
a
freak
rainstorm
by
quarter
often
men
with
grim
faces
were
arriving
in
cars
and
pickup
trucks
along
both
sides
of
the
canal
their
foulweather
gear
rippling
crazily
in
the
freighttrain
wind
for
the
first
time
since
october
of
sandbags
began
to
go
up
along
the
canal
cement
sides
the
arch
where
the
canal
went
under
the
threeway
intersection
at
the
heart
of
derry
downtown
area
was
full
almost
to
the
top
main
street
canal
street
and
the
foot
of
upmile
hill
were
impassable
except
by
foot
and
those
who
splashed
and
hurried
their
way
toward
the
sandbagging
operation
felt
the
very
streets
beneath
their
feet
trembling
with
the
frenzied
flow
of
the
water
the
way
a
turnpike
overpass
will
tremble
when
big
trucks
pass
each
other
but
this
was
a
steady
vibration
and
the
men
were
glad
to
be
on
the
north
side
of
downtown
away
from
that
steady
rumbling
that
vas
felt
rather
than
heard
harold
gardener
shouted
at
alfred
zitner
who
ran
zitner
realty
on
the
west
side
of
town
asked
him
if
the
streets
were
going
to
collapse
zitner
said
hell
would
freeze
over
before
something
like
that
happened
harold
had
a
bref
image
of
adolf
hitler
and
judas
iscariot
handing
out
iceskates
and
went
on
heaving
sandbags
the
water
was
now
less
than
three
inches
below
the
top
of
the
canal
cement
walls
in
the
barrens
the
kenduskeag
was
already
out
of
its
banks
and
by
noon
the
luxuriant
undergrowth
and
scrub
trees
would
be
poking
out
of
a
vast
shallow
stinking
lake
the
men
continued
to
work
pausing
only
when
the
supply
of
sandbags
ran
out
and
then
at
ten
of
ten
they
were
frozen
by
a
great
rending
ripping
sound
harold
gardener
later
told
his
wife
he
thought
maybe
the
end
of
the
world
had
come
it
wasn't
downtown
falling
into
the
earth
not
then
it
was
the
standpipe
only
andrew
keene
norbert
keene
grandson
actually
saw
it
happen
and
he
had
smoked
so
much
colonbian
red
that
morning
that
at
first
he
thought
it
had
to
be
a
hallucination
he
had
been
wandering
derry
stormswept
streets
since
about
eight
o'clock
roughly
the
same
time
that
dr
hale
was
ascending
to
that
great
family
medical
practice
in
the
sky
he
was
drenched
to
the
skin
except
for
the
twoounce
baggie
of
pot
tucked
up
into
his
armpit
that
was
but
totally
unaware
of
it
his
eyes
widened
in
disbelief
he
had
reached
memorial
park
which
stood
on
the
flank
of
standpipe
hill
and
unless
he
was
wrong
the
standpipe
now
had
a
pronounced
lean
like
that
fuckedup
tower
in
pisa
that
was
on
all
the
macaroni
boxes
oh
wow
andrew
keene
cried
his
eyes
widening
even
more
they
looked
as
if
they
might
be
on
small
tough
springs
now
as
the
splintering
sounds
began
the
standpipe
lean
was
becoming
more
and
more
acute
as
he
stood
there
with
his
jeans
plastered
to
his
skinny
shanks
and
his
drenched
paisley
headband
dripping
water
into
his
eyes
white
shingles
were
popping
off
the
downtown
side
of
the
great
round
watertower
no
not
exactly
popping
off
it
was
more
like
they
were
squirting
off
and
a
definite
crinkle
had
appeared
about
twenty
feet
above
the
standpipe
stone
foundation
water
suddenly
began
to
spray
out
through
this
crinkle
and
now
the
shingles
weren't
squirting
off
the
standpipe
downtown
side
they
were
spewing
into
the
windstream
a
rending
sound
began
to
come
from
the
standpipe
and
andrew
could
see
it
moving
like
the
hand
of
a
great
clock
inclining
from
noon
to
one
to
two
the
baggie
of
pot
fell
out
of
his
armpit
and
fetched
up
inside
his
shirt
somewhere
near
his
belt
he
didn't
notice
he
was
utterly
fetched
large
twanging
sounds
came
from
inside
the
standpipe
as
if
the
strings
of
the
world
biggest
guitar
were
being
broken
one
by
one
these
were
the
cables
inside
the
cylinder
which
had
provided
the
proper
balance
of
stress
against
the
water
pressure
the
standpipe
began
to
heel
over
faster
and
faster
boards
and
beams
ripping
apart
splinters
jumping
and
whirling
into
the
ar
faaar
fucking
owwwwt
andrew
keene
shrieked
but
it
was
lost
in
the
standpipe
final
crashing
fall
and
by
the
rising
sound
of
one
and
threequarter
million
gallons
of
water
seven
thousand
tons
of
water
pouring
out
of
the
building
ruptured
spouting
side
it
went
in
a
gray
tidal
wave
and
of
course
if
andrew
keene
had
been
on
the
downhill
side
of
the
standpipe
he
would
have
exited
the
world
in
no
time
but
god
favors
drunks
small
children
and
the
cataclysmically
stoned
andrew
was
standing
in
a
place
where
he
could
see
it
all
and
not
be
touched
by
a
single
drop
great
fucking
special
effects
andrew
screamed
as
the
water
rolled
over
memorial
park
like
a
solid
thing
sweeping
away
the
sundial
beside
which
a
small
boy
named
stan
uris
had
often
stood
watching
birds
with
his
father
field
glasses
steven
spielberg
eat
your
heart
ou
the
stone
birdbath
also
went
andrew
saw
it
for
a
moment
turning
over
and
over
pedestal
for
dish
and
dish
for
pedestal
and
then
it
was
gone
a
line
of
maples
and
birches
separating
memorial
park
from
kansas
street
were
knocked
down
like
so
many
pins
in
a
bowling
alley
they
took
wild
spiky
snarls
of
power
lines
with
them
the
water
rolled
across
the
street
beginning
to
spread
now
beginning
to
look
more
like
water
than
that
mind
boggling
solid
wall
that
had
taken
sundial
birdbath
and
trees
but
it
still
had
power
enough
to
sweep
almost
a
dozen
houses
on
the
far
side
of
kansas
street
off
their
foundations
and
into
the
barrens
they
went
with
sickening
ease
most
of
them
still
whole
andrew
keene
recognized
one
of
them
as
belonging
to
the
karl
massensik
family
mr
massensik
had
been
his
sixthgrade
teacher
a
real
pooch
as
the
house
went
over
the
edge
and
down
the
slope
andrew
realized
he
could
still
see
a
candle
burning
brightly
in
one
window
and
he
wondered
briefly
if
he
might
be
mentally
highsiding
it
if
you
could
dig
the
concept
there
was
an
explosion
from
the
barrens
and
a
brief
gout
of
yellow
flame
as
someone
coleman
gas
lantern
ignited
oil
pouring
out
of
a
ruptured
fueltank
andrew
stared
at
the
far
side
of
kansas
street
where
until
just
forty
seconds
ago
there
had
been
a
neat
line
of
middleclass
houses
they
were
gone
city
now
and
you
better
believe
it
sweet
thing
in
their
places
were
ten
cellarholes
that
looked
like
swimmingpools
andrew
wanted
to
advance
the
opinion
that
this
was
far
fucking
out
but
he
couldn't
yell
anymore
seemed
like
his
yeller
was
busted
his
diaphragm
felt
weak
and
useless
he
heard
a
series
of
crunching
thuds
the
sound
of
a
giant
with
his
shoes
full
of
ritz
crackers
marching
down
a
flight
of
stairs
it
was
the
standpipe
rolling
down
the
hill
a
huge
white
cylinder
still
spouting
the
last
of
its
water
supply
the
thick
cables
that
had
helped
to
hold
it
together
flying
into
the
air
and
then
cracking
down
again
like
steel
bullwhips
digging
runnels
in
the
soft
earth
that
immediately
filled
up
with
rushing
rainwater
as
andrew
watched
with
his
chin
resting
somewhere
between
his
collarbones
the
standpipe
horizontal
now
better
than
a
hundred
and
twentyfive
feet
long
flew
out
into
the
air
for
a
moment
it
seemed
frozen
there
a
surreal
image
straight
out
of
rubberwalled
strait
jacketed
toodleoo
land
rainwater
sparkling
on
its
shattered
sides
its
windows
broken
casements
hanging
the
flashing
light
on
top
meant
as
a
warning
for
lowflying
light
planes
still
flashing
and
then
it
fell
into
the
street
with
a
final
rending
crash
kansas
street
had
channelled
a
lot
of
the
water
and
now
it
began
to
rush
toward
downtown
by
way
of
up
mile
hill
there
used
to
be
houses
over
there
andrew
keene
thought
and
suddenly
all
the
strength
ran
out
of
his
legs
he
sat
down
heavily
kersplash
he
stared
at
the
broken
stone
foundation
on
which
the
standpipe
had
stood
for
his
whole
life
he
wondered
if
anyone
would
ever
believe
him
he
wondered
if
he
believed
it
himself
the
kill
/
a.m
may
ist
bill
and
richie
saw
it
turn
toward
them
its
mandibles
opening
and
closing
its
one
good
eye
glaring
down
at
them
and
bill
realized
it
gave
off
its
own
source
of
illumination
like
some
grisly
lightning
bug
but
the
light
was
flickering
and
uncertain
it
was
badly
hurt
its
thoughts
buzzed
and
racketed
let
me
go
let
me
go
and
you
can
have
everything
you've
ever
wanted
money
fame
fortune
power
i
can
give
you
these
things
in
his
head
bill
moved
forward
emptyhanded
his
eyes
fixed
on
its
single
red
one
he
felt
the
power
growing
inside
him
investing
him
knotting
his
arms
into
cords
filling
each
clenched
fist
with
its
own
force
richie
walked
beside
him
his
lips
pulled
back
over
his
teeth
i
can
give
you
your
wife
back
—i
can
do
it
only
i
she'll
remember
nothing
as
the
seven
of
you
remembered
nothing
they
were
close
very
close
now
bill
could
smell
its
stinking
aroma
and
realized
with
sudden
horror
that
it
was
the
smell
of
the
barrens
the
smell
they
had
taken
for
the
smell
of
sewers
and
polluted
streams
and
the
burning
dump
but
had
they
ever
really
believed
those
were
all
it
had
been
i
was
the
smell
of
it
and
perhaps
it
had
been
strongest
in
the
barrens
but
it
had
hung
over
all
derry
like
a
cloud
and
people
just
didn't
smell
it
the
way
zookeepers
don't
smell
their
charges
after
awhile
or
even
wonder
why
the
visitors
wrinkle
their
noses
when
they
come
in
us
two
he
muttered
to
richie
and
richie
nodded
without
taking
his
eyes
off
the
spider
which
now
shrank
back
from
them
its
abominable
spiny
legs
glittering
brought
to
bay
at
last
i
can't
give
you
eternal
life
but
i
an
touch
you
and
you
will
live
long
long
lives
two
hundred
years
three
hundred
perhaps
five
hundred
i
can
make
you
gods
of
the
earth
if
you
let
me
go
if
you
let
me
go
if
you
let
me

bill
richie
asked
hoarsely
with
a
scream
building
in
him
building
up
and
up
and
up
bill
charged
richie
ran
with
him
stride
for
stride
they
struck
together
with
their
right
fists
but
bill
understood
it
was
not
really
their
fists
they
were
striking
with
at
all
it
was
their
combined
force
augmented
by
the
force
of
that
other
it
was
the
force
of
memory
and
desire
above
all
else
it
was
the
force
of
love
and
unforgotten
childhood
like
one
big
wheel
the
spider
shriek
filled
bill
head
seeming
to
splinter
his
brains
he
felt
his
fist
plunge
deep
into
writhing
wetness
his
arm
followed
it
in
up
to
the
shoulder
he
pulled
it
back
dripping
with
the
spider
black
blood
ichor
poured
from
the
hole
he
had
made
he
saw
richie
standing
almost
beneath
its
bloated
body
covered
with
its
darkly
sparkling
blood
standing
in
the
classic
boxer
stance
his
dripping
fists
pumping
the
spider
lashed
at
them
with
its
legs
bill
felt
one
of
them
rip
down
his
side
parting
his
shirt
parting
skin
its
stinger
pumped
uselessly
against
the
floor
its
screams
were
clarion
bells
in
his
head
it
lunged
clumsily
forward
trying
to
bite
him
and
instead
of
retreating
bill
drove
forward
using
not
just
his
fist
now
but
his
whole
body
making
himself
into
a
torpedo
he
ran
into
its
gut
like
a
sprinting
fullback
who
lowers
his
shoulders
and
simply
drives
straight
ahead
for
a
moment
he
felt
its
stinking
flesh
simply
give
as
if
it
would
rebound
and
send
him
flying
with
an
inarticulate
scream
he
drove
harder
pushing
forward
and
upward
with
his
legs
digging
at
it
with
his
hands
and
he
broke
through
was
inundated
with
its
hot
fluids
they
ran
across
his
face
in
his
ears
he
snuffled
them
up
his
nose
in
thin
squirming
streams
he
was
in
the
black
again
up
to
his
shoulders
inside
its
convulsing
body
and
in
his
clogged
ears
he
could
hear
a
sound
like
the
steady
whackwhackwhackwhack
of
a
big
bass
drum
the
one
that
leads
the
parade
when
the
circus
comes
to
town
with
its
complement
of
freaks
and
strutting
capering
clowns
the
sound
of
its
heart
he
heard
richie
scream
in
sudden
pain
a
sound
that
rose
into
a
quick
gasping
moan
and
was
cut
off
bill
suddenly
thrust
both
fisted
hands
forward
he
was
choking
strangling
in
its
pulsing
bag
of
guts
and
waters
whackwhackwhackwhack
he
plunged
his
hands
into
it
ripping
tearing
parting
seeking
the
source
of
the
sound
rupturing
organs
his
slimed
fingers
opening
and
closing
his
locked
chest
seeming
to
swell
from
lack
of
air
whackwhack
whackwhack
and
suddenly
it
was
in
his
hands
a
great
living
thing
that
pumped
and
pulsed
against
his
palms
pushing
them
back
and
forth
nonononononono
yes
bill
cried
choking
drowning
yes
try
this
you
bitch
try
this
one
out
do
you
like
it
do
you
love
it
do
you
he
laced
his
ingers
together
over
the
pulsing
narthex
of
its
heart
palms
spread
apart
in
an
inverted
v
and
brought
them
together
with
all
the
force
he
could
muster
there
was
one
final
shriek
of
pain
and
fear
as
its
heart
exploded
between
his
hands
running
out
between
his
fingers
in
jittering
strings
whackwhackwhackwha
the
scream
fading
dwindling
bill
felt
its
body
clench
around
him
suddenly
like
a
fist
in
a
slick
glove
then
everything
loosened
he
became
aware
that
its
body
was
tilting
slipping
slowly
off
to
one
side
at
the
same
time
he
began
pulling
back
his
consciousness
leaving
him
the
spider
collapsed
on
its
side
a
huge
bundle
of
steaming
alien
meat
its
legs
still
quivering
and
jerking
caressing
the
sides
of
the
tunnel
and
scrapng
across
the
floor
in
random
scrawls
bill
staggered
away
breathing
in
whooping
gasps
spitting
in
an
effort
to
clear
his
mouth
of
its
horrible
taste
he
tripped
over
his
own
feet
and
fell
to
his
knees
and
clearly
he
heard
the
voice
of
the
other
the
turtle
might
be
dead
but
whatever
had
invested
it
was
not
son
you
did
real
good
then
it
was
gone
the
power
went
with
it
he
felt
weak
revulsed
halfinsane
he
looked
over
his
shoulder
and
saw
the
dying
black
nightmare
of
the
spider
still
jerking
and
quivering
richie
he
cried
out
in
a
hoarse
breaking
voice
richie
where
are
you
man
no
answer
the
light
was
gone
now
it
had
died
with
the
spider
he
fumbled
in
the
pocket
of
his
matted
shirt
for
the
last
book
of
matches
they
were
there
but
they
wouldn't
light
the
heads
were
soaked
with
blood
richie
he
screamed
again
beginning
to
weep
now
he
began
to
crawl
forward
first
one
hand
and
then
the
other
groping
in
the
dark
at
last
one
of
them
struck
something
which
yielded
limply
to
his
touch
his
hands
flew
over
it
and
stopped
as
they
touched
richie
face
richie
richie
still
no
answer
struggling
in
the
dark
bill
got
one
arm
under
richie
back
and
the
other
under
his
knees
he
wobbled
to
his
feet
and
began
to
stumble
back
the
way
they
had
come
with
richie
in
his
arms
derry
/
a.m
at
the
steady
vibration
which
had
been
running
through
derry
dowrtown
streets
increased
to
a
rumbling
roar
the
derry
news
would
later
write
that
the
supports
of
the
canal
underground
portion
weakened
by
the
savage
assault
of
what
amounted
to
a
flash
flood
simply
collapsed
there
were
however
people
who
disagreed
with
that
view
i
was
there
i
know
harold
gardener
later
told
his
wife
it
wasn't
just
that
the
canal
supports
collapsed
it
was
an
earthquake
that
what
it
was
it
was
a
fucking
earthquake
either
way
the
results
were
the
same
as
the
rumbling
built
steadily
up
and
up
windows
began
to
shatter
plaster
ceilings
began
to
fall
and
the
inhuman
cry
of
twisting
beams
and
foundations
swelled
into
a
frightening
chorus
cracks
raced
up
the
bulletpocked
brick
facade
of
machen
like
grasping
hands
the
cables
holding
the
marquee
of
the
aladdin
theater
out
over
the
street
snapped
and
the
marquee
came
crashing
down
richard
alley
which
ran
behind
the
center
street
drug
suddenly
filled
up
with
an
avalanche
of
yellow
brick
as
the
brian
x
dowd
professional
building
erected
in
came
crashing
down
a
huge
screen
of
jaundice
colored
dust
rose
in
the
air
and
was
snatched
away
like
a
veil
at
the
same
time
the
statue
of
paul
bunyan
in
front
of
the
city
center
exploded
it
was
as
if
that
longago
art
teacher
threat
to
blow
it
up
had
finally
proved
to
be
dead
serious
after
all
the
bearded
grinning
head
rose
straight
up
in
the
air
one
leg
kicked
forward
the
other
back
as
if
paul
had
attempted
some
sort
of
a
split
so
enthusiastic
it
had
resulted
in
dismemberment
the
statue
midsection
blew
out
in
a
cloud
of
shrapnel
and
the
head
of
the
plastic
axe
rose
into
the
rainy
sky
disappeared
and
then
came
down
again
twirling
end
over
end
it
sheared
through
the
roof
of
the
kissing
bridge
and
then
its
floor
and
then
at
a.m
downtown
derry
simply
collapsed
most
of
the
water
from
the
ruptured
standpipe
had
crossed
kansas
street
and
ended
up
in
the
barrens
but
tons
of
it
rushed
down
into
the
business
district
by
way
of
upmile
hill
perhaps
that
was
the
straw
that
broke
the
camel
back
or
perhaps
as
harold
gardener
told
his
wife
there
really
was
an
earthquake
cracks
raced
across
the
surface
of
main
street
they
were
narrow
at
first
and
then
they
began
to
gape
like
hungry
mouths
and
the
sound
of
the
canal
floated
up
not
muffled
now
but
frighteningly
loud
everything
began
to
shake
the
neon
sign
proclaiming
outlet
moccasins
in
front
of
shorty
squires
souvenir
shop
hit
the
street
and
shorted
out
in
three
feet
of
water
a
moment
or
two
later
shorty
building
which
stood
next
to
mr
paperback
began
to
descend
buddy
angstrom
was
the
first
to
see
this
phenomenon
he
elbowed
alfred
zitner
who
looked
gaped
and
then
elbowed
harold
gardener
within
a
space
of
seconds
the
sandbagging
operation
stopped
the
men
lining
both
sides
of
the
canal
only
stood
and
stared
toward
downtown
in
the
pouring
rain
their
faces
stamped
with
identical
expressions
of
horrified
wonder
squires
souvenirs
and
sundries
appeared
to
have
been
built
on
some
huge
elevator
which
was
now
on
the
way
down
it
sank
into
the
apparently
solid
concrete
with
ponderous
stately
dignity
when
it
came
to
a
stop
you
could
have
dropped
to
your
hands
and
knees
on
the
flooded
sidewalk
and
entered
through
one
of
the
thirdfloor
windows
water
sprayed
up
all
around
the
building
and
a
moment
later
shorty
himself
appeared
on
the
roof
waving
his
arms
madly
for
rescue
then
he
was
obliterated
as
the
officebuilding
next
door
the
one
which
housed
mr
paperback
at
ground
level
also
sank
into
the
ground
unfortunately
this
one
did
not
go
straight
down
as
shorty
building
had
done
the
mr
paperback
building
developed
a
marked
lean
for
a
moment
in
fact
it
bore
a
strong
resemblance
to
that
fuckedup
tower
in
pisa
the
one
on
the
macaroni
boxes
as
it
tilted
bricks
began
to
shower
from
its
top
and
sides
shorty
was
struck
by
several
harold
gardener
saw
him
reel
backward
hands
to
his
head
and
then
the
top
three
floors
of
the
mr
paperback
building
slid
off
as
neatly
as
pancakes
from
the
top
of
a
stack
shorty
disappeared
someone
on
the
sandbag
line
screamed
and
then
everything
was
lost
in
the
grinding
roar
of
destruction
men
were
knocked
off
their
feet
or
sent
wobbling
and
staggering
back
from
the
canal
harold
gardener
saw
the
buildings
which
faced
each
other
across
main
street
lean
forward
like
ladies
kibbitzing
over
a
cardgame
their
heads
almost
touching
the
street
itself
was
sinking
cracking
breaking
up
water
splashed
and
sprayed
and
then
one
after
another
buildings
on
both
sides
of
the
street
simply
swayed
past
their
centers
of
gravity
and
crashed
into
the
street
the
northeast
bank
the
shoeboat
alvey
smokes
n
jokes
bailley
lunch
bandler
record
and
music
barn
except
that
by
then
there
was
really
no
street
for
them
to
crash
into
the
street
had
fallen
into
the
canal
stretching
like
taffy
at
first
and
then
breaking
up
into
bobbing
chunks
of
asphalt
harold
saw
the
trafficisland
at
the
threestreet
intersection
suddenly
drop
out
of
sight
and
as
water
geysered
up
he
suddenly
understood
what
was
going
to
happen
gotta
get
out
of
her
he
screamed
at
al
zitner
tt
gonna
backwater
al
its
gonna
backwate
al
zitner
gave
no
sign
that
he
had
heard
his
was
the
face
of
a
sleepwalker
or
perhaps
of
a
man
who
has
been
deeply
hypnotized
he
stood
in
his
soaked
redandbluechecked
sportcoat
in
his
opencollared
lacoste
shirt
with
the
little
alligator
on
the
left
boob
in
his
blue
socks
with
the
crossed
white
golfclubs
knitted
into
their
sides
in
his
brown
l
l
bean
boat
shoes
with
the
rubber
soles
he
was
watching
perhaps
a
million
dollars
of
his
own
personal
investments
sinking
into
the
street
three
or
four
millions
of
his
friends
investments
the
guys
he
played
poker
with
the
guys
he
golfed
with
the
guys
he
skied
with
at
his
time
sharing
condo
in
rangely
suddenly
his
home
town
derry
maine
for
christ
sake
looked
bizarrely
like
that
fuckedup
city
where
the
wogs
pushed
people
around
in
those
long
skinny
canoes
water
roiled
and
boiled
between
the
buildings
that
were
still
standing
canal
street
ended
in
a
jagged
black
diving
board
over
the
edge
of
a
churning
lake
it
was
really
no
wonder
zitner
hadn't
heard
harold
others
however
had
come
to
the
same
conclusion
gardener
had
come
to
you
couldn't
drop
that
much
shit
into
a
raging
body
of
water
without
causing
a
lot
of
trouble
some
dropped
the
sandbags
they
had
been
holding
and
took
to
their
heels
harold
gardener
was
one
of
these
and
so
he
lived
others
were
not
so
lucky
and
were
still
somewhere
in
the
general
area
as
the
canal
its
throat
now
choked
with
tons
of
asphalt
concrete
brick
plaster
glass
and
about
four
million
dollar
worth
of
assorted
merchandise
backsurged
and
poured
over
its
concrete
sleeve
carrying
away
men
and
sandbags
impartially
harold
kept
thinking
it
meant
to
have
him
no
matter
how
fast
he
ran
the
water
kept
gaming
he
finally
escaped
by
clawing
his
way
up
a
steep
embankment
covered
with
shrubbery
he
looked
back
once
and
saw
a
man
he
believed
to
be
roger
lernerd
the
head
loan
officer
at
harold
credit
union
trying
to
start
his
car
in
the
parkinglot
of
the
canal
mini
mall
even
over
the
roar
of
the
water
and
the
bellowing
wind
harold
could
hear
the
kcar
little
sewingmachine
engine
cranking
and
cranking
and
cranking
as
smooth
black
water
ran
rockerpanel
high
on
both
sides
of
it
then
with
a
deep
thundering
cry
the
kenduskeag
poured
out
of
its
banks
and
swept
both
the
canal
minimall
and
roger
lernerd
bright
red
kcar
away
harold
began
climbing
again
grabbing
onto
branches
roots
anything
that
looked
solid
enough
to
take
his
weight
higher
ground
that
was
the
ticket
as
andrew
keene
might
have
said
harold
gardener
was
really
into
the
concept
of
higher
ground
that
morning
behind
him
he
could
hear
downtown
derry
continuing
to
collapse
the
sound
was
like
artillery
fire
bill
beverly
he
shouted
his
back
and
arms
were
one
solid
throbbing
ache
richie
now
seemed
to
weigh
at
least
five
hundred
pounds
put
him
down
then
his
mind
whispered

and
when
richie
was
done
they
walked
on
every
now
and
then
his
foot
struck
something
brittle
that
rolled
off
into
the
darkness
parts
of
the
spider
eggs
that
ben
had
tromped
to
pieces
he
supposed
and
shivered
it
was
good
to
know
they
were
going
in
the
right
direction
but
he
was
still
glad
he
couldn't
see
the
remains
beverly
ben
shouted
beverly
here
her
cry
was
faint
almost
lost
in
the
steady
rumble
of
the
water
they
moved
forward
in
the
dark
calling
to
her
steadily
zeroing
in
when
they
finally
reached
her
bill
asked
if
she
had
any
matches
left
she
put
half
a
pack
in
his
hand
he
lit
one
and
saw
their
faces
spring
into
ghostly
being
ben
with
his
arm
around
richie
who
was
standing
slumped
blood
running
from
his
right
temple
beverly
with
eddie
head
in
her
lap
then
he
turned
the
other
way
audra
was
lying
crumpled
on
the
flagstones
her
legs
asprawl
her
head
turned
away
the
webbing
had
mostly
melted
off
her
the
match
burned
his
fingers
and
he
let
it
drop
in
the
darkness
he
misjudged
the
distance
tripped
over
her
and
nearly
went
sprawling
audra
audra
can
you
hhhear
m
me
he
got
an
arm
under
her
back
ad
sat
her
up
he
slipped
a
hand
under
the
sheaf
of
her
hair
and
pressed
his
fingers
against
the
side
of
her
neck
her
pulse
was
there
a
slow
steady
beat
he
lit
another
match
and
as
it
flared
he
saw
her
pupils
contract
but
that
was
an
involuntary
function
the
fix
of
her
gaze
did
not
change
even
when
he
brought
the
match
close
enough
to
her
face
to
redden
her
skin
she
was
alive
but
unresponsive
hell
it
was
worse
than
that
and
he
knew
it
she
was
catatonic
the
second
match
burned
his
finge
rs
he
shook
it
out
bill
i
don't
like
the
sound
of
that
water
ben
said
i
think

said
softly

you'll
know
bill
he
picked
audra
up
as
he
had
picked
richie
up
and
went
back
to
the
others
the
feel
of
her
in
his
arms
was
disquieting
creepy
she
was
like
a
breathing
waxwork
which
way
bill
ben
asked
idddon't
you'll
know
you
killed
it
and
you'll

man
richie
said
come
on
ben
between
them
they
managed
to
hoist
up
eddie
body
beverly
lit
them
back
to
the
fairytale
door
bill
took
audra
through
it
holding
her
up
from
the
floor
as
best
he
could
richie
and
ben
carried
eddie
through
put

richie
sobbed

too
dark
eds
he
no

ben
said
maybe

is
where
he
supposed
to
be
i
think
maybe
it
is
they
put
him
down
and
richie
kissed
eddie
cheek
then
he
looked
blindly
up
at
ben
you
sure
yeah
come
on
richie
richie
got
up
and
turned
toward
the
door
fuck
you
bitch
he
cried
suddenly
and
kicked
the
door
shut
with
his
foot
it
made
a
solid
chukking
sound
as
it
closed
and
latched
why'd
you
do
that
beverly
asked
don't
know
richie
said
but
he
knew
well
enough
he
looked
back
over
his
shoulder
just
as
the
match
beverly
was
holding
went
out
bill
the
mark
on
the
door
what
about
it
bill
panted
richie
said
it
gone
derry
/
a.m
the
glass
corridor
connecting
the
adult
library
to
the
children
library
suddenly
exploded
in
a
single
brilliant
flare
of
light
glass
flew
out
in
an
umbrella
shape
whickering
through
the
straining
whipping
trees
which
dotted
the
library
grounds
someone
could
have
been
severely
hurt
or
even
killed
by
such
a
deadly
fusillade
but
there
was
no
one
there
either
inside
or
out
the
library
had
not
been
opened
that
day
at
all
the
tunnel
which
had
so
fascinated
ben
hanscom
as
a
boy
would
never
be
replaced
there
had
been
so
much
costly
destruction
in
derry
that
it
seemed
simpler
to
leave
the
two
libraries
as
separate
unconnected
buildings
in
time
no
one
on
the
derry
city
council
could
even
remember
what
that
glass
umbilicus
had
been
for
perhaps
only
ben
himself
could
really
have
told
them
how
it
was
to
stand
outside
in
the
still
cold
of
a
january
night
your
nose
running
the
tips
of
your
fingers
numb
inside
your
mittens
watching
the
people
pass
back
and
forth
inside
walking
through
winter
with
their
coats
off
and
surrounded
by
light
he
could
have
told
them
but
maybe
it
wasn't
the
sort
of
thing
you
could
have
gotten
up
and
testified
about
at
a
city
council
meeting
how
you
stood
out
in
the
cold
dark
and
learned
to
love
the
light
all
of
that
as
may
be
the
facts
were
just
these
the
glass
corridor
blew
up
for
no
apparent
reason
no
one
was
hurt
which
was
a
blessing
since
the
final
toll
taken
by
that
morning
storm
in
human
terms
at
least
was
sixtyseven
killed
and
better
than
three
hundred
and
twenty
injured
and
it
was
never
rebuilt
after
may
st
of
if
you
wanted
to
get
from
the
children
library
to
the
adult
library
you
had
to
walk
outside
to
do
it
and
if
it
was
cold
or
raining
or
snowing
you
had
to
put
on
your
coat
out/
a.m
may
st
wait
bill
gasped
give
me
a
chance
rest
let
me
help
you
with
her
richie
said
again
they
had
left
eddie
back
in
the
spider
lair
and
that
was
something
none
of
them
wanted
to
talk
about
but
eddie
was
dead
and
audra
was
still
alive
at
least
technically
ti
do
i
bill
said
between
choked
gasps
for
air
bullshit
you'll
give
yourself
a
fucking
heart
attack
let
me
help
you
big
bill
how
your
hh
head
hurts
richie
said
don't
change
the
subject
reluctantly
bill
let
richie
take
her
it
could
have
been
worse
audra
was
a
tall
girl
whose
normal
weight
was
one
hundred
and
forty
pounds
but
the
part
she'd
been
scheduled
to
play
in
attic
room
was
that
of
a
young
woman
being
held
hostage
by
a
borderline
psychotic
who
fancied
himself
a
political
terrorist
because
freddie
firestone
had
wanted
to
shoot
all
of
the
attic
sequences
first
audra
had
gone
on
a
strict
poultry
cottagecheese
tunafish
diet
and
lost
twenty
pounds
still
after
stumblestaggering
along
with
her
in
the
dark
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
or
a
half
or
threequarters
of
a
mile
or
who
knew
that
one
hundred
and
twenty
felt
more
like
two
hundred
th
thanks
m
m
ma
he
said
don't
mention
it
your
turn
next
haystack
beepbeep
richie
ben
said
and
bill
grinned
in
spite
of
himself
it
was
a
tired
grin
and
it
didn't
last
long
but
a
little
was
better
than
none
which
way
bill
beverly
asked
that
water
sounds
louder
than
ever
i
don't
really
fancy
drowning
down
here
straight
ahead
then
left
bill
said
maybe
we
better
try
to
go
a
little
faster
they
went
on
for
half
an
hour
bill
calling
the
lefts
and
rights
the
sound
of
the
water
continued
to
swell
until
it
seemed
to
surround
them
a
scary
dolby
stereo
effect
in
the
dark
bill
felt
his
way
around
a
corner
one
hand
trailing
over
damp
brick
and
suddenly
water
was
running
over
his
shoes
the
current
was
shallow
and
fast
give
me
audra
he
said
to
ben
who
was
panting
loudly
upstream
now
ben
passed
her
carefully
back
to
bill
who
managed
to
sling
her
over
his
shoulder
ma
fireman
carry
if
she'd
only
protest
move
do
something
how
matches
bev
not
many
half
a
dozen
maybe
bill
do
you
know
where
you're
going
i
think
i
ddd
he
said
come
on
they
followed
him
around
the
corner
the
water
foamed
about
bill
ankles
then
it
was
up
to
his
shins
and
then
it
was
thighdeep
the
thunder
of
the
water
had
deepened
to
a
steady
bass
roar
the
tunnel
they
were
in
was
shaking
steadily
for
awhile
bill
thought
the
current
was
going
to
become
too
strong
to
walk
against
but
then
they
passed
a
feederpipe
that
was
pouring
a
huge
jet
of
water
nto
their
tunnel
he
marvelled
at
the
whitewater
force
of
it
and
the
current
slacked
off
somewhat
although
the
water
continued
to
deepen
it
isaw
the
water
coming
out
of
that
feederpipe
saw
it
hhhey
he
shouted
can
yyyou
guys
see
aany
thing
'
its
been
getting
lighter
for
the
last
fifteen
minutes
or
so
beverly
shouted
back
where
are
we
bill
do
you
kno
i
thought
i
did
bill
almost
said
no
come
on”
he
had
believed
they
must
be
approaching
the
concretechannelled
section
of
the
kenduskeag
that
was
called
the
canal
the
part
that
went
under
downtown
and
came
out
in
bassey
park
but
there
was
light
down
here
light
and
surely
there
could
be
no
light
in
the
canal
under
the
city
but
it
brightened
steadily
just
the
same
bill
was
beginning
to
have
serious
problems
with
audra
it
wasn't
the
current
that
had
slackened
it
was
the
depth
pretty
soon
i'll
be
floating
her
he
thought
he
could
see
ben
on
his
left
and
beverly
on
his
right
by
turning
his
head
slightly
he
could
see
richie
behind
ben
the
footing
was
getting
decidedly
odd
the
bottom
of
the
tunnel
was
now
heaped
and
mounded
with
detritus
bricks
it
felt
like
and
up
ahead
something
was
sticking
out
of
the
water
like
the
prow
of
a
ship
that
is
in
the
process
of
sinking
ben
floundered
toward
it
shivering
in
the
cold
water
a
soggy
cigar
box
floated
into
his
face
he
pushed
it
aside
and
grabbed
at
the
thing
sticking
out
of
the
water
his
eyes
widened
it
appeared
to
be
a
large
sign
he
was
able
to
read
the
letters
al
and
below
that
fut
and
suddenly
he
knew
bill
richie
bev
he
was
laughing
with
astonishment
what
is
it
ben
beverly
shouted
grabbing
it
with
both
hands
ben
rocked
it
back
there
was
a
grating
sound
as
one
side
of
the
sign
scraped
along
the
wall
of
the
tunnel
now
they
could
read
aladdi
and
below
that
back
to
the
future
tt
the
marquee
for
the
aladdi
richie
said
how
the
street
caved
in
bill
whispered
his
eyes
were
widening
he
stared
up
the
tunnel
the
light
was
brighter
still
up
ahead
what
bill
what
the
fuck
happened
bill
bill
what
all
these
drains
bill
said
wildly
all
these
old
drains
there
been
another
flood
and
i
think
this
time
he
began
to
flounder
ahead
again
holding
audra
up
ben
bev
and
richie
fell
in
behind
him
five
minutes
later
bill
looked
up
and
saw
blue
sky
he
was
looking
through
a
crack
in
the
ceiling
of
the
tunnel
a
crack
that
widened
to
better
than
seventy
feet
across
as
it
ran
away
from
where
he
stood
the
water
was
broken
by
many
islands
and
archipelagos
up
ahead
piles
of
bricks
the
back
deck
of
a
plymouth
sedan
with
its
trunk
sprung
open
and
pouring
water
a
parkingmeter
leaning
against
the
tunnel
wal
at
a
drunken
slant
its
red
violation
flag
up
the
footing
had
become
almost
impossible
now
minmountains
that
rose
and
fell
with
no
rhyme
or
reason
inviting
a
broken
ankle
the
water
ran
mildly
around
their
armpits
mild
now
bill
thought
but
if
we'd
been
here
two
hours
ago
even
one
i
think
we
might
have
gotten
the
ride
of
our
lives
what
the
fuck
is
this
big
bill
richie
asked
he
was
standing
at
bill
left
elbow
his
face
soft
with
wonder
as
he
looked
up
at
the
np
in
the
roof
of
the
tunnel
except
it
not
the
roof
of
any
tunnel
bill
thought
it
main
street
at
least
it
used
to
be
i
think
most
of
downtown
derry
is
now
in
the
canal
and
being
carried
down
the
kenduskeag
river
pretty
soon
it'll
be
in
the
penobscot
and
then
it
will
be
in
the
atlantic
ocean
and
good
fucking
riddance
can
you
help
me
with
audra
richie
i
don't
think
i
can
sure
richie
said
sure
bill
no
sweat
he
took
audra
from
bill
in
this
light
bill
could
see
her
better
than
he
perhaps
wanted
to
her
pallor
masked
but
not
hidden
by
the
dirt
and
ordure
that
smeared
her
forehead
and
caked
her
cheeks
her
eyes
were
still
wide
open
wide
open
and
innocent
of
all
sense
her
hair
hung
lank
and
wet
she
might
as
well
have
been
one
of
those
inflatable
doilies
they
sold
at
the
pleasure
chest
in
new
york
or
along
the
reeperbahn
in
hamburg
the
only
difference
was
her
slow
steady
respiration
and
that
might
have
been
a
clockwork
trick
no
more
than
that
how
are
we
going
to
get
up
from
here
he
asked
richie
get
ben
to
give
you
ten
fingers
richie
said
you
can
yank
bev
up
and
the
two
of
you
can
get
your
wife
ben
can
boost
me
and
we'll
get
ben
and
after
that
i'll
show
you
how
to
set
up
a
volleyball
tournament
for
a
thousand
sorority
girls
beep
beep
richie
beepbeep
your
ass
big
bill
the
tiredness
was
going
through
him
in
steady
waves
he
caught
beverly
level
gaze
and
held
it
for
a
moment
she
nodded
to
him
slightly
and
he
made
a
smile
for
her
give
me
ten
fingers
b
b
ben
ben
who
also
looked
unutterably
weary
nodded
a
deep
scratch
ran
down
one
cheek
i
think
i
can
handle
that
he
stooped
slightly
and
laced
his
hands
together
bill
hiked
one
foot
stepped
into
ben
hand
and
jumped
up
it
wasn't
quite
enough
ben
lifted
the
step
he
had
made
with
his
hands
and
bill
grabbed
the
edge
of
the
broken
in
tunnel
roof
he
yanked
himself
up
the
first
thing
he
saw
was
a
whiteandorange
crash
barrier
the
second
thing
was
a
crowd
of
milling
men
and
women
beyond
the
barrier
the
third
was
freese
department
store
only
it
had
an
oddly
bulgedout
foreshortened
look
it
took
him
a
moment
to
realize
that
almost
half
of
freese
had
sunk
into
the
street
and
the
canal
beneath
the
top
half
had
dued
out
over
the
street
and
seemed
in
danger
of
toppling
over
like
a
pile
of
badly
stacked
books
look
look
there
someone
in
the
street
a
woman
was
pointing
toward
the
place
where
bill
head
had
poked
out
of
the
crevasse
in
the
shattered
pavement
praise
god
there
someone
else
she
started
forward
an
elderly
woman
with
a
kerchief
tied
over
her
head
peasantstyle
a
cop
held
her
back
not
safe
out
there
mrs
nelson
you
know
it
rest
of
the
street
might
go
any
time
mrs
nelson
bill
thought
i
remember
you
your
sister
used
to
sit
george
and
me
sometimes
he
raised
his
hand
to
show
her
he
was
all
right
and
when
she
raised
her
own
hand
in
return
he
felt
a
sudden
surge
of
good
feelings
and
hope
he
turned
around
and
lay
flat
on
the
sagging
pavement
trying
to
distribute
his
weight
as
evenly
as
possible
the
way
you
were
supposed
to
do
on
thin
ice
he
reached
down
for
bev
she
grasped
his
wrists
and
with
what
seemed
to
be
the
last
of
his
strength
he
pulled
her
up
the
sun
which
had
disappeared
again
now
ran
out
from
behind
a
brace
of
mackerelscale
clouds
and
gave
them
their
shadows
back
beverly
looked
up
startled
caught
bill
eyes
and
smiled
i
love
you
bill
she
said
and
i
pray
she'll
be
all
right
thuhhank
you
bevvie
he
said
and
his
kind
smile
made
her
start
to
cry
a
little
he
hugged
her
and
the
small
crowd
gathered
behind
the
crash
barrier
applauded
a
photographer
from
the
derry
news
snapped
a
picture
it
appeared
in
the
june
ist
edition
of
the
paper
which
was
printed
in
bangor
because
of
water
damage
to
the
news
presses
the
caption
was
simple
enough
and
true
enough
for
bill
to
cut
the
picture
out
and
keep
it
tucked
away
in
his
wallet
for
years
to
come
survivors
the
caption
read
that
was
all
but
that
was
enough
it
was
six
minutes
of
eleven
in
derry
maine
derry
/
later
the
same
day
the
glass
corridor
between
the
children
library
and
the
adult
library
had
exploded
at
am
at
the
rain
stopped
it
didn't
taper
off
it
stopped
all
at
once
as
if
someone
up
there
had
flicked
a
toggle
switch
the
wind
had
already
begun
to
fall
and
it
fell
so
rapidly
that
people
stared
at
each
other
with
uneasy
superstitious
faces
the
sound
was
like
the
winddown
of
a

engines
after
it
has
been
safely
parked
at
the
gate
the
sun
peeked
out
for
the
first
time
at
by
midafternoon
the
clouds
had
burned
away
entirely
and
the
day
had
come
off
fair
and
hot
by
p.m
the
mercury
in
the
orange
crush
thermometer
outside
the
door
of
secondhand
rose
secondhand
clothes
read
eightythree
the
highest
reading
of
the
young
season
people
walked
through
the
streets
like
zombies
not
talking
much
their
expressions
were
remarkably
similar
a
kind
of
stupid
wonder
that
would
have
been
funny
if
it
was
not
also
so
frankly
pitiable
by
evening
reporters
from
abc
cbs
nbc
and
cnn
had
arrived
in
derry
and
the
network
news
reporters
would
bring
some
version
of
the
truth
home
to
most
people
they
would
make
it
real
although
here
were
those
who
might
have
suggested
that
reality
is
a
highly
untrustworthy
concept
something
perhaps
no
more
solid
than
a
piece
of
canvas
stretched
over
an
interlacing
of
cables
like
the
strands
of
a
spiderweb
the
following
moming
bryant
gumble
and
willard
scott
of
the
today
show
would
be
in
derry
during
the
course
of
the
program
gumble
would
interview
andrew
keene
whole
standpipe
just
crashed
over
and
rolled
down
the
hill
andrew
said
tt
was
like
wow
you
know
what
i
mean
like
steven
spielberg
eat
your
heart
out
you
know
hey
i
always
got
the
idea
looking
at
you
on
tv
that
you
were
you
know
a
lot
bigger
seeing
themselves
and
their
neighbors
on
tv
that
would
make
it
real
it
would
give
them
a
place
from
which
to
grasp
this
terrible
ungraspable
thing
it
had
been
a
freak
storm
in
the
days
following
the
deathcount
would
rise
in
the
wake
of
the
killer
storm
it
was
in
fact
the
worst
spring
storm
in
maine
history
all
of
these
headlines
as
terrible
as
they
were
were
useful
they
helped
to
blunt
the
essential
strangeness
of
what
had
happened
or
perhaps
strangeness
was
too
mild
a
word
insanity
might
have
been
better
seeing
themselves
on
tv
would
help
make
it
concrete
less
insane
but
in
the
hours
before
the
news
crews
arrived
there
were
only
the
people
from
derry
walking
through
their
rubblestrewn
mud
slicked
streets
with
expressions
of
stunned
unbelief
on
their
faces
only
the
people
from
derry
not
talking
much
looking
at
things
occasionally
picking
things
up
and
then
tossing
them
down
again
trying
to
figure
out
what
had
happened
during
the
last
seven
or
eight
hours
men
stood
on
kansas
street
smoking
looking
at
houses
lying
upside
down
in
the
barrens
other
men
and
women
stood
beyond
the
whiteandorange
crash
barriers
looking
into
the
black
hole
that
had
been
downtown
until
ten
that
morning
the
headline
of
that
sunday
paper
read
we
will
rebuild
vows
derry
mayor
and
perhaps
they
would
but
in
the
weeks
that
followed
while
the
city
council
wrangled
over
how
he
rebuilding
should
begin
the
huge
crater
that
had
been
downtown
continued
to
grow
in
an
unspectacular
but
steady
way
four
days
after
the
storm
the
office
building
of
the
bangor
hydroelectric
company
collapsed
into
the
hole
three
days
after
that
the
flying
doghouse
which
sold
the
best
kraut
and
chilidogs
in
eastern
maine
fell
in
drains
backed
up
periodically
in
houses
apartment
buildings
and
businesses
it
got
so
bad
in
the
old
cape
that
people
began
to
leave
june
th
was
the
first
evening
of
horseracing
at
bassey
park
the
first
race
was
scheduled
for
p.m
and
that
seemed
to
cheer
everyone
up
but
a
section
of
bleachers
collapsed
as
the
trotters
in
the
first
race
turned
into
the
home
stretch
and
half
a
dozen
people
were
hurt
one
of
them
was
foxy
foxworth
who
had
managed
the
aladdin
theater
until
foxy
spent
two
weeks
in
the
hospital
suffering
from
a
broken
leg
and
a
punctured
testicle
when
he
was
released
he
decided
to
go
to
his
sister
in
somersworth
new
hampshire
he
wasn't
the
only
one
derry
was
falling
apart
they
watched
the
orderly
slam
the
back
doors
of
the
ambulance
and
go
around
to
the
passenger
seat
the
ambulance
started
up
the
hill
toward
the
derry
home
hospital
richie
had
flagged
it
down
at
severe
risk
of
life
and
limb
and
had
argued
the
irate
driver
to
a
draw
when
the
driver
insisted
he
just
didn't
have
any
more
room
he
had
ended
up
stretching
audra
out
on
the
floor
now
wha
ben
asked
there
were
huge
brown
circles
under
his
eyes
and
a
grimy
ring
of
dirt
around
his
neck
tm
ggoing
back
to
the
town
house
bill
said
ggonna
sleep
for
about
suhhixteen
hours
i
second
that
richie
said
he
looked
hopefully
at
bev
got
any
cigarettes
purty
lady
n
beverly
said
i
think
i'm
going
to
quit
again
sensible
enough
idea
they
began
to
walk
slowly
up
the
hill
the
four
of
them
side
by
side
tt
ooove
bill
said
ben
nodded
we
did
it

bill

it
beverly
said
i
wish
we
could
have
brought
eddie
up
i
wish
that
more
than
anything
they
reached
the
corner
of
upper
main
and
point
street
a
kid
in
a
red
rainslicker
and
green
rubber
boots
was
sailing
a
paper
boat
along
the
brisk
run
of
water
in
the
gutter
he
looked
up
saw
them
looking
at
him
and
waved
tentatively
bill
thought
it
was
the
boy
with
the
skateboard
the
one
whose
friend
had
seen
jaws
in
the
canal
he
smiled
and
stepped
toward
the
boy
tt
all
right
nnno
he
said
the
boy
studied
him
gravely
and
then
grinned
the
smile
was
sunny
and
hopeful
yea
he
said
i
think
it
is
bet
your
aaass
the
kid
laughed
you
œ
gonna
be
careful
on
thuhhat
skateboard
not
really
the
kid
said
and
this
time
bill
laughed
he
restrained
an
urge
to
ruffle
the
kid
hair
that
probably
would
have
been
resented
and
returned
to
the
others
who
was
that
richie
asked
a
friend
bill
said
he
stuffed
his
hands
in
his
pockets
do
you
remember
it
when
we
came
out
before
beverly
nodded
eddie
got
us
back
to
the
barrens
only
we
ended
up
on
the
other
side
of
the
kenduskeag
somehow
the
old
cape
side
you
and
haystack
pushed
the
lid
off
one
of
those
pumpingstation
richie
said
to
bill

most

ben
said

the
sun

out
but
it
was
almost
down
yea
bill
said
and
we
were
all
there
but
nothing

forever
richie
said
he
looked
back
down
the
hill
they
had
just
climbed
and
sighed
look
at
this
for
nstance
he
held
his
hands
out
the
tiny
scars
in
the
palms
were
gone
beverly
put
her
hands
out
ben
did
the
same
bill
added
his
all
were
dirty
but
unmarked
nothing
lasts
forever
richie
repeated
he
looked
up
at
bill
and
bill
saw
tears
cut
slowly
through
the
dirt
on
richie
cheeks
except
maybe
for
lov
ben
said
and
desire
beverly
said
how
about
friends
bill
asked
and
smiled

and
rubbing
his
eyes
ah

thank

boy
ah
say
ah
say
ah
got
to
thank
about
it
bill
put
his
hands
out
and
they
joined
theirs
with
his
and
stood
there
for
a
moment
seven
who
had
been
reduced
to
four
but
who
could
still
make
a
circle
they
looked
at
each
other
ben
was
crying
now
too
the
tears
spilling
from
his
eyes
but
he
was
smiling
i
love

so
much
he
said
he
squeezed
bev
and
richie
hands
tighttighttight
for
a
moment
and
then
dropped
them

place

bill
said
they
walked
into
the
town
house
on
a
wave
of
laughter
and
as
bill
pushed
through
the
glass
door
beverly
caught
sight
of
something
which
she
never
spoke
of
but
never
forgot
for
just
a
moment
she
saw
their
reflections
in
the
glass
only
there
were
six
not
four
because
eddie
was
behind
richie
and
stan
was
behind
bill
that
little
halfsmile
on
his
face
out
/
dusk
august
th
the
sun
sits
neatly
on
the
horizon
a
slightly
oblate
red
ball
that
throws
a
flat
feverish
light
over
the
barrens
the
iron
cover
on
top
of
one
of
the
pumpingstations
rises
a
little
settles
rises
again
and
begins
to
slide
pppush
it
buhben
it
bruhbreaking
my
shoulder
the
cover
slides
farther
tilts
and
falls
into
the
shrubbery
that
has
grown
up
around
the
concrete
cylinder
seven
children
come
out
one
by
one
and
look
around
blinking
owlishly
in
silent
wonder
they
are
like
children
who
have
never
seen
daylight
before
tt
so
quie
beverly
says
softly
the
only
sounds
are
the
loud
rush
of
water
and
the
somnolent
hum
of
insects
the
storm
is
over
but
the
kenduskeag
is
still
very
high
closer
to
town
not
far
from
the
place
where
the
river
is
corseted
in
concrete
and
called
a
canal
it
has
overflowed
its
banks
although
the
flooding
is
by
no
means
serious
a
few
wet
cellars
is
the
worst
of
it
this
time
stan
moves
away
from
them
his
face
blank
and
thoughtful
bill
looks
around
and
at
first
he
thinks
stan
has
seen
a
small
fire
on
the
riverbank
fire
is
his
first
impression
ared
glow
almost
too
bright
to
look
at
but
when
stan
picks
the
fire
up
in
his
right
hand
the
angle
of
the
light
changes
and
bill
sees
it
nothing
but
a
coke
bottle
one
of
the
new
clear
ones
which
someone
has
dropped
by
the
river
he
watches
as
stan
reverses
it
holds
it
by
the
neck
and
brings
it
down
on
a
shelf
of
rock
jutting
out
of
the
bank
the
bottle
breaks
and
bill
is
aware
they
are
all
watching
stan
now
as
he
pokes
through
the
shattered
remains
of
the
bottle
his
face
sober
and
studious
and
absorbed
at
last
he
picks
up
a
narrow
wedge
of
glass
the
westering
sun
throws
red
glints
from
it
and
bill
thinks
again
like
a
fire
stan
looks
up
at
him
and
bill
suddenly
understands
it
is
perfectly
clear
to
him
and
perfectly
right
he
steps
forward
toward
stan
with
his
hands
held
out
palms
up
stan
backs
away
into
the
water
small
black
bugs
stitch
along
just
above
the
surface
and
bill
can
see
an
iridescent
dragonfly
go
bussing
off
into
the
reeds
along
the
far
bank
like
a
small
flying
rainbow
a
frog
begins
a
steady
bass
thud
and
as
stan
takes
his
left
hand
and
draws
the
edge
of
glass
down
his
palm
peeling
skin
and
bringing
thin
blood
bill
thinks
in
a
kind
of
ecstasy
there
so
much
life
down
here
bill
sure
both
stan
cuts
his
other
hand
there
is
pain
but
not
much
a
whippoorwill
has
begun
to
call
somewhere
a
cool
sound
peaceful
bill
thinks
that
whippoorwill
is
raising
the
moon
he
looks
at
his
hands
both
of
them
bleeding
now
and
then
around
him
the
others
are
there
eddie
with
his
aspirator
clutched
tightly
in
one
hand
ben
with
his
big
belly
pushing
palely
out
through
the
tattered
remains
of
his
shirt
richie
his
face
oddly
naked
without
his
glasses
mike
silent
and
solemn
his
normally
full
lips
compressed
to
a
thin
line
and
beverly
her
head
up
her
eyes
wide
and
clear
her
hair
still
somehow
lovely
in
spite
of
the
dirt
that
mats
it
all
of
us
all
of
us
are
here
and
he
sees
them
really
sees
them
for
the
last
time
because
in
some
way
he
understands
that
they
will
never
all
be
together
again
the
seven
of
them
not
this
way
no
one
talks
beverly
holds
out
her
hands
and
after
a
moment
richie
and
ben
hold
out
theirs
mike
and
eddie
do
the
same
stan
cuts
them
one
by
one
as
the
sun
begins
to
slip
behind
the
horizon
cooling
that
red
furnaceglow
to
a
dusky
rosepink
the
whippoorwill
cries
again
bill
can
see
the
first
faint
swirls
of
mist
on
the
water
and
he
feels
as
if
he
has
become
a
part
of
everything
this
is
a
brief
ecstasy
which
he
will
no
more
talk
about
than
beverly
will
later
talk
about
the
brief
reflection
she
sees
of
two
dead
men
who
were
as
boys
her
friends
a
breeze
touches
the
trees
and
bushes
making
them
sigh
and
he
thinks
this
is
a
lovely
place
and
i'll
never
forget
it
it
lovely
and
they
are
lovely
each
one
of
them
is
gorgeous
the
whippoorwill
cries
again
sweet
and
liquid
and
for
a
moment
bill
feels
at
one
with
it
as
if
he
could
sing
and
then
be
gone
into
the
dusk
as
if
he
could
fly
away
brave
in
the
air
he
looks
at
beverly
and
she
is
smiling
at
him
she
closes
her
eyes
and
holds
her
hands
out
to
either
side
bill
takes
her
left
ben
her
right
bill
can
feel
the
warmth
of
her
blood
mixing
with
his
own
the
others
join
in
and
they
stand
in
a
circle
all
of
their
hands
now
sealed
in
that
peculiarly
intimate
way
stan
is
looking
at
bill
with
a
kind
of
urgency
a
kind
of
fear
swuhswear
to
muhme
that
you'll
ccccome
buhbac
bill
says
swear
to
me
that
if
ih
thit
isn't
dddead
you'll
cuhhome
back
swea
ben
said
swear
richie
yes
i
swear
bev
swear
it
mike
hanlon
mutters
yeah
swear
eddie
his
voice
a
thin
and
reedy
whisper
swear
to
stan
whispers
but
his
voice
falters
and
he
looks
down
as
he
speaks
ei
swuhswuhswear
that
was
it
that
was
all
but
they
stand
there
for
awhile
longer
feeling
the
power
that
is
in
their
circle
the
closed
body
that
they
make
the
light
paints
their
faces
in
pale
fading
colors
the
sun
is
now
gone
and
sunset
is
dying
they
stand
together
in
a
circle
as
the
darkness
creeps
down
into
the
barrens
filling
up
the
paths
they
have
walked
this
summer
the
clearings
where
they
have
played
tag
and
guns
the
secret
places
along
the
riverbanks
where
they
have
sat
and
discussed
childhood
long
questions
or
smoked
beverly
cigarettes
or
where
they
have
merely
been
silent
watching
the
passage
of
the
clouds
reflected
in
the
water
the
eye
of
the
day
is
closing
at
last
ben
drops
his
hands
he
starts
to
say
something
shakes
his
head
and
walks
away
richie
follows
him
then
beverly
and
mike
walking
together
no
one
talks
they
climb
the
embankment
to
kansas
street
and
simply
take
leave
of
one
another
and
when
bill
thinks
it
over
twentyseven
years
later
he
realizes
that
they
really
never
did
all
get
together
again
four
of
them
quite
often
sometimes
five
and
maybe
six
once
or
twice
but
never
all
seven
he
the
last
to
go
he
stands
for
a
long
time
with
his
hands
on
the
rickety
white
fence
looking
down
into
the
barrens
as
overhead
the
first
stars
seed
the
summer
sky
he
stands
under
the
blue
and
over
the
black
and
watches
the
barrens
fill
up
with
darkness
i
never
want
to
play
down
there
again
he
thinks
suddenly
and
is
amazed
to
find
the
thought
is
not
terrible
or
distressing
but
tremendously
liberating
he
stands
there
a
moment
longer
and
then
turns
away
from
the
barrens
and
starts
home
walking
along
the
dark
sidewalk
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
glancing
from
time
to
time
at
the
houses
of
derry
warmly
lit
against
the
night
after
a
block
or
two
he
begins
to
walk
faster
thinking
of
supper
and
a
block
or
two
after
that
he
begins
to
whistle
derry
the
last
interlude
the
ocean
in
these
times
is
a
perfect
fleet
of
ships
and
we
can
hardly
fail
to
encounter
many
in
running
over
it
is
merely
crossing
said
mr
micawber
trifling
with
his
eyeglass
merely
crossing
the
distance
is
quite
imaginary

june
th
bill
came
in
about
twenty
minutes
ago
and
brought
me
this
book
carole
found
it
on
one
of
the
tables
in
the
library
and
gave
it
to
him
when
he
asked
for
it
i
thought
chief
rademacher
might
have
taken
it
but
apparently
he
didn't
want
anything
to
do
with
it
bill
stutter
is
disappearing
again
but
the
poor
man
has
aged
four
years
in
the
last
four
days
he
told
me
he
expects
audra
to
be
discharged
from
derry
home
hospital
where
i
myself
yet
tarry
tomorrow
only
to
take
a
private
ambulance
north
to
the
bangor
mental
health
institute
physically
she
fine
minor
cuts
and
bruises
that
are
already
healing
mentally
you
raise
her
hand
and
it
stays
up
bill
said
he
was
sitting
by
the
window
twiddling
a
can
of
diet
soda
between
his
hands
it
just
floats
there
until
someone
puts
it
down
again
her
reflexes
are
there
but
very
slow
the
eeg
they
did
shows
a
severely
repressed
alpha
wave
she
cccatatonic
mike
i
said
tve
got
an
idea
maybe
not
such
a
good
one
if
you
don't
like
it
just
say
so
what
tm
going
to
be
in
here
another
week
i
said
instead
of
sending
audra
up
to
bangor
why
don't
you
take
her
to
my
place
bill
spend
the
week
with
her
talk
to
her
even
if
she
doesn't
talk
back
is
she
is
she
continent
n
bill
said
bleakly
can
you
i
mean
would
you
would
i
change
her
he
smiled
and
it
was
such
a
painful
smile
that
i
had
to
look
away
for
a
moment
it
was
the
way
my
father
smiled
the
time
he
told
me
about
butch
bowers
and
the
chickens
yes
i
think
i
could
do
that
much
won't
tell
you
to
take
it
easy
on
yourself
when
you're
obviously
not
prepared
to
do
that
i
said
but
please
remember
that
you
yourself
agreed
that
much
or
all
of
what
happened
was
almost
certainly
ordained
that
may
include
audra
part
in
this
sh
should
have
kept
my
mouth
shut
about
where
i
was
ggoing
sometimes
it
better
to
say
nothing
so
that
what
i
did
all
right
he
said
at
last
if
you
really
mean
it
i
mean
it
they've
got
ny
housekeys
down
at
the
patient
services
desk
there
a
couple
of
delmonico
steaks
in
the
freezer
maybe
that
was
ordained
too
she
eating
mostly
soft
foods
and
uh
luhliquids
well
i
said
holding
onto
my
smile
maybe
there'll
be
cause
for
a
cekbration
there
a
pretty
good
bottle
of
wine
on
the
top
shelf
in
the
pantry
too
mondavi
domestic
but
good
he
came
over
and
gripped
my
hand
thank
you
mike
any
time
big
bill
he
let
go
of
my
hand
richie
flew
back
to
california
this
morning
i
nodded
think
you'll
stay
in
touch
m
maybe
he
said
for
awhile
anyway
but
he
looked
at
me
levelly
it
going
to
happen
again
i
think
the
forgetting
yes
in
fact
i
think
it
already
started
just
little
things
so
far
details
but
i
think
it
going
to
spread
maybe
that
best
maybe
he
looked
out
the
window
still
twiddling
his
can
of
diet
soda
almost
surely
thinking
about
his
wife
so
wideeyed
and
silent
and
beautiful
and
plastic
catatonic
the
sound
of
a
door
slamming
shut
and
locked
he
sighed
maybe
it
is
ben
beverly
he
looked
back
at
me
and
smiled
a
little
ben
invited
her
to
come
back
to
nebraska
with
him
and
she
agreed
to
go
at
least
for
awhile
you
know
about
her
friend
in
chicago
i
nodded
beverly
told
ben
and
ben
told
me
yesterday
if
i
may
understate
the
case
grotesquely
understate
the
case
beverly
later
description
of
her
wonderful
fantastic
husband
tom
was
much
truer
than
her
original
one
wonderful
fantastic
tom
kept
bev
in
emotional
spiritual
and
sometimes
physical
bondage
for
the
last
four
years
or
so
wonderful
fantastic
tom
got
here
by
beating
the
information
out
of
bev
only
close
woman
friend
she
told
me
she
going
to
fly
back
to
chicago
the
week
after
next
and
file
a
missing
persons
report
on
him
tom
i
mean
smart
enough
i
said
no
one
ever
going
to
find
him
down
there
or
eddie
either
i
thought
but
did
not
say
no
i
suppose
not
bill
said
and
when
she
goes
back
i'm
betting
ben
will
go
with
her
and
you
know
something
else
something
really
crazy
what
i
don't
think
she
really
remembers
what
happened
to
tom
i
just
stared
at
him
she
forgotten
or
forgetting
bill
said
and
i
can't
remember
what
the
doorway
looked
like
anymore
the
d
doorway
into
its
place
i
try
to
think
of
it
and
the
craziest
thing
happens
i
get
this
ihimage
of
gggoats
walking
over
a
bridge
from
that
story
the
three
billy
goats
gruff
crazy
huh
they'll
trace
tom
rogan
to
derry
eventually
i
said
he'll
have
left
a
paper
trail
a
mile
wide
rentacar
plane
tickets
tm
not
so
sure
of
that
bill
said
lighting
a
cigarette
i
think
he
might
have
paid
cash
for
his
plane
ticket
and
given
a
phony
name
maybe
bought
a
cheap
car
here
or
stole
one
wh
oh
come
o
bill
said
do
you
think
he
came
all
this
way
to
give
her
a
spanking
our
eyes
met
for
a
long
moment
and
then
he
stood
up
listen
mike

too
hip
gotta
split
i
said
i
can
dig
it
he
laughed
at
that
laughed
hard
and
when
he
had
sobered
he
said
thanks
for
the
use
of
your
place
mikey
tm
not
going
to
swear
to
you
itll
make
any
difference
it
has
no
therapeutic
qualities
that
i'm
aware
of
well
i'll
see
you
he
did
an
odd
thing
then
odd
but
rather
lovely
he
kissed
my
cheek
god
bless
mike
i'll
be
around
things
may
be
okay
bill
i
said
don't
give
up
hope
they
may
be
okay
he
smiled
and
nodded
but
i
think
the
same
word
was
in
both
of
our
minds
catatonic
june
sth
ben
and
beverly
came
in
today
to
say
goodbye
they're
not
flying
ben
rented
a
great
big
cadillac
from
the
hertz
people
and
they're
going
to
drive
not
hurrying
there
something
in
their
eyes
when
they
look
at
each
other
and
i'd
bet
my
pension
plan
that
if
they're
not
making
it
now
they
will
be
by
the
time
they
get
to
nebraska
beverly
hugged
me
told
me
to
get
well
quickly
and
then
cried
ben
also
hugged
me
and
asked
for
the
third
or
fourth
time
if
i
would
write
i
told
him
i
would
indeed
write
and
so
i
will
for
awhile
at
least
because
this
tune
it
happening
to
me
as
well
i'm
forgetting
things
as
bill
said
right
now
it
only
small
things
details
but
it
feels
like
the
sort
of
thing
that
going
to
spread
it
could
be
that
in
a
month
or
a
year
this
notebook
will
be
all
i'll
have
to
remind
me
of
what
happened
here
in
derry
i
suppose
the
words
themselves
might
begin
to
fade
eventually
leaving
this
book
as
blank
as
when
i
first
picked
it
up
in
the
schooł
supplies
department
at
freese
that
an
awful
thought
and
in
the
daytime
it
seems
wildly
paranoid
but
do
you
know
in
the
watches
of
the
night
it
seems
perfectly
logical
this
forgetting
the
prospect
fills
me
with
panic
but
it
also
offers
a
sneaking
sort
of
relief
it
suggests
to
me
more
than
anything
else
that
this
time
they
really
did
kill
it
that
there
is
no
need
of
a
watchman
to
stand
and
wait
for
the
cycle
to
begin
again
dull
panic
sneaking
relief
it
the
relief
i'll
embrace
i
think
sneaking
or
not
bill
called
to
say
he
and
audra
had
moved
in
there
is
no
change
in
her
ti
always
remember
you
that
what
beverly
told
me
just
before
she
and
ben
left
i
think
i
saw
a
different
truth
in
her
eyes
june
th
interesting
piece
in
the
derry
news
today
on
page
one
the
story
was
headed
storm
causes
henley
to
give
up
auditorium
expansion
Łans
the
henley
in
question
is
tim
henley
a
multimillionaire
developer
who
came
into
derry
like
a
whirlwind
in
the
late
sixties
it
was
henley
and
zitner
who
organized
the
consortium
responsible
for
building
the
derry
mall
which
according
to
another
piece
on
page
one
is
probably
going
to
be
declared
a
total
loss
tim
henley
was
determined
to
see
derry
grow
there
was
a
profitmotive
yes
indeed
but
there
was
more
to
it
than
that
henley
genuinely
wanted
to
see
it
happen
his
sudden
aban
donment
of
the
auditorium
expansion
suggests
several
things
to
me
that
henley
may
have
soured
on
derry
is
only
the
most
obvious
i
think
it
also
possible
that
he
in
the
process
of
losing
his
shirt
because
of
the
destruction
of
the
mall
but
the
article
also
suggests
that
henley
is
not
alone
that
other
investors
and
potential
investors
in
derry
future
may
be
rethinking
their
options
of
course
al
zitner
won't
have
to
bother
god
retired
him
when
downtown
collapsed
of
the
others
those
who
thought
like
henley
are
now
facing
a
rather
difficult
problem
how
do
you
rebuild
an
urban
area
which
is
now
at
least
fifty
percent
underwater
i
think
that
after
a
long
and
ghoulishly
vital
existence
derry
may
be
dying
like
a
nightshade
whose
time
to
bloom
has
come
and
gone
called
bill
denbrough
late
this
afternoon
no
change
in
audra
an
hour
ago
i
put
through
another
call
this
one
to
richie
tozier
in
california
his
answering
machine
fielded
the
call
with
creedence
clearwater
revival
music
playing
in
the
background
those
machines
always
fuck
up
my
timing
somehow
i
left
my
name
and
number
hesitated
and
added
that
i
hoped
he
was
able
to
wear
his
contact
lenses
again
i
was
about
to
hang
up
when
richie
himself
picked
up
the
phone
and
said
mikey
how
you
be
his
voice
was
pleased
and
warm
but
there
was
an
obvious
bewilderment
there
as
well
he
was
wearing
the
verbal
expression
of
a
man
who
has
been
caught
utterly
flat
footed
hello
richie
i
said
t'm
doing
pretty
well
good
how
much
pain
you
having
some
its
going
away
the
itch
is
worse
i'll
be
damn
glad
when
they
finally
decide
to
unstrap
my
ribs
by
the
way
i
liked
the
creedence
richie
laughed
shit
that
ain't
creedence
that
rock
and
roll
girls
from
fogarty
new
album
centerfield
it
called
you
haven't
heard
any
of
it
hubuh
you
got
to
get
it
it
great
it
just
like
he
trailed
off
for
a
moment
and
then
said
it
just
like
the
old
days
til
pick
it
up
i
said
and
i
probably
will
i
always
liked
john
fogarty
green
rive
was
my
alltune
creedence
favorite
i
guess
get
back
home
he
says
just
before
the
fade
he
says
it
what
about
bill
he
and
audra
are
keeping
house
for
me
while
i'm
in
here
good
that
good
he
paused
for
a
monent
you
want
to
hear
something
fucking
bizarre
ole
mikey
sur
i
said
i
had
a
pretty
good
idea
what
he
was
going
to
say
well
i
was
sitting
here
in
my
study
listening
to
some
of
the
new
cashbox
hot
prospects
going
over
some
ad
copy
reading
memos
there
about
two
mountains
of
stuff
backed
up
and
i'm
looking
at
roughly
a
month
of
twentyfivehour
days
so
i
had
the
answering
machine
turned
on
but
with
the
volume
turned
up
so
i
could
intercept
the
calls
i
wanted
and
just
let
the
dimwits
talk
to
the
tape
and
the
reason
i
let
you
talk
to
the
tape
as
long
as
i
did
was
because
at
first
you
didn't
have
the
slightest
idea
who
i
was
jesus
that
right
how
did
you
know
that
because
we're
forgetting
again
all
of
us
this
time
mikey
are
you
sure
what
was
stan
last
name
i
asked
him
there
was
silence
on
the
other
end
of
the
line
a
long
silence
in
it
faintly
i
could
hear
a
woman
talking
in
omaha
or
maybe
she
was
in
ruthven
arizona
or
flint
michigan
i
heard
her
as
faint
as
a
spacetraveller
leaving
the
solar
system
in
the
nosecone
of
a
burned
out
rocket
thank
someone
for
the
cookies
then
richie
said
uncertainly
i
think
it
was
underwood
but
that
isn't
jewish
it
it
tt
was
uris
uris
richie
cried
sounding
both
relieved
and
shaken
jesus
i
hate
it
when
i
get
something
right
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
and
can't
quite
pick
it
off
someone
brings
out
a
trivial
pursuit
game
i
say
excuse
me
but
i
think
the
diarrhea
coming
back
so
maybe
i'll
just
go
home
okay
but
you
remember
anyhow
mikey
like
before
no
i
looked
it
up
in
my
address
book
another
long
silence
then
you
didn't
remember
nope
no
shit
no
shit
then
this
tune
it
really
over
he
said
and
the
relief
in
his
voice
was
unmistakable
yes
i
think
so
that
longdistance
silence
fell
again
all
the
miles
between
maine
and
california
i
believe
we
were
both
thinking
the
same
thing
it
was
over
yes
and
in
six
weeks
or
six
months
we
will
have
forgotten
all
about
each
other
it
over
and
all
it
cost
us
is
our
friendship
and
stan
and
eddie
lives
i've
almost
forgotten
them
you
know
it
horrible
as
it
may
sound
i
have
almost
forgotten
stan
and
eddie
was
it
asthma
eddie
had
or
chronic
migraine
i'll
be
damned
if
i
can
remember
for
sure
although
i
think
it
was
migraine
i'll
ask
bill
he'll
know
well
you
say
hi
to
bill
and
that
pretty
wife
of
his
richie
said
with
a
cheeriness
that
sounded
canned
will
richie
i
said
closing
my
eyes
and
rubbing
my
forehead
he
remembered
bill
wife
was
in
derry
but
not
her
name
or
what
had
happened
to
her
and
if
you're
ever
in
la
you
got
the
number
we'll
get
together
and
mouth
some
chow
sure
i
felt
hot
tears
behind
my
eyes
and
if
you
get
back
this
way
the
same
thing
goes
mikey
right
here
i
love
you
man
same
here
okay
keep
your
thumb
on
it
beep
beep
richie
he
laughed
yeah
yeah
yeah
stick
it
in
your
ear
mike
ah
say
in
yo
ear
boy
he
hung
up
and
so
did
i
then
i
lay
back
on
my
pillows
with
my
eyes
shut
and
didn't
open
them
for
a
long
time
june
th
police
chief
andrew
rademacher
who
took
over
from
chief
borton
in
the
late
sixties
is
dead
it
was
a
bizarre
accident
one
i
can't
help
associating
with
what
has
been
happening
in
derry
what
has
just
ended
in
derry
the
combination
policestation
courthouse
stands
on
the
edge
of
the
area
that
fell
into
the
canal
and
while
it
didn't
go
the
upheaval
or
the
flood
must
have
caused
structural
damage
of
which
no
one
was
aware
rademacher
was
working
late
in
his
office
last
night
the
story
in
the
paper
says
as
he
has
every
night
since
the
storm
and
the
flood
the
police
chiefs
office
has
moved
from
the
third
to
the
fifth
floor
since
the
old
days
to
just
below
an
attic
where
all
sorts
of
records
and
useless
city
artifacts
are
stored
one
of
those
artifacts
was
the
trampchair
i
have
described
earlier
in
these
pages
it
was
made
of
iron
and
weighed
better
than
four
hundred
pounds
the
building
shipped
a
quantity
of
water
during
the
downpour
of
may
st
and
that
must
have
weakened
the
attic
floor
or
so
the
paper
says
whatever
the
reason
the
trampchair
fell
from
the
attic
directly
onto
chief
rademacher
as
he
sat
at
his
desk
reading
accident
reports
he
was
killed
instantly
officer
bruce
andeen
rushed
in
and
found
him
lying
on
the
ruins
of
his
shattered
desk
his
pen
still
in
one
hand
talked
to
bill
on
the
phone
again
audra
is
taking
some
solid
food
he
says
but
otherwise
there
is
no
change
i
asked
him
if
eddie
big
problem
had
been
asthma
or
migraine
asthma
he
said
promptly
don't
you
remember
his
aspirator
sure
i
said
and
did
but
only
when
bill
mentioned
it
mik
yea
what
was
his
last
name
i
looked
at
my
address
book
lying
on
the
nighttable
but
didn't
pick
it
up
i
don't
quite
remember
tt
was
like
kerkorian
bill
said
sounding
distressed
but
that
wasn't
quite
it
you've
got
everything
written
down
though
right
right
i
said
thank
god
for
that
have
you
had
any
ideas
about
audra
one
he
said
but
it
so
crazy
i
don't
want
to
talk
about
it
you
sure
yeah
all
right
mike
it
scary
isn't
it
forgetting
like
this
ye
i
said
and
it
is
june
sth
raytheon
which
had
been
scheduled
to
break
ground
on
its
derry
plant
in
july
has
decided
at
the
last
minute
to
build
in
waterville
instead
the
editorial
on
page
one
of
the
news
expresses
dismay
and
if
i
read
correctly
between
the
lines
a
little
fright
i
think
i
know
what
bill
idea
is
he'll
have
to
act
quickly
before
the
last
of
the
magic
departs
this
place
if
it
hasn't
already
i
guess
what
i
thought
before
wasn't
so
paranoid
after
all
the
names
and
addresses
of
the
others
in
my
little
book
are
fading
the
color
and
quality
of
the
ink
combine
to
make
those
entries
look
as
if
they
were
written
fifty
or
seventyfive
years
before
the
others
i've
jotted
in
there
this
has
happened
in
the
last
four
or
five
days
i'm
convinced
that
by
september
their
names
will
be
utterly
gone
i
suppose
i
could
preserve
them
i
could
just
keep
copying
them
but
i'm
also
convinced
that
each
would
fade
in
its
turn
and
that
very
soon
it
would
become
an
exercise
in
futility
like
writing
j
will
not
throw
spitballs
in
class
five
hundred
times
i
would
be
writing
names
that
meant
nothing
for
a
reason
i
didn't
remember
let
it
go
let
it
go
bill
act
quickly
but
be
careful
june
th
woke
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
from
a
terrible
nightmare
i
couldn't
remember
got
panicky
couldn't
breathe
reached
for
the
callbutton
and
then
couldn't
use
it
had
a
terrible
vision
of
mark
lamonica
answering
the
bell
with
a
hypo
or
henry
bowers
with
his
switchblade
i
grabbed
my
address
book
and
called
ben
hanscom
in
nebraska
the
address
and
number
have
faded
still
more
but
they
are
still
legible
no
go
joe
got
a
recorded
phone
company
voice
telling
me
service
to
that
number
has
been
cancelled
was
ben
fat
or
did
he
have
something
like
a
club
foot
lay
awake
until
dawn
june
th
they
tell
me
i
can
go
home
tomorrow
i
called
bill
and
told
him
that
i
suppose
i
wanted
to
warn
him
that
his
time
is
getting
shorter
all
the
time
bill
is
the
only
one
i
remember
clearly
and
i'm
convinced
that
i'm
the
only
one
he
remembers
clearly
because
we
are
both
still
here
in
derry
i
suppose
all
right
he
said
by
tomorrow
we'll
be
out
of
your
hair
you
still
got
your
idea
yeah
looks
like
it
time
to
try
it
be
careful
he
laughed
and
said
something
i
both
do
and
don't
understand
you
can't
be
¢ccareful
on
a
skuhhateboard
man
how
will
i
know
how
it
turned
out
bill
you'll
know
he
said
and
hung
up
my
heart
with
you
bill
no
matter
how
it
turns
out
my
heart
is
with
all
of
them
and
i
think
that
even
if
we
forget
each
other
we'll
remember
in
our
dreams
i'm
almost
done
with
this
diary
now
and
i
suppose
a
diary
is
all
that
it
will
ever
be
and
that
the
story
of
derry
old
scandals
and
eccentricities
has
no
place
outside
these
pages
that
fine
with
me
i
think
that
when
they
let
me
out
of
here
tomorrow
it
might
finally
be
time
to
start
thinking
about
some
sort
of
new
life
although
just
what
that
might
be
is
unclear
to
me
i
loved
you
guys
you
know
i
loved
you
so
much

on
a

man
some
kid
noon
of
a
summer
day
bill
stood
naked
in
mike
hanlon
bedroom
looking
at
his
lean
body
in
the
mirror
on
the
door
his
bald
head
gleamed
in
the
light
which
fell
through
the
window
and
cast
his
shadow
along
the
floor
and
up
the
wall
his
chest
was
hairless
his
thighs
and
shanks
skinny
but
overlaid
with
ropes
of
muscle
still
he
thought
it
an
adult
body
we
got
here
no
question
about
that
there
the
pot
belly
that
comes
with
a
few
too
many
good
steaks
a
few
too
many
bottles
of
kirin
beer
a
few
too
many
poolside
lunches
where
you
had
the
reuben
or
the
french
dip
instead
of
the
diet
plate
your
seat
dropped
too
bill
old
buddy
you
can
still
serve
an
ace
if
you're
not
too
hung
over
and
if
your
eye
in
but
you
can't
hustle
after
the
old
dunlop
the
way
you
could
when
you
were
seventeen
you
got
love
handles
and
your
balls
are
starting
to
get
that
middleaged
dangly
look
there
lines
on
your
face
that
weren't
there
when
you
were
seventeen
hell
they
weren't
there
on
your
first
author
photo
the
one
where
you
tried
so
hard
to
look
as
if
you
knew
something
anything
you're
too
old
for
what
you've
got
in
mind
billyboy
you'll
kill
both
of
you
he
put
on
his
underpants
if
we'd
believed
that
we
never
could
have
have
done
whatever
it
was
we
did
because
he
didn't
really
remember
what
it
was
they
had
done
or
what
had
happened
to
turn
audra
into
a
catatonic
wreck
he
only
knew
what
he
was
supposed
to
do
now
and
he
knew
that
if
he
didn't
do
it
now
he
would
forget
that
too
audra
was
sitting
downstairs
in
mike
easy
chair
her
hair
hanging
lankly
to
her
shoulders
staring
with
rapt
attention
at
the
tv
which
was
currently
showing
dialing
for
dollars
she
didn't
speak
and
would
only
move
if
you
led
her
this
is
different
you're
just
too
old
man
believe
it
i
won't
then
die
here
in
derry
big
fucking
deal
he
put
on
athletic
socks
the
one
pair
of
jeans
he
had
brought
the
tank
top
he'd
bought
at
the
shirt
shack
in
bangor
the
day
before
the
tank
was
bright
orange
across
the
front
it
said
where
the
hell
is
derry
maine
he
sat
down
on
mike
bed
the
one
he
had
shared
for
the
last
week
of
nights
with
his
warm
but
corpselike
wife
and
put
on
his
sneakers
a
pair
of
keds
which
he
had
also
bought
yesterday
in
bangor
he
stood
up
and
looked
at
himself
in
the
mirror
again
he
saw
a
man
pressing
middle
age
dressed
up
in
a
kid
clothes
you
look
ludicrous
what
kid
doesn't
you're
no
kid
give
this
up
fuck
let
rock
and
roll
a
little
bill
said
softly
and
left
the
room
in
the
dreams
he
will
have
in
later
years
he
is
always
leaving
derry
alone
at
sunset
the
town
is
deserted
everyone
has
left
the
theological
seminary
and
the
victorian
houses
on
west
broadway
brood
black
against
a
lurid
sky
every
summer
sunset
you
ever
saw
rolled
up
into
one
he
can
hear
his
footfalls
echoing
back
as
they
rap
along
the
concrete
the
only
other
sound
is
water
rushing
hollowly
through
the
stormdrains
he
rolled
silver
out
into
the
driveway
put
him
on
the
kickstand
and
checked
the
tires
again
the
front
one
was
okay
but
the
back
one
felt
a
little
mushy
he
got
the
bike
pump
that
mike
had
bought
and
firmed
it
up
when
he
put
the
pump
back
he
checked
the
playing
cards
and
the
clothespins
the
bike
wheels
still
made
those
exciting
machinegun
sounds
bill
remembered
from
his
boyhood
good
deal
you've
gone
crazy
maybe
we'll
see
he
went
back
into
mike
garage
again
got
the
inl
and
oiled
the
chain
and
sprocket
then
he
stood
up
looked
at
silver
and
gave
the
bulb
of
the
oogahhor
a
light
experimental
squeeze
it
sounded
good
he
nodded
and
went
into
the
house
and
he
sees
all
those
places
again
intact
as
they
were
then
the
hulking
brick
fort
of
derry
elementary
the
kissing
bridge
with
its
complex
intaglio
of
initials
highschool
sweethearts
ready
to
crack
the
world
open
with
their
passion
who
had
grown
up
to
become
insurance
agents
and
car
salesmen
and
waitresses
and
beauticians
he
sees
the
statue
of
paul
bunyan
against
that
bleeding
sunset
sky
and
the
leaning
white
fence
which
ran
along
the
kansas
street
sidewalk
at
the
edge
of
the
barrens
he
sees
them
as
they
were
as
they
always
will
be
in
some
part
of
his
mind
and
his
heart
breaks
with
love
and
honor
leaving
leaving
derry
he
thinks
we
are
leaving
derry
and
if
this
was
a
story
it
would
be
the
last
halfdozen
pages
or
so
get
ready
to
put
this
one
up
on
the
shelf
and
forget
it
the
sun
going
down
and
there
no
sound
but
my
footfalls
and
the
water
in
the
drains
this
is
the
time
of
dialing
for
dollars
had
given
way
to
wheel
of
fortune
audra
sat
passively
in
front
of
it
her
eyes
never
leaving
the
set
her
demeanor
did
not
change
when
bill
snapped
the
tv
off
audr
he
said
going
to
her
and
taking
her
hand
come
on
she
didn't
move
her
hand
lay
in
his
warm
wax
bill
took
her
other
hand
from
the
arm
of
mike
chair
and
pulled
her
to
her
feet
he
had
dressed
her
that
morning
much
as
he
had
dressed
himself
she
was
wearing
levis
and
a
blue
shell
top
she
would
have
looked
quite
lovely
if
not
for
her
wideeyed
vacant
stare
cuhcome
o
he
said
again
and
led
her
through
the
door
into
mike
kitchen
and
eventually
outside
she
came
willingly
enough
although
she
would
have
plunged
off
the
back
porch
stoop
and
gone
sprawling
in
the
dirt
if
bill
had
not
put
an
arm
around
her
waist
and
guided
her
down
the
steps
he
led
her
over
to
where
silver
stood
heeled
over
on
his
kickstand
in
he
bright
summer
noonlight
audra
stood
beside
the
bike
looking
serenely
at
the
side
of
mike
garage
get
on
audra
she
didn't
move
patiently
bill
worked
at
getting
her
to
swing
one
of
her
long
legs
over
the
carrier
mounted
on
silver
back
fender
at
last
she
stood
there
with
the
package
carrier
between
her
legs
not
quite
touching
her
crotch
bill
pressed
his
hand
lightly
to
the
top
of
her
head
and
audra
sat
down
he
swung
onto
silver
saddle
and
put
up
the
kickstand
with
his
heel
he
prepared
to
reach
behind
him
for
audra
hands
and
draw
them
around
his
middle
but
before
he
could
do
it
they
crept
around
him
of
their
own
accord
like
small
dazed
mice
he
looked
down
at
them
his
heart
beating
faster
seeming
to
pump
in
his
throat
as
much
as
in
his
chest
it
was
the
first
independent
action
audra
had
taken
all
week
so
far
as
he
knew
the
first
independent
action
she
had
taken
since
/t
happened
whatever
/t
had
been
audra
there
was
no
answer
he
tried
to
crane
his
neck
around
and
see
her
but
couldn't
quite
make
it
there
were
only
her
hands
around
his
waist
the
nails
showing
the
last
chips
of
a
red
polish
that
had
been
put
on
by
a
bright
lively
talented
young
woman
in
a
small
english
town
we're
going
for
a
ride
bill
said
and
he
began
to
roll
silver
forward
toward
palmer
lane
listening
to
the
gravel
crunch
under
the
tires
i
want
you
to
hold
on
audra
i
think
i
think
i
may
go
sort
of
f
f
fast
if
i
don't
lose
my
guts
he
thought
of
the
kid
he
had
met
earlier
during
his
stay
in
derry
when
zt
had
still
been
happening
you
can't
be
careful
on
a
skateboard
the
kid
had
said
truer
words
were
never
spoken
kid
audra
you
ready
no
answer
had
her
hands
tightened
the
tiniest
bit
across
his
middle
probably
just
wishful
thinking
he
reached
the
end
of
the
driveway
and
looked
right
palmer
lane
ran
straight
to
upper
main
street
where
a
left
turn
would
take
him
onto
the
hill
running
downtown
downhill
picking
up
speed
he
felt
a
tremor
of
fear
at
the
image
and
a
disquieting
thought
old
bones
break
easy
billyboy
ran
through
his
mind
almost
too
quickly
to
read
and
was
gone
but
but
it
wasn't
all
disquiet
was
it
no
it
was
desire
as
well
the
feeing
he'd
had
when
he
saw
the
kid
walking
along
with
the
skateboard
under
his
arm
the
desire
to
go
fast
to
feel
the
wind
race
past
you
without
knowing
if
you
were
racing
toward
or
running
away
from
to
just
go
to
fly
disquiet
and
desire
all
the
difference
between
world
and
want
the
difference
between
being
an
adult
who
counted
the
cost
and
a
child
who
just
got
on
it
and
went
for
instance
all
the
world
between
yet
not
that
much
difference
at
all
bedfellows
really
the
way
you
felt
when
the
rollercoaster
car
approached
the
top
of
the
first
steep
grade
where
the
ride
really
begins
disquiet
and
desire
what
you
want
and
what
you're
scared
to
try
for
where
you've
been
and
where
you
want
to
go
something
in
a
rockandroll
song
about
wanting
the
girl
the
car
the
place
to
stand
and
be
oh
please
god
can
you
dig
it
bill
closed
his
eyes
for
a
moment
feeling
the
soft
dead
weight
of
his
wife
behind
him
feeling
the
hill
somewhere
ahead
of
him
feeling
his
own
heart
inside
him
be
brave
be
true
stand
he
began
to
push
silver
forward
again
you
want
to
rock
and
roll
a
little
audra
no
answer
but
that
was
all
right
he
was
ready
hold
on
then
he
began
to
pedal
it
was
hard
going
at
first
silver
wobbled
alarmingly
back
and
forth
audra
weight
adding
to
the
imbalance
yet
she
must
be
doing
some
balancing
even
unconsciously
or
they
would
have
crashed
right
away
bill
stood
on
the
pedals
hands
squeezing
the
handlegrips
with
maniacal
tightness
his
head
turned
skyward
his
eyes
slits
the
cords
on
his
neck
standing
out
gonna
fall
splat
right
here
in
the
street
split
her
skull
and
mine
no
you
ain't
go
for
it
bill
go
for
it
go
for
the
son
of
a
bitch
he
stood
on
the
pedals
revolving
them
feeing
every
cigarette
he'd
smoked
over
the
last
twenty
years
in
his
elevated
bloodpressure
and
the
race
of
his
heart
fuck
that
too
he
thought
and
the
rush
of
crazy
exhilaration
made
him
grin
the
playing
cards
which
had
been
firing
isolated
shots
now
began
to
clickclock
faster
they
were
new
nice
new
bikes
and
they
made
a
good
loud
sound
bill
felt
the
first
touch
of
breeze
on
his
bald
pate
and
his
grin
widened
i
made
that
breeze
he
thought
i
made
it
by
pumping
these
damn
pedals
the
stop
sign
at
the
end
of
the
lane
was
coming
up
bill
began
to
brake
and
then
his
grin
still
widening
showing
more
and
more
of
his
teeth
he
began
to
pump
again
ignoring
the
stop
sign
bill
denbrough
swept
to
the
left
onto
upper
main
street
above
bassey
park
again
audra
weight
fooled
him
and
they
almost
overbalanced
and
crashed
the
bike
wavered
wobbled
then
righted
itself
that
breeze
was
stronger
now
cooling
the
sweat
on
his
forehead
evaporating
it
rushing
past
his
ears
with
a
low
intoxicating
sound
that
was
a
little
like
the
sound
of
the
ocean
in
a
conch
shell
but
was
really
like
nothing
else
on
earth
bill
supposed
it
was
a
sound
the
kid
with
the
skateboard
was
familiar
with
but
it
a
sound
you'll
fall
out
of
touch
with
kid
he
thought
things
have
a
way
of
changing
it
a
dirty
trick
so
be
prepared
for
it
pedaling
faster
now
finding
a
surer
balance
in
speed
the
ruins
of
paul
bunyan
on
the
left
like
a
fallen
colossus
bill
shouted
hiyo
silver
awayyyyy
audra
hands
tightened
around
his
middle
he
felt
her
stir
against
his
back
but
there
was
no
urge
to
turn
and
try
to
see
her
now
no
urge
no
need
he
pedaled
faster
laughing
out
loud
a
tall
skinny
bald
man
on
a
bike
crouched
over
the
handlebars
to
lessen
the
wind
resistance
people
turned
to
look
as
he
raced
alongside
bassey
park
now
upper
main
street
began
to
incline
toward
the
cavedin
center
of
town
at
a
steeper
angle
and
a
voice
inside
whispered
to
him
that
if
he
didn't
brake
soon
he
would
find
himself
unable
he
would
simply
go
sweeping
into
the
sunken
remains
of
the
threeway
intersection
like
a
bat
out
of
hell
and
kill
both
of
them
instead
of
braking
he
began
to
pedal
again
urging
the
bike
to
go
even
faster
now
he
was
flying
down
main
street
hill
and
he
could
see
the
whiteandorange
crash
barriers
the
smudgepots
with
their
smoky
halloween
flames
marking
the
edge
of
the
cavein
he
could
see
the
tops
of
buildings
which
jutted
out
of
the
streets
like
the
figments
of
a
madman
imagination
hiyo
silver
awayyyyyy
bill
denbrough
cried
deliriously
and
rushed
down
the
hill
toward
whatever
there
would
be
aware
for
one
last
time
of
derry
as
his
place
aware
most
of
all
that
he
was
alive
under
a
real
sky
and
that
all
was
desire
desire
desire
he
raced
down
the
hill
on
silver
he
raced
to
beat
the
devil
leaving
so
you
leave
and
there
is
an
urge
to
look
back
to
look
back
just
once
as
the
sunset
fades
to
see
that
severe
new
england
skyline
one
final
time
the
spires
the
standpipe
paul
with
his
axe
slung
over
his
shoulder
but
it
is
perhaps
not
such
a
good
idea
to
look
back
all
the
stories
say
so
look
what
happened
to
lot
wife
best
not
to
look
back
best
to
believe
there
will
be
happily
ever
afters
all
the
way
around
and
so
there
may
be
who
is
to
say
there
will
not
be
such
endings
not
all
boats
which
sail
away
into
darkness
never
find
the
sun
again
or
the
hand
of
another
child
if
life
teaches
anything
at
all
it
teaches
that
there
are
so
many
happy
endings
that
the
man
who
believes
there
is
no
god
needs
his
rationality
called
into
serious
question
you
leave
and
you
leave
quick
when
the
sun
starts
to
go
down
he
thinks
in
this
dream
that
what
you
do
and
if
you
spare
a
last
thought
maybe
it
ghosts
you
wonder
about
the
ghosts
of
children
standing
in
the
water
at
sunset
standing
in
a
circle
standing
with
their
hands
joined
together
their
faces
young
sure
but
tough
tough
enough
anyway
to
give
birth
to
the
people
they
will
become
tough
enough
to
understand
maybe
that
the
people
they
will
become
must
necessarily
birth
the
people
they
were
before
they
can
get
on
with
trying
to
understand
simple
mortality
the
circle
closes
the
wheel
rolls
and
that
all
there
is
you
don't
have
to
look
back
to
see
those
children
part
of
your
mind
will
see
them
forever
live
with
them
forever
love
with
them
forever
they
are
not
necessarily
the
best
part
of
you
but
they
were
once
the
repository
of
all
you
could
become
children
i
love
you
i
love
you
so
much
so
drive
away
quick
drive
away
while
the
last
of
the
light
slips
away
drive
away
from
derry
from
memory
but
not
from
desire
that
stays
the
bright
cameo
of
all
we
were
and
all
we
believed
as
children
all
that
shone
in
our
eyes
even
when
we
were
lost
and
the
wind
blew
in
the
night
drive
away
and
try
to
keep
smiling
get
a
little
rock
and
roll
on
the
radio
and
go
toward
all
the
life
there
is
with
all
the
courage
you
can
find
and
all
the
belief
you
can
muster
be
true
be
brave
stand
all
the
rest
is
darkness
he
hey
mister
you
lookout
damn
fool
gonna
words
whipped
by
in
the
slipstream
as
meaningless
as
pennants
in
a
breeze
or
untethered
balloons
here
came
the
crash
barriers
he
could
smell
the
sooty
aroma
of
kerosene
from
the
smudgepots
he
saw
the
yawning
darkness
where
the
street
had
been
heard
sullen
water
rushing
down
there
in
the
tangled
darkness
and
laughed
at
the
sound
he
dragged
silver
hard
left
so
close
©
the
crash
barriers
now
that
the
leg
of
his
jeans
actually
whispered
along
one
of
them
silver
wheels
were
less
than
three
inches
from
the
place
where
the
tar
ended
in
empty
space
and
he
was
running
out
of
maneuvering
room
up
ahead
the
water
had
eroded
all
of
the
street
and
half
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
cash
jewelry
store
barriers
closed
off
what
was
left
of
the
sidewalk
it
had
been
severely
undercut
bill
it
was
audra
voice
dazed
and
a
little
thick
she
sounded
as
if
she
had
just
awakened
from
a
deep
sleep
bill
where
are
we
what
are
we
doing
'
hi
yo
silve
bill
shouted
pointing
the
rushing
gantry
that
was
silver
directly
at
the
crash
barrier
jutting
out
at
right
angles
to
the
empty
cash
show
window
hi
yo
silver
awayyyy
silver
struck
the
barrier
at
better
than
forty
miles
an
hour
and
it
went
flying
the
centerboard
in
one
direction
the
ashaped
supports
in
two
others
audra
cried
out
and
squeezed
bill
so
tightly
that
he
lost
his
breath
up
and
down
main
street
canal
street
and
kansas
street
people
stood
in
doorways
and
on
sidewalks
watching
silver
shot
out
onto
the
bridge
of
undercut
sidewalk
bill
felt
his
left
hip
and
knee
chip
the
side
of
the
jewelry
store
he
felt
silvers
rear
wheel
sag
suddenly
and
understood
that
the
sidewalk
was
falling
in
behind
them
and
then
silver
forward
motion
carried
them
back
onto
solid
roadway
bill
swerved
to
avoid
an
overturned
trashcan
and
barrelled
out
into
the
street
again
brakes
squealed
he
saw
the
grille
of
a
big
truck
approaching
and
still
couldn't
seem
to
stop
laughing
he
ran
through
the
space
the
heavy
truck
wound
up
occupying
a
full
second
before
it
got
there
shit
time
to
spare
yelling
tears
squirting
from
his
eyes
bill
blew
silver
oogahhorn
listening
to
each
hoarse
bray
embed
itself
in
the
day
bright
light
bill
you're
going
to
kill
us
both
audra
cried
out
and
although
there
was
terror
in
her
voice
she
was
also
laughing
bill
heeled
silver
over
and
this
time
he
felt
audra
leaning
with
him
making
die
bike
easier
to
control
helping
to
make
the
two
of
them
exist
with
it
at
least
for
this
small
compact
moment
of
time
as
three
living
things
do
you
think
so
he
shouted
back
i
know
s
she
cried
and
then
grabbed
his
crotch
where
there
was
a
huge
and
cheerful
erection
but
don't
stop
he
had
nothing
to
say
about
it
however
silver
speed
was
bleeding
away
on
upmile
hill
the
heavy
roar
of
the
playing
cards
becoming
single
gunshots
again
bill
stopped
and
turned
to
her
she
was
pale
wideeyed
obviously
scared
and
confused
but
awake
aware
and
laughing
audra
he
said
laughing
with
her
he
helped
her
off
silver
leaned
the
bike
against
a
handy
brick
wall
and
embraced
her
he
kissed
her
forehead
her
eyes
her
cheeks
her
mouth
her
neck
her
breasts
she
hugged
him
while
he
did
it
bill
what
been
happening
i
remember
getting
off
the
plane
at
bangor
and
i
can't
remember
a
thing
after
that
are
you
all
right
yes
am
i
yes
now
she
pushed
him
away
so
she
could
look
at
him
bill
are
you
still
stuttering
n
bill
said
and
kissed
her
my
stutter
is
gone
for
good
ye
he
said
i
think
this
time
it
gone
for
good
did
you
say
something
about
rock
and
roll
i
don't
know
did
love
yo
she
said
he
nodded
and
smiled
when
he
smiled
he
looked
very
young
bald
head
or
not
i
love
you
to
he
said
and
what
else
counts
he
awakens
from
this
dream
unable
to
remember
exactly
what
it
was
or
much
at
all
beyond
the
simple
fact
that
he
has
dreamed
about
being
a
child
again
he
touches
his
wife
smooth
back
as
she
sleeps
her
warm
sleep
and
dreams
her
own
dreams
he
thinks
that
it
is
good
to
be
a
child
but
it
is
also
good
to
be
grownup
and
able
to
consider
the
mystery
of
childhood
its
beliefs
and
desires
i
will
write
about
all
of
this
one
day
he
thinks
and
knows
it
just
a
dawn
thought
an
afterdreaming
thought
but
it
nice
to
think
so
for
awhile
in
the
morning
clean
silence
to
think
that
childhood
has
its
own
sweet
secrets
and
confirms
mortality
and
that
mortality
defines
all
courage
and
love
to
think
that
what
has
looked
forward
must
also
look
back
and
that
each
life
makes
its
own
imitation
of
immortality
a
wheel
or
so
bill
denbrough
sometimes
thinks
on
those
early
mornings
after
dreaming
when
he
almost
remembers
his
childhood
and
the
friends
with
whom
he
shared
it
